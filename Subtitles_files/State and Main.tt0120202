1
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:05,017
- State and Main -
"DEU A LOUCA NOS ASTROS"

2
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,133
Doc...

3
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:57,363
those pills you gave me
for my back,

4
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:59,463
I'm not sure that they work.

5
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:00,905
Well, I'm not sure either,

6
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,635
but you don't
hear me complain.

7
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:05,200
Step by the office

8
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:06,405
at the end of the afternoon.

9
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:07,811
Thanks, Doc.

10
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:10,375
They're kidding, right?

11
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:13,011
No, they're not kidding.
This is your movie.

12
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:15,077
This is small town America.

13
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:17,954
The town in New Hampshire
was small town America, too.

14
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:20,084
$40,000 a day
to shoot on the street

15
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:21,115
and then
they kick us out.

16
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,254
That's life
in the movie business.

17
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:25,127
But look here--

18
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:26,496
a jacket for $5.

19
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,057
I could buy this
whole town for 50 bucks.

20
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:29,693
You told me that
about the last town.

21
00:03:29,736 --> 00:03:31,169
Yeah, but they never
shot a movie here.

22
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:33,365
I'm bleeding, Bill.
I'm bleeding.

23
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:34,532
Why am I here?

24
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:37,372
What do they got
to pass for the old mill?

25
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,399
There you go.

26
00:03:38,445 --> 00:03:39,571
The Waterford Mill.

27
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:42,240
Built in 1 825.
A longtime tourist attraction.

28
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:45,684
Wake up, Umberto.

29
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:49,385
We're here.

30
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:51,253
- Where are we?
- Give him a cigarette.

31
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,350
They send the old mill
from New Hampshire?

32
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:55,258
They're holding
our old mill for ransom.

33
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:56,990
- We build one.
- They got one.

34
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,930
We build a fire hut.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,901
Okay, but we have to
lose the window.

36
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:05,666
We can't lose the window.

37
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,696
Then I can't
do the shot, Wally...

38
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,140
You want me to push in
through the window.

39
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,473
Look.

40
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:13,945
I can't push in
through the window.

41
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,039
We go back
to New Hampshire, eh?

42
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:17,947
No, we can't ever
go back to New Hampshire.

43
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:20,111
No, we're going to
stay here.

44
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:21,745
This is what
my people die for--

45
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:24,723
the right to make a movie
in this town.

46
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:28,725
What was wrong
with the old traffic light?

47
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:30,092
I'm glad you asked.

48
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:31,289
I'll tell you
what was wrong with it,

49
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,856
it was behind the times.

50
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,925
- Good morning, darling.
- Morning.

51
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:37,493
You want to bring
business to this town,

52
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:39,505
you have to plan
for a Waterford

53
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,303
that does not exist.
Not at this moment, no.

54
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:43,934
You have to live
in the present, folks.

55
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:45,968
You can not live
in the past.

56
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,673
Good morning.

57
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:49,272
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi, Carla.

58
00:04:49,315 --> 00:04:52,716
I'm going to be a little late
for the rehearsal tonight.

59
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,549
It's okay, Maude.
Do you know your lines?

60
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,020
I know them.

61
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,454
I don't know
what order they come in.

62
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,321
We'll work it out.

63
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:02,760
Now, what shall we have
that's good to eat?

64
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:05,229
- What are they on about?
- Traffic light.

65
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:06,232
Jack's right.

66
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,530
Public office
is a public trust.

67
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:10,058
This is why
this is America.

68
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:11,127
That's right.

69
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,070
The question is
who owns the street?

70
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:14,733
That is the question.

71
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,725
Lots of room.

72
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,284
Uh huh.

73
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,258
Marty!

74
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,028
We got a new town.

75
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,433
Yeah, it's a--
Where are we again?

76
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,902
Waterford, Vermont.

77
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:47,065
Waterford, Vermont.

78
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:48,038
It's--

79
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:49,564
Where is it?

80
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:51,543
That's where it is?

81
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:53,739
Here, talk to Bill.

82
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,611
You have got to get me
Main Street for nothing.

83
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:57,115
I will.

84
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,176
Marty, Bill.

85
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:01,914
Okay, put her on.

86
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:02,922
Yup.

87
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:04,446
Kathy,

88
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,957
stand by.

89
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:12,792
Everyone goes
to Waterford, Vermont.

90
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:18,298
Well, look on
a bigger map.

91
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,430
God, she makes
me cranky.

92
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:21,064
May I help you?

93
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:23,735
Yeah, I'd like to speak
to the manager.

94
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:26,142
Would you like
a room?

95
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,943
No, we want to rent
the whole hotel.

96
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,418
Because.

97
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:36,581
Because we don't
have to build an old mill.

98
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:38,591
They have an old mill.

99
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,059
Yeah, it's on a stream.

100
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,061
That's where you put
an old mill.

101
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:44,063
- They run on water.
- Uh huh.

102
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:45,359
Okay, I'm looking at--

103
00:06:45,398 --> 00:06:46,922
I've got scene 1 2.

104
00:06:46,966 --> 00:06:48,194
Come in.

105
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:50,725
Uh huh.
Thank you.

106
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,829
Shouldn't you be
in school?

107
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:54,305
It's night.

108
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:58,672
Scene 1 2,
the arrival at the mill.

109
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,611
All right, work it out
and get back to me.

110
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:01,705
Mr. Price?

111
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:03,443
What?

112
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:04,814
What is it?
We're working.

113
00:07:07,186 --> 00:07:08,653
Bring it in on time
and there's more

114
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,155
where these came from.
Marty.

115
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:13,386
P.S., I want to talk to you
about a product tie-in.

116
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:14,552
Somebody make a note.

117
00:07:14,594 --> 00:07:16,585
I want for the broad--
What does she like?

118
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:17,960
Lilacs.

119
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:20,625
A truckload of lilacs
when the broad comes.

120
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,658
And get something
for Bob Barrenger.

121
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:24,294
Get him--
What does he like?

122
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:26,396
Bob Barrenger? Bob Barrenger
is in this movie?

123
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,236
- That's correct.
- He's staying here?

124
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:29,639
Put something in his room.
What does he like?

125
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:31,371
1 4-year-old girls.

126
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:32,776
Well, get him
something else.

127
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:35,246
Let's try to get out
of this town in one piece.

128
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:37,977
Get him half
a 28-year-old girl.

129
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:39,746
How's my math?

130
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,853
Woman:
Who wanted these storyboards?

131
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,118
Bill:
Sound department said

132
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:47,956
there's no hold up
on the KMR-81.

133
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,724
Two of the caterers
are down with botulism.

134
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:53,197
And Umberto tells me
he can't take this shot

135
00:07:53,232 --> 00:07:55,223
unless they let him
take out the Firehouse window.

136
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,168
I need my lucky pillow.

137
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:58,500
I need to talk to you
about her nude scene.

138
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:00,335
I need that permit
to shoot on Main Street.

139
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:01,772
I need to speak
to the mayor.

140
00:08:01,808 --> 00:08:03,571
- Well, speak to him.
- We can't find him.

141
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,735
Are you ever in school?

142
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,404
There are other things
to be learned.

143
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:07,435
Is that true?
Like what?

144
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,845
Like the mayor's here.

145
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:11,042
- What's his name?
- Mr. Bailey.

146
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,917
- Hi, Mr. Bailey.
- You've got to do these again.

147
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:14,920
Okay.

148
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,421
Mr. Bailey.

149
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:18,981
Mr. Bailey, Walt Price.

150
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,049
I'm going to be
your director.

151
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:21,219
I lost my typewriter.

152
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,956
I have to tell you,
I can not express to you

153
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:26,794
- how happy--
- We're glad to have you here.

154
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,495
No phone calls.
I'm with the mayor.

155
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:31,298
Yes, can I speak
to my wife, please?

156
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,133
This isn't our firehouse.

157
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:36,038
No, that's a firehouse
in New Hampshire.

158
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:37,804
Why did you
leave New Hampshire?

159
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:39,311
Would you like a cigar?

160
00:08:39,345 --> 00:08:40,903
Aren't these illegal?

161
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:42,346
Why would they
be illegal?

162
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:45,475
Well, the trade embargo
against Cuba.

163
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:47,918
Nobody tells me anything.

164
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:49,649
Well, you know, uh...

165
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:53,084
I'd like to say that

166
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:54,388
anything I can do--

167
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:57,021
That's very kind of you.
As a matter of fact,

168
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:58,325
I'd hate to bother you
with this...

169
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:00,730
We need a shooting permit
for Main Street.

170
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:02,962
Whatever you need.

171
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:05,232
Uh, the city council,
of course, will have to--

172
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,260
The city council.

173
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:08,535
--will have to pass
on your permit.

174
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:10,007
But that's less than
a formality.

175
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,031
It is?

176
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:13,602
I am the city council.

177
00:09:13,646 --> 00:09:16,410
Well, Mr. Mayor,
that's very kind of you.

178
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:18,417
My wife would like
to invite you

179
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:21,682
to have dinner with us
at our home.

180
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:23,552
And I hate to be
a pain about this--

181
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,150
Oh, I would be delighted,
are you kidding me?

182
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:29,821
Well, well, I won't
take more of your time.

183
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,489
No, not at all.

184
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:33,590
I can't imagine
the responsibility--

185
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,294
Actually I can imagine
because

186
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:38,167
once I had to video my
grandniece's confirmation...

187
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,366
Walt, it's Marty
on the coast.

188
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:43,466
We'll see you
Tuesday for dinner.

189
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,239
It was one of the great,
great pleasures meeting you.

190
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,678
Thank you.

191
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,544
Bye bye.

192
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:53,051
I found
your lucky pillow.

193
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,847
It's Marty on the coast.

194
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:58,015
Of course
he's on the coast.

195
00:09:58,057 --> 00:09:59,422
Where's he going to be,
the Hauge?

196
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:01,686
What?

197
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,388
Marty, hi?

198
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:05,454
The new town's cheaper
than the old town.

199
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:07,591
We're going to save
a fortune.

200
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:10,625
Because? Because we don't
have to rebuild the old mill.

201
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,572
They've got an old mill.
They've got a firehouse--

202
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:16,234
Baby, baby, baby,

203
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:19,608
I want to save the money
just as much as you do.

204
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:22,205
Just put it on the end
of the counter there.

205
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,808
Right on the counter.

206
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:26,341
Whoa? Whoa whoa whoa?

207
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:27,909
You wiped out the board?

208
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:30,422
Dinner with the mayor.
Write it big.

209
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:32,754
That's just what we need,
to miss dinner with the mayor.

210
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:35,590
Marty, we've got to talk
about this schedule.

211
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,721
I got to have an extra day
on the dead horse gag.

212
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:40,626
I'm serious.

213
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,860
No, it gets worse.

214
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:43,732
I need another half day
on the old mill pond.

215
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,602
We can't shoot
in the old mill.

216
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:50,676
Marty, uh...
call me back in two minutes.

217
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,371
We can't shoot
in the old mill.

218
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:55,107
I just talked to the mayor.
He told me anything we need.

219
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:57,707
- It burnt down.
- When did it burn down?

220
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,741
1 960.

221
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:03,782
Part of a spate
of suspicious fires.

222
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:05,586
The old mill--

223
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,183
You told me they had
an old mill.

224
00:11:07,393 --> 00:11:10,920
by a disturbed teenager,
were in fact the inspiration

225
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,557
for the Waterford Huskies.

226
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,759
Hi.

227
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,701
Does it have to be an old mill?
Where have you been?

228
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:20,205
I was in New Hampshire.
I was at the old location.

229
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:21,729
We can't shoot
the old mill.

230
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:27,008
You know, they told me
there were going to be jokes.

231
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:28,411
Kid the new guy.

232
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:29,539
That's not quite it.

233
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:31,447
The old mill burned down.

234
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:35,849
Can't you build
the old mill?

235
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:37,048
We're out of money.

236
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,989
You built the old mill
in New Hampshire.

237
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,653
They're holding
the old mill for ransom.

238
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:43,059
Oh.

239
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,730
Why did we have to
leave New Hampshire?

240
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:55,264
Hello, Marty.

241
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:57,868
What would they have used
instead of an old mill?

242
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,070
I need it tonight.

243
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:00,635
Yeah, Marty,
you were saying?

244
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,045
I can't write it.

245
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,207
Why?

246
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:04,546
I lost my typewriter.

247
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,517
Get Mr. White a typewriter.

248
00:12:06,552 --> 00:12:08,349
I can only write on manual.

249
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:09,979
I know the feeling.

250
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,922
Typewriter for Mr. White?

251
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,586
You know, that's a lie.

252
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:17,152
- That's a real fault.
- It's not a lie.

253
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,323
It's a gift for fiction.

254
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:21,797
Off you go.

255
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:25,604
Bill.

256
00:12:27,173 --> 00:12:28,435
How big is this horse?

257
00:12:28,474 --> 00:12:29,566
1 5 halves.

258
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:31,906
What is that in fingers?

259
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:34,412
Just kidding.
Get me this horse.

260
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:35,675
That horse is booked.

261
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:37,239
Tell the guy--
Get me this horse?

262
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:38,545
Tell the guy...

263
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:40,575
I'll give him
an Associate Producer credit.

264
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:53,760
I'll give the horse
an Associate Producer credit.

265
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,459
Put a VHS,
an air conditioner

266
00:12:57,503 --> 00:12:58,970
and a refrigerator
in that room,

267
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:00,404
she's gonna blow.

268
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:03,237
The labor with the first child
can sometimes be prolonged.

269
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,142
What's an Associate
Producer credit?

270
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:08,146
It's what you give
to your secretary

271
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,738
instead of a raise.

272
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:11,181
This isn't Evian water.

273
00:13:11,217 --> 00:13:12,548
It's water.

274
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:13,381
Can't sign for it, sorry.

275
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:14,647
She's going to blow.

276
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:15,984
Well, you rewire.

277
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:18,616
I rewire it, I have
to tear out half the wall.

278
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:22,053
I'm looking
for my typewriter.

279
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,086
- Bill, I found lilacs.
- Put them in her room.

280
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:28,191
Tommy, you got to send
somebody running

281
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:29,394
for a new dead horse.

282
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:30,959
Did they find
my typewriter?

283
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:32,834
- Bob! Bob!
- Oh, my God.

284
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:35,067
Mr. Barrenger, Mr. Barrenger!

285
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,132
I told you, all of you.
Get back, get back.

286
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:38,700
This man is a guest here.

287
00:13:40,012 --> 00:13:41,001
Hi, I'm uh...

288
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:42,139
Oh, sir, I know
who you are.

289
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:43,512
...Bob Barrenger.
I'm with the movie.

290
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,346
Sir, we're so...
We're so--

291
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:46,715
Front!

292
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:49,016
I've seen--
I know everybody says this,

293
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:52,252
but I've seen
every one of your movies.

294
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,986
Show Mr. Barrenger
to his room.

295
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:55,994
Your room is 21 4
through 1 7.

296
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:57,154
I'm Scott Larkin.

297
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:59,630
Anything you need,
this is my private line.

298
00:13:59,665 --> 00:14:00,825
Oh, thank you
very much, Scottie.

299
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,458
I'm just here to do
a job like the rest--

300
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:05,402
- Hey, Bob!
- Hey, Tommy.

301
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:07,065
I heard your wife's
having a baby.

302
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:08,073
Do they know
who the father is?

303
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:09,404
They think
it's your first wife.

304
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:10,466
Oh, that could be.

305
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,269
Now get out of here.

306
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:16,481
I'm going to get
you a list

307
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:17,914
of Mr. Barrenger's
dietary requirements.

308
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,747
- Mr. Barrenger!
- Chuckie, not today.

309
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,116
Mr. Barrenger
has just arrived.

310
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,882
Oh, that's all right.

311
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,350
Chuckie.

312
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:27,291
How do you
spell that, son?

313
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,260
With an ie?

314
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:31,286
Chuck, what are
your hobbies?

315
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,127
Baseball?

316
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,395
Baseball?

317
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:36,662
Chuckie...

318
00:14:38,704 --> 00:14:40,968
that's the national sport.

319
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,104
Thank you.

320
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,845
Here you go, Dad.

321
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:51,849
Man: I'll tell you what else.
In the land of freedom

322
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:53,818
we get to choose
what we have for breakfast.

323
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,912
You think that's nothing?
Go live under communism.

324
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:58,048
Here's your bowl of kasha.
Eat it and shut up.

325
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,923
Vanilla frappé,
two tuna BLTs,

326
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,587
What's a tuna BLT?

327
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:04,220
It's for
the movie people.

328
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:07,096
Well, I for one am glad
of a little diversion

329
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,566
and I'm glad
they're here.

330
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:09,295
What I'm saying is,

331
00:15:09,335 --> 00:15:11,200
we have to look out
for our own.

332
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:13,000
They want to close
down Main Street.

333
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,198
You want to talk
about Main Street,

334
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,867
why don't you fix
the pot hole?

335
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:17,535
Doug, it's--
what, three days?

336
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:18,873
Three, four days?

337
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:20,242
You know what
we're gonna have?

338
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,372
A record of our
wonderful life.

339
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:23,813
Why don't you stick

340
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:25,146
to the amateur theatricals?

341
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:27,345
This is not quite
the same thing, you see.

342
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:28,978
This is big business

343
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:31,717
in which our life
is no less a commodity than--

344
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:33,122
Help me out here.

345
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,649
Woman: Water or mineral deposits?

346
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:36,888
Well, that's what I'm saying.

347
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,055
I think that they're nice.

348
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:39,724
I'm sure they are.

349
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:41,255
As nice as they are...

350
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,666
they should be thankful
they can choose their breakfast.

351
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:46,102
Why? Because they don't
live under communism.

352
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:47,264
Communism's over.

353
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:50,104
That's what they said
about Warner Brothers in 1 985.

354
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:52,474
But if you look at their
price per share today...

355
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:54,945
Well, hard to argue
with that.

356
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,540
Dad, I've got to go to
Terry's house to study tonight.

357
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,709
I want you home by 9:00.

358
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:02,817
I want to tell you something.

359
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:05,619
You stay soft all your life,
people will despise you.

360
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:07,125
It awakens adverse in them.

361
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,490
They take advantage of you.

362
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,154
And that's human nature.

363
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:13,157
Oh, are you going to be
home tonight?

364
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,064
I might have something
important to tell you.

365
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,362
What is it,
a surprise?

366
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:18,267
That's right.

367
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,702
She could have
done better than him.

368
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:25,300
It takes all kinds.

369
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:26,675
That's what
it takes?

370
00:16:26,712 --> 00:16:29,272
I always wondered
what it took.

371
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:36,714
Excuse me.

372
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:40,247
Your sign says
you'd be back at 2:00.

373
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,816
It's a quarter
to 3:00.

374
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,691
Oh.
Uh...

375
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:55,700
You doing a play?

376
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:58,209
Local drama group.

377
00:16:58,244 --> 00:16:59,370
Northern Books.

378
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:02,440
No, it hasn't come in yet.

379
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,244
As soon as it does.

380
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:06,545
You too, Marge.

381
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:12,583
A little, small town, I suppose
you have to make your own fun.

382
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,252
Everybody makes
their own fun.

383
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,726
If you don't make it yourself
it ain't fun,

384
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:18,457
it's entertainment.

385
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,125
See my point?
Northern Books.

386
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,463
What can I do for you?

387
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:24,401
I need a typewriter.

388
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:25,266
We got them.

389
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:27,238
North--
No,

390
00:17:27,273 --> 00:17:30,401
Henry James was the novelist,
Frank James was a criminal.

391
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:33,002
Yup, you came
to the right place.

392
00:17:33,045 --> 00:17:36,139
Jesse James
was the brother...

393
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,649
of the novelist,
that's right.

394
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,482
That's all right, Suzy.
See you tomorrow.

395
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,290
Okay.

396
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:47,451
I want to rent this one.

397
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:49,427
Why don't you buy it?
Only 40 bucks.

398
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:51,429
I had one,
but they lost it.

399
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:53,328
You buy this typewriter,

400
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:54,662
I will get it
all spruced up for you,

401
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,962
good as new.
Better than new

402
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,263
because it has
some history.

403
00:17:57,303 --> 00:17:58,827
The other one
had history, too.

404
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,304
I wrote my play on it.

405
00:18:00,339 --> 00:18:02,068
You wrote a play on it?
What play is that?

406
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:03,039
You never heard of it.

407
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:03,939
What's it called?

408
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:06,069
Anguish.

409
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:09,478
Anguish,
by Joseph Turner White.

410
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:11,039
You're Joseph
Turner White?

411
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,984
- That's right.
- Good afternoon, Annie.

412
00:18:14,019 --> 00:18:18,251
Girls, this man
wrote this play.

413
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,382
Is that a fact?

414
00:18:19,425 --> 00:18:20,915
Well, is it a good play?

415
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,257
Yes, Maude, it is.
It's a very good play.

416
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:24,990
A very good play indeed.

417
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:27,894
What's he doing here?

418
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,127
What are you doing here?

419
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:30,157
Writing the movie.

420
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:31,863
You're writing the movie?

421
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:32,871
Yeah.

422
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:34,338
What's it about?

423
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:36,773
It's about
the quest for purity.

424
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:43,113
Scene blah blah blah,
they meet.

425
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:45,412
Sister, I've just
come from a fire.

426
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,442
There are some things
I want to think out?

427
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,351
That's bad because?

428
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:50,980
Because he wouldn't
say that.

429
00:18:51,023 --> 00:18:52,957
Look, Sister,
I've just come from a fire.

430
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:55,152
There are some things
I want to think out.

431
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:57,219
Come on.
Come on.

432
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,321
Leave me alone?
A gesture? All right?

433
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:00,354
What else?

434
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:02,390
Page three.
It's a nice evening.

435
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,594
I'm not gonna
say that,

436
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:04,863
It's a nice evening.

437
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:06,837
- Yeah, okay.
- Come on.

438
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:07,998
Yeah? Come in?

439
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:12,237
Joe?
You know Bob?

440
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,801
I grew up
on your movies.

441
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:15,837
Do you mind if I don't
go through the usual bullshit

442
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:17,348
about how much I loved it?

443
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:20,443
I mean, okay, fine,
but it's a motion picture.

444
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:21,817
You're gonna
bore them to death.

445
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,048
Come in?

446
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:28,022
I brought your sandwich.

447
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,288
Thanks, honey.

448
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:32,559
Next time bring two.
Save yourself a trip.

449
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:35,829
The people came to see
a motion picture.

450
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:36,596
Hold on.

451
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:38,125
No, no,
you can go.

452
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:40,502
Page five.

453
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,473
The fucking horse dies.

454
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:44,271
You know,
she could be in the movie.

455
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,571
- She could.
- Oh, boy.

456
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:46,908
She's got a good face.
She could be the doctor's--

457
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:49,106
Why does it
have to be his wife?

458
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:52,549
- It could be his, uh...
- Stick to business, will you?

459
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:55,883
- Can we do that?
- You're absolutely right.

460
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:58,685
You go start doing that stuff
in this town...

461
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,658
Hey, everybody
needs a hobby.

462
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:02,353
Okay, look, page--

463
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:05,991
Claire.

464
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,357
You know Bob Barrenger?

465
00:20:09,401 --> 00:20:12,962
I just saw  Desert Sun.
I want to tell you...

466
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:16,907
No, I was...
I was just learning on it.

467
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:18,876
How did you like working
with Richard Hill?

468
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:21,402
I loved it.

469
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:24,713
Joe White.

470
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:29,052
How can I thank you?

471
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:31,817
How can I repay you
for this part?

472
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,290
It's a...

473
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:34,690
What a...

474
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:36,626
Thank you for this part.

475
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:39,460
The first scene
at the old mill--

476
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:43,298
Joe's been having some thoughts
about the old mill scene.

477
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:45,235
What is there
to think about?

478
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,794
The scene is perfect.

479
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,170
I get to say--

480
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:52,837
Yeah, but Joe's been--
He's been having a few thoughts.

481
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,210
How many times
in your life

482
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:57,112
do you get
a speech like that?

483
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:58,241
Yeah.

484
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:01,184
This scene is why
I'm doing the movie.

485
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,778
Look at the mill, Frank.

486
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,584
Look at the way
it goes around.

487
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:06,750
Half the time
the darn wheel's under water,

488
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,987
but still
it rises up, Frank.

489
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:10,460
It rises up

490
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:12,987
as high as it can go.

491
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:14,157
Tsk.

492
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:19,535
Yeah.

493
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,062
Um, that's true.

494
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:24,871
Joe, you want to, um--

495
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,037
you want to tell Claire

496
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:30,048
about the thoughts
you've been having

497
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,141
about the old mill scene?

498
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:58,266
So young. So innocent.
So full of promise.

499
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,369
I beg your pardon?

500
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:10,146
I've got your typewriter.

501
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:11,815
I don't need it,
I quit.

502
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:13,825
- You quit?
- Quit the movie.

503
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,759
Why'd you quit?

504
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,728
Hey, why in the world
would you quit?

505
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:20,357
Why I quit
is not important,

506
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:23,527
but thank you
for your help.

507
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,194
Uh huh.

508
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:41,950
Actually, I'm not sure
if I quit.

509
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,477
I think I got fired.

510
00:22:43,522 --> 00:22:44,887
No.

511
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:47,721
I'm such a liar,
I never could tell the truth.

512
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,249
Don't be hard
on yourself.

513
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:52,593
But I just got
kicked off my first movie.

514
00:22:54,132 --> 00:22:56,532
Well, everybody
has reversals.

515
00:22:56,568 --> 00:22:58,331
If you were
never down,

516
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,031
how would you know
when you were up?

517
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,631
You have a gift
for words.

518
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:04,369
It's in your play.

519
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,574
Oh.

520
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:12,983
Evening, Annie.
See you at rehearsal.

521
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:14,610
You know your line?

522
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:18,145
Rise. One need not bend the knee
before the throne of justice.

523
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,782
Go, you Huskies.

524
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:21,190
Go, you Huskies.

525
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:23,319
He leaves the clothing
out all night?

526
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:24,761
Yup.

527
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:26,491
Isn't he afraid
it's going to get stolen?

528
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,396
Ain't worth stealing.

529
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:29,900
Only thing in town
worth anything

530
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:31,664
is that
stained glass window.

531
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:36,939
Waterford historic
firehouse, 1851.

532
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:38,875
Did you ever wonder
why the dalmatian

533
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,309
is the symbol
of the firehouse?

534
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:41,972
The first organized
fire department

535
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:43,879
was on the border
of Dalmatia and Sardinia

536
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,849
in the year 642.

537
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:48,819
That's why
the dalmatian?

538
00:23:48,854 --> 00:23:51,584
It was either that
or a sardine.

539
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,552
Morning, Bucky.

540
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,257
Here you go, pal.

541
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,628
You grew up here?

542
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:05,796
Central High and matinees
at the Bijou Theater.

543
00:24:05,837 --> 00:24:08,169
- Nice town.
- Oh, yeah.

544
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,805
Do you want
to talk about it?

545
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:18,911
Uh uh.

546
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:24,989
You see...

547
00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:31,389
the sanctity
of every day things.

548
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,692
Every day things, yes.

549
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:34,926
For example,

550
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:36,934
the heat's coming
from a fire,

551
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:38,993
and um--

552
00:24:39,037 --> 00:24:41,528
That's a fine house.

553
00:24:41,573 --> 00:24:44,371
You know when you look at that
you know nice people live there.

554
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:46,206
I live there.

555
00:24:46,244 --> 00:24:47,939
Really?

556
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,571
The porch swing
and everything?

557
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:51,343
Surest thing you know.

558
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:57,348
I don't mean
to impose, but...

559
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,822
do you think we might...

560
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:03,384
That's what
the swing's there for.

561
00:25:03,428 --> 00:25:05,089
That's what
the swing is there for?

562
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,324
Uh huh.

563
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,127
That's its purpose,
isn't it?

564
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,599
I always thought so.

565
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,439
It's such
a pleasant sound.

566
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:23,914
Uh huh.

567
00:25:25,517 --> 00:25:28,714
Because it's...

568
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:31,552
it's the simple things.

569
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,955
Well, there you are.

570
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,126
And have I got
big news for you.

571
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:41,899
This is Joe White
and this is... this is...

572
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:43,924
uh uh...

573
00:25:45,203 --> 00:25:48,832
my fiancé,
Doug Mc Kenzie.

574
00:25:48,874 --> 00:25:51,468
It's a pleasure.

575
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,707
Guess who is this close
to a nomination to State Senate,

576
00:25:54,746 --> 00:25:58,910
which is this close
to one step from Congress?

577
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,418
Who?

578
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:12,961
It was lovely
meeting--

579
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:15,398
Mr. White
is working on the movie.

580
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:16,559
It's a pleasure
meeting you.

581
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:18,626
- And we were just--
- Let me tell you,

582
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,967
they were a bit
coy at first.

583
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:22,030
I told them, look,
the people are tired.

584
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:23,700
They're going to vote
their pocket book, yes,

585
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:25,607
but they're going
to vote their heart.

586
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:26,838
How do I know?

587
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:28,368
I'm out there
with them every day.

588
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:29,573
Go down
to the lumber mills,

589
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:31,138
go down
to the truck stops

590
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:33,174
and you'll see people
of this great land

591
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,812
working, playing,
moving...

592
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:05,842
What happened in 1 975?

593
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:17,460
The 1 9--

594
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:24,929
Don't run off.

595
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,803
Don't run off.
We need you.

596
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,137
You know why?

597
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:32,575
You're why we're here.

598
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,909
Your script
is why we're here.

599
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,880
Big deal,
we fight a little bit.

600
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:39,281
You show me
a family that doesn't.

601
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:40,682
But we've got
something good here.

602
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:42,744
You know what it is?

603
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,950
We're here to make
a movie.

604
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,481
We can't use
the old mill.

605
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:50,119
That happens.
What you got to do,

606
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:51,753
you've got to figure out
the essence.

607
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:54,424
What is it
that brought us all here?

608
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:57,492
It wasn't a building, Joe.

609
00:27:57,535 --> 00:27:59,196
It was an idea.

610
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:01,000
What is the essence
of your story, Joe?

611
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,207
It's about a man
who gets a second chance.

612
00:28:05,243 --> 00:28:07,211
Then you write that.

613
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:09,179
And then this is
our second chance.

614
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:11,512
That's why
we're all here.

615
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:13,244
I want to make
a good film.

616
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:14,809
I know you do!

617
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:19,053
Maybe it will be
a better film

618
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,182
without the old mill.

619
00:28:20,225 --> 00:28:22,250
Hey, it's with the gods.
We don't have the money.

620
00:28:22,294 --> 00:28:24,455
We got to write it out,
the best or not.

621
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,561
And that's a lesson.

622
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,260
Did you get
your typewriter yet?

623
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:30,563
No.

624
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:32,092
Grace,

625
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:33,126
get on the other phone.

626
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,435
Get Mr. White
his typewriter.

627
00:28:35,473 --> 00:28:37,634
Have what's her name send
up some nosh.

628
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:38,836
What do you
like to drink?

629
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:42,005
- I don't drink,
- Did my matzos come?

630
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:44,015
Get some for everybody.

631
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:46,210
Thank you.

632
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:48,219
Let me tell you
about my first picture.

633
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:11,933
The chairs go.

634
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:14,571
- The lazyboy goes.
- Not the lazyboy.

635
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:16,603
The lazyboy goes.

636
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:18,309
Hi, Sherry.
Where do you want it?

637
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,442
Put it in
the living room.

638
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:21,179
And we have
13 at table.

639
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:22,743
We don't have
13 at table.

640
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:24,812
Bob Barrenger,
Claire Wellesley, the director--

641
00:29:24,856 --> 00:29:27,620
- Invite someone else then.
- I don't want to invite someone else.

642
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,422
Because this is the most
exclusive dinner--

643
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:31,986
Well, then you do
whatever makes you happy.

644
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,998
I'll be back
with the butter churn.

645
00:29:34,032 --> 00:29:36,000
And we need
a blunder buss.

646
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:39,561
The woman's gone crazy
about this dinner party.

647
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:41,333
George.

648
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:43,432
I want a city
council meeting.

649
00:29:43,475 --> 00:29:44,874
City council?

650
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,241
Doug, the traffic light--

651
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:48,472
Fuck the traffic light.

652
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,413
I'm talking about 3%
of the adjusted gross

653
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:51,938
of a major motion picture.

654
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:55,710
Hi.

655
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,654
I love your script.

656
00:29:58,857 --> 00:30:01,348
- What?
- You're still here.

657
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:02,917
Morning, Annie.

658
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:04,451
See you
at rehearsal tonight.

659
00:30:04,496 --> 00:30:07,021
In the name of justice,
sir, I bid you pause,

660
00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:08,828
for she is our queen.

661
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:09,993
That's very good.

662
00:30:10,035 --> 00:30:13,198
In fact, I'm not sure if
I gave them a second chance

663
00:30:13,238 --> 00:30:14,899
or if they're
giving it to me.

664
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,999
That's the truth.
The truth's best, don't you think?

665
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:19,840
You'd know
better than me.

666
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:21,470
How can you say that?

667
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:23,947
It's in your script.

668
00:30:23,982 --> 00:30:26,849
It's about getting
a second chance, isn't it?

669
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:28,750
You can go back.

670
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:32,382
But how do I...
how do I do a film

671
00:30:32,424 --> 00:30:35,882
called The Old Mill
when I don't have an old mill?

672
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:38,225
Well, first you got
to change the title.

673
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:41,722
No, he doesn't
want to work out

674
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:43,631
with the Waterford Huskies.

675
00:30:43,668 --> 00:30:45,499
Because he's Bob Barrenger.

676
00:30:45,537 --> 00:30:47,232
Call his girl in Aspen.

677
00:30:47,272 --> 00:30:48,500
Get her to ship his weights.

678
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,837
There you go, sir.

679
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:52,843
Well, fine, then he's not
going to do the pond scene.

680
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:55,402
Not unless he can work out.

681
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:59,543
Call his girl in Aspen,
get her to ship the weights out.

682
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,176
How much can they weigh?

683
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:03,244
Walt, are these
the ones?

684
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:06,655
Yes. Who designed
these costumes?

685
00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:07,919
Who designed
these costumes?

686
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,722
It looks like
Edith Head puked

687
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:12,025
and that puke designed
these costumes.

688
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:13,792
- Get Courtney.
- Your wife's on the phone.

689
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:16,323
I have no wife?

690
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:17,595
Okay.

691
00:31:19,404 --> 00:31:21,099
Tommy,

692
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:23,073
we need a new name
for the movie.

693
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:24,598
Where's the writer?

694
00:31:24,642 --> 00:31:25,609
Roger.

695
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:31,040
Wally, I got to take out
the window from the dog.

696
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:33,050
- Walt?
- I can't shoot through...

697
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:35,314
- What?
- Claire has a problem.

698
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:38,914
If I have a moment
of your time.

699
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:41,016
- I cannot do the shot you want.
- Why not?

700
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:43,527
Because it's got a window
with dogs in it.

701
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:46,462
You want me to push in,
or lose the shot.

702
00:31:46,498 --> 00:31:48,363
No, you cannot
lose the shot.

703
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
The meaning of the film
is in that shot.

704
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:53,360
- But the window to the Fire--
- I don't care.

705
00:31:53,404 --> 00:31:56,430
Fix it.

706
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:59,534
- Courtney...
- Hmm.

707
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:01,135
Did you show Claire
these sketches?

708
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:02,771
- Yes.
- Did she throw up?

709
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:04,179
That's not very nice.

710
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,705
Oh, really?

711
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,741
Why don't you sue me
in the world court?

712
00:32:07,785 --> 00:32:09,184
Did she like
the costumes?

713
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,619
- I can't tell.
- Why not?

714
00:32:10,655 --> 00:32:12,145
She won't stop crying.

715
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,249
Oh, goody.

716
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:16,021
Find out when
Marty Rossen's arriving.

717
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,925
Get some lilacs
to send to the broad.

718
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:19,054
The town's out of lilacs.

719
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:24,892
You go to her room, you take
the lilacs from the water,

720
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:26,563
dry them,
get some cellophane,

721
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:29,573
wrap them up,
get a card from Marty.

722
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:31,700
Right.

723
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:34,536
What's her problem?

724
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,547
She doesn't want
to bare her breasts.

725
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:37,946
She doesn't want
to bare her breasts.

726
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:39,244
In the nude scene?

727
00:32:39,284 --> 00:32:41,184
Why are we paying her
$3 million?

728
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:42,618
She got religion.

729
00:32:42,654 --> 00:32:46,181
Her religion bars her
from fulfilling her contract.

730
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,550
Claire?

731
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:26,154
Claire.

732
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:29,394
Claire?

733
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:34,598
What is it, pal?

734
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:37,635
What?

735
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:41,273
I can't do it, Walt.

736
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:42,643
You can't do what?

737
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,648
It isn't right.
I can't.

738
00:33:44,682 --> 00:33:47,014
I know I signed
the contract.

739
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:50,851
I don't know if they told me
it was in the contract.

740
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:53,186
Forget the contract.
What is it?

741
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:56,125
I don't want to take
my shirt off.

742
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,628
What are these things
they're asking of me?

743
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:01,029
What?
I try to be good.

744
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:02,498
The only thing
I care about...

745
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:05,127
- I know that.
- ...is the movie.

746
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,727
I know that.
We all know.

747
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:10,263
- Everybody, they treat me--
- No, they don't.

748
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:12,299
They treat me like a child.

749
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,072
Now, Claire...

750
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:16,137
To bare my body--

751
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,648
What are they
asking of me?

752
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:21,083
Now look, Claire.

753
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,746
I want to tell you
a story--

754
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:24,755
What?

755
00:34:27,492 --> 00:34:31,622
Fuck flowers?
This isn't about flowers.

756
00:34:31,663 --> 00:34:33,631
This is about a human being.

757
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,291
Lilacs.

758
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:38,393
Who are these from?

759
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:39,232
Marty.

760
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,830
That's very
thoughtful of him.

761
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,433
- Eleanora Duse--
- I can't.

762
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:47,375
Listen to me.

763
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:49,778
Eleanora Duse
was playing Hamlet

764
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:51,543
in London in 1 905

765
00:34:51,582 --> 00:34:54,050
and Royalty
could not get a ticket.

766
00:34:54,085 --> 00:34:58,749
She said, I'm not doing the
seven shows a week I signed for.

767
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,021
She said, I can't bare
my soul seven times a week.

768
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,652
I am an artist.

769
00:35:03,695 --> 00:35:05,253
I'll do four shows a week.

770
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:07,230
The greatest actress
of her time.

771
00:35:07,265 --> 00:35:10,257
And do you know
what her producer said?

772
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:11,427
What?

773
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:15,030
Nothing.
He held her and he wept,

774
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:20,511
because he understood that
was her life's blood on the stage.

775
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:23,070
I know. I know.

776
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:25,605
And did she?

777
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,481
She did the seven shows?

778
00:35:27,518 --> 00:35:29,349
No, she didn't.

779
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:31,184
But I think
you should do this scene.

780
00:35:31,222 --> 00:35:32,120
Wally.

781
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:34,989
I know. I know.

782
00:35:35,026 --> 00:35:37,051
It's the hardest thing
in the world.

783
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:40,258
And sometimes it seems
everybody wants a--

784
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:43,529
- Yes.
- wants a piece of us.

785
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:44,865
And you know what?

786
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:48,966
We have to give it.

787
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:50,633
I don't know
what her problem is.

788
00:35:50,675 --> 00:35:53,769
She takes her shirt off
to do a voice over.

789
00:35:53,811 --> 00:35:55,176
What's her problem?

790
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:57,681
The country could draw
her tits from memory.

791
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:09,253
- I--
- Bill...

792
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:10,851
call her agent
in New York.

793
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:12,658
Tell him she's breaking
her contract.

794
00:36:12,697 --> 00:36:15,131
We're very upset
with her.

795
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:16,793
Get someone
to double for her.

796
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:18,597
Her tits.
The tit scene.

797
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:19,694
Call L.A.

798
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:22,171
I want to see pictures
of women's tits.

799
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:23,264
I'm very sorry.

800
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:26,367
You're very sorry, you passive
aggressive son of a bitch?

801
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:27,378
Can we replace him?

802
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:29,175
We start shooting
in three days.

803
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:30,840
You want to see
the fireman's costumes?

804
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:32,406
Because I found this
moleskin for the color?

805
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,350
Marty Rossen's
touched down.

806
00:36:34,385 --> 00:36:36,512
It's not black,
but it looks black.

807
00:36:36,554 --> 00:36:37,521
It's not brown--

808
00:36:37,555 --> 00:36:40,922
Yup, it's faggy without
being homosexual.

809
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:47,826
Wait, wait, wait.
wait, wait.

810
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:49,765
He gets a second chance,
do you see?

811
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,166
And you get
a second chance.

812
00:36:51,202 --> 00:36:52,726
No, I don't.

813
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,499
He doesn't go back
to the mill.

814
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:57,997
He gets a second chance
to go back to the firehouse.

815
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:00,738
You don't need
the old mill.

816
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:03,781
This is what--
you see?

817
00:37:03,815 --> 00:37:06,545
This is what your-- This
is what the script is saying?

818
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:07,608
Hi, Annie.

819
00:37:07,652 --> 00:37:08,983
Hi, Emma,
see you tonight.

820
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,079
- Go, you Huskies.
- Go you, Huskies.

821
00:37:11,122 --> 00:37:14,717
What I see you saying is you have
the two elements, fire and water.

822
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:16,624
The firehouse
and the old mill.

823
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:18,128
You know, you could--

824
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:19,424
What are you
doing tonight?

825
00:37:19,464 --> 00:37:21,056
- Me?
- Yeah.

826
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:22,690
Tonight?

827
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:24,792
I have play practice.

828
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:26,531
Oh.

829
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:30,436
That's important.

830
00:37:34,178 --> 00:37:35,805
Come on, people.
Let's hump it. Let's go!

831
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:40,214
Yeah.

832
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:42,879
Let's go, let's go!
Come on, come on.

833
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:48,050
You call
the broad out?

834
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:49,286
No, I left that
for you.

835
00:37:49,327 --> 00:37:51,158
That's thoughtful.

836
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:52,321
Mmm, this is good.
Did you try this?

837
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,456
Oh, I'm really going
to eat carbohydrates.

838
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:55,989
Dump this somewhere.

839
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,031
What did you do,
build this?

840
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:04,200
- How was your flight?
- We're flying over pigs.

841
00:38:04,242 --> 00:38:06,972
- We're flying over sheep.
- Did you bring Bob's weights?

842
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:08,603
They're coming FedEx.

843
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:10,910
- What's in the bags?
- My undies.

844
00:38:10,948 --> 00:38:13,781
'Cause you can't get this picture
off, I'm going to wet myself.

845
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:17,083
- I'm going to get it off.
- 55 days I take home the camera.

846
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:19,589
Oh, I got an idea
for a product placement--

847
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:21,455
- Hi, Shelly.
- Hi, Doc.

848
00:38:21,492 --> 00:38:24,154
- How's the arm?
- Still itching.

849
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:26,026
Good. A sign
it's getting well.

850
00:38:27,632 --> 00:38:29,327
Good afternoon.

851
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:31,858
- Stop.
- That's what I told you.

852
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:34,235
How are you getting on
with these fine people?

853
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,968
Like dykes and dogs.

854
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:39,772
Did you see the grosses
for Ghandi II?

855
00:38:45,182 --> 00:38:46,342
Yeah? Come in?

856
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,046
Ah, good.

857
00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:53,486
I just uh...

858
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,257
Prices are going up.

859
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:01,555
That's the way
of the world, isn't it?

860
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,089
Everybody's got to eat.

861
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:05,102
The way of the world.

862
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:09,599
I'm being pretty impolite.

863
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:12,370
Would you like some?

864
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,844
I don't eat vegetables.

865
00:39:16,347 --> 00:39:18,542
Well, I could offer you
something to drink.

866
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,847
Sure, what have you got?

867
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:22,443
What do you drink?

868
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,784
Bourbon and milk.

869
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:28,950
How old are you?

870
00:39:36,968 --> 00:39:38,595
Then I hope
you wouldn't tell anyone

871
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:40,536
that I gave this to you.

872
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:43,005
I would never tell anyone
anything that happened

873
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,440
between me and somebody
who was my friend.

874
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:52,246
Yeah.

875
00:39:55,286 --> 00:39:56,583
Nice town you got here.

876
00:39:56,621 --> 00:40:00,387
We could see it a lot better
if we were on the roof.

877
00:40:00,424 --> 00:40:03,120
Wouldn't that
be dangerous?

878
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,253
Not if you have
something to hold onto.

879
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:17,231
The requirement is you
tell me what the shot is.

880
00:40:17,274 --> 00:40:20,675
Because if you cannot
tell me what is it

881
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,702
how can I take
pictures of it?

882
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:28,617
Wally wants me to push in
through the window.

883
00:40:28,653 --> 00:40:30,245
How can I push in
through the window?

884
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:32,187
- Yeah. No. Um...
- Telephone.

885
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:34,214
Scusa.

886
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:35,885
Pronto?

887
00:40:50,975 --> 00:40:53,307
Hello.
How are you?

888
00:40:53,344 --> 00:40:55,107
I thought you had
play practice.

889
00:40:55,146 --> 00:40:57,410
- What happened?
- The cast stood me up.

890
00:40:57,448 --> 00:41:00,315
They're all preparing
for the auditions for your movie.

891
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,379
My glasses fell apart.
I lost the--

892
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:07,448
Lost the screw?

893
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:09,049
- Good evening, Annie.
- Evening, sweetheart.

894
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:10,321
Go, you Huskies.

895
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:11,794
You said it.

896
00:41:14,532 --> 00:41:15,658
Do you like kids?

897
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:19,197
I never saw
the point of them.

898
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:21,898
Me, too.

899
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:24,499
Do you have a paper clip
to fix my glasses?

900
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:26,100
Better idea.

901
00:41:28,045 --> 00:41:30,377
Hold up, Cathy,
I need you.

902
00:41:30,414 --> 00:41:31,972
Oh, watch out
for that lure.

903
00:41:34,418 --> 00:41:36,386
Can I get some
fishing line?

904
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:40,047
Okay, let's see
what we've got.

905
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:48,094
A little fishing line,
a little country wisdom

906
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,861
and the world's our oyster.

907
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,460
I'm going to fix you up
a brand new hinge.

908
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:53,936
It'll be as good as new.

909
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:55,871
Better than new
because it has a story.

910
00:41:55,906 --> 00:41:57,305
Uh huh.

911
00:41:57,341 --> 00:41:59,741
Presto chango.

912
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:02,302
The inherently
helpful qualities

913
00:42:02,346 --> 00:42:04,712
of every day
household things.

914
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:06,717
Uh huh.

915
00:42:06,751 --> 00:42:07,581
There you go.

916
00:42:07,618 --> 00:42:09,984
Let me try it.

917
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:14,050
Careful you don't
burn yourself.

918
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:15,080
Ow!

919
00:42:15,126 --> 00:42:16,525
God.

920
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:22,298
You know what
you got there?

921
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,528
You got a fish hook
in your finger.

922
00:42:25,603 --> 00:42:27,161
I'm right proud of you.

923
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:32,468
Let me tell you something,
Wally he's a pussycat.

924
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,809
My thing is to see everybody
does what they said they would.

925
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,143
Now what is this?

926
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:40,275
You want $800,000 to do
what you're being paid to?

927
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:41,875
You already signed
you'd do?

928
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:42,886
What is that?

929
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,013
I think I should
talk to my agent.

930
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:46,716
You and I should...
we should really--

931
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,384
- Who is her agent?
- Mitch Cohen.

932
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:49,392
Get him on the phone.

933
00:42:49,426 --> 00:42:50,654
He's on the island.

934
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:53,629
Get him on the phone?
I want you to hear this.

935
00:42:53,664 --> 00:42:54,688
It's ringing.

936
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:57,064
I really think
that business matters

937
00:42:57,101 --> 00:42:58,329
should be discussed
between you two.

938
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:01,065
I'm gonna discuss them between
you because it's your idea.

939
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:05,269
If you're going to sign to do a job
and then hold us up, you are in error.

940
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:07,300
- He's on the phone.
- Thank you.

941
00:43:07,344 --> 00:43:09,335
Mitch, this is Marty Rossen,
I'm here in...

942
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,281
- Waterford, Vermont.
- I'm somewhere on location.

943
00:43:12,316 --> 00:43:15,479
I'm going to solve it here
or this bimbo you sent me

944
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:18,420
is going to be doing a donkey
act on public access television.

945
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,349
- Hi.
- Her tits. Her tits?

946
00:43:23,394 --> 00:43:26,192
That she signed
in her contract.

947
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,425
We hired her because of 1 0 years
at the actor's studio?

948
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:29,864
The way she played Medea?

949
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,801
Her last two pictures laid
on the screen like my first wife.

950
00:43:32,837 --> 00:43:34,930
- You have no right--
- Cool it, you started this.

951
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:36,837
- What's the--?
- Where have you been?

952
00:43:36,874 --> 00:43:40,901
You tell me, you tell me now.
I got to shoot on Wednesday!

953
00:43:40,945 --> 00:43:42,708
I will not pay
your blood money.

954
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,714
P.S. I put the word
out on the street

955
00:43:44,748 --> 00:43:47,114
and Betty Boop can look
for work in squiggle-vision?

956
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:48,118
Sit down.

957
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:51,144
I don't think you should
talk to a lady like that.

958
00:43:51,188 --> 00:43:53,383
- Would you excuse me, please?
- You can't treat me like this.

959
00:43:53,424 --> 00:43:55,051
I'm not a child.

960
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:57,424
- She's absolutely right.
- I'm not a child?

961
00:43:57,461 --> 00:44:00,294
I have feelings.
I mean, don't you--

962
00:44:00,331 --> 00:44:02,561
Don't--
Don't--

963
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,568
Because I want to
tell you something

964
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:07,537
and I think you know
what I mean.

965
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,509
Well, you call him
and you call me back,

966
00:44:13,544 --> 00:44:15,944
but this is it, pal.
You fuck with me

967
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,311
and I'm going
to tear out your heart

968
00:44:17,348 --> 00:44:19,680
and piss on your lungs
through the hole in your chest.

969
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:22,811
And the best to Marion.
Where have you been?

970
00:44:22,853 --> 00:44:25,117
He says they're looking
for you all day.

971
00:44:25,155 --> 00:44:26,918
You're on salary,
he needs pages.

972
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:28,584
What are you--?
You been haguing?

973
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:29,820
- Now--
- Marty?

974
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,986
Later for that,
let's get this.

975
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:33,155
We need the pages
for The Old Mill.

976
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:35,165
We need a new title.
We need--

977
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,190
Rewrite for Bob,
the dead horse scene.

978
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:38,599
Whatever it is,
go do it.

979
00:44:38,636 --> 00:44:39,967
How are you doing
on the permit?

980
00:44:40,004 --> 00:44:42,165
- It's just a formality.
- That's why I want it.

981
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:44,333
Go on, type it up
and get it back to me.

982
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:45,637
I can't.

983
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:46,938
Don't tell me
you can't write it.

984
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:48,604
No, I can write it.
I can't type it.

985
00:44:48,646 --> 00:44:50,045
Why?

986
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,513
Hurt my finger.

987
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:53,675
Get a typist.
Get him a typist!

988
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:55,947
Get out of here.

989
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:58,716
Get out of here or we're
going to have you killed.

990
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,890
800 grand
to show her tits.

991
00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:05,918
Pay her.

992
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:06,793
I don't got the money.

993
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,922
Find the money.

994
00:45:07,965 --> 00:45:09,227
I got a company
that will give us

995
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:11,791
a million dollars to put
their product in the film.

996
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:13,029
A product placement.

997
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,470
- Yeah, take a look.
- What is it?

998
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,665
No no no no!

999
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:20,176
Just find me the money!

1000
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:26,411
This is Joe White in 201.

1001
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,179
They're sending up
a typist.

1002
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,984
Okay. No, I thank you.
It's here.

1003
00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,887
Come in.

1004
00:45:33,924 --> 00:45:35,357
Hi.

1005
00:45:36,894 --> 00:45:38,384
Hi.

1006
00:45:38,429 --> 00:45:39,555
May I come in?

1007
00:45:40,597 --> 00:45:41,564
Please.

1008
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,274
You said, You can't talk
that way to a lady.

1009
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,278
You stood up for me.

1010
00:45:57,581 --> 00:45:58,775
What do you have
to drink?

1011
00:45:58,816 --> 00:46:00,511
I don't drink.

1012
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:02,610
Matzoh.

1013
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:07,880
Are you Jewish?

1014
00:46:07,925 --> 00:46:09,324
Well, actually--

1015
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,554
I love Jewish men.

1016
00:46:12,129 --> 00:46:13,460
Why?

1017
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:15,226
You know.

1018
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,231
Where's your bathroom?

1019
00:46:22,673 --> 00:46:24,470
You liked
the script, huh?

1020
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:34,315
- Where have you been.
- Hi.

1021
00:46:37,755 --> 00:46:40,246
- We had a date.
- We did?

1022
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:43,225
- Where have you been?
- I've been thinking.

1023
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,659
Well, I know,
because they told me

1024
00:46:44,695 --> 00:46:46,356
you were with that writer
from the--

1025
00:46:46,397 --> 00:46:49,025
You see,
this is what I mean.

1026
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:51,500
The whole town's
been warped

1027
00:46:51,535 --> 00:46:53,435
by the presence
of the movie company.

1028
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,461
They holler
and we jump.

1029
00:46:55,506 --> 00:46:56,598
You have a date,
they call,

1030
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,164
you're doing business
9:00 at night.

1031
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,869
I wasn't doing business.

1032
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,174
Oh, well, what
were you doing, then

1033
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:04,680
that's so important you
shouldn't call your fiancé?

1034
00:47:04,715 --> 00:47:06,683
I...
have to tell you

1035
00:47:06,717 --> 00:47:09,277
that's it's all over
between us, Doug.

1036
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:13,555
I...

1037
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:16,491
met somebody else
and it's very serious

1038
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:18,085
and it's over.

1039
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:21,359
Wait. So serious you couldn't
call to tell me you'd be--

1040
00:47:21,398 --> 00:47:22,865
What did you say?

1041
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,959
It's all over between us.

1042
00:47:25,002 --> 00:47:26,970
I've met someone else.

1043
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:30,637
Who is this person
that you've found?

1044
00:47:30,674 --> 00:47:32,972
He works on the movie.

1045
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,478
No, don't tell me that.

1046
00:47:35,512 --> 00:47:37,343
I'm sorry.

1047
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:48,689
Can you type?

1048
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:51,057
If you can,
they need you at the hotel.

1049
00:47:51,095 --> 00:47:52,687
Can you type?

1050
00:47:52,729 --> 00:47:55,129
Never admit you can type.

1051
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:56,655
Okay.

1052
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,740
All right, look--

1053
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,748
I feel so close to you.

1054
00:48:11,782 --> 00:48:13,545
I like you very much.

1055
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:15,051
I like you, too.

1056
00:48:15,085 --> 00:48:16,677
Look, I met someone.

1057
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:20,754
- Who is it?
- Room service.

1058
00:48:20,791 --> 00:48:22,486
Could you leave it
just outside the door?

1059
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:24,357
You have to sign for it.

1060
00:48:26,897 --> 00:48:27,727
Would you excuse me?

1061
00:48:27,764 --> 00:48:29,129
Of course.

1062
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:33,393
- Hi?
- Oh, God.

1063
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:36,065
I'm going to be your typist
for this evening.

1064
00:48:36,106 --> 00:48:38,438
And here's some
hydrogen-peroxide.

1065
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:39,567
I don't drink.

1066
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,043
It's for your finger.

1067
00:48:41,078 --> 00:48:43,410
That's very thoughtful.

1068
00:48:43,447 --> 00:48:45,813
Here I am.
Shall we get down to it?

1069
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:52,611
Thought you might
like these.

1070
00:48:52,656 --> 00:48:54,351
Well, thank you
very much.

1071
00:48:55,592 --> 00:48:57,526
Read the card.

1072
00:48:57,561 --> 00:49:00,587
To the love of my life.
Love, Doug.

1073
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:02,394
The other side.

1074
00:49:02,432 --> 00:49:04,297
Oh.
Wait! Wait.

1075
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:05,528
Where are you going?

1076
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:07,730
Don't you think we should
put these in water?

1077
00:49:07,771 --> 00:49:09,568
For God's sake, why?

1078
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:12,404
Because if you don't,
they die?

1079
00:49:12,442 --> 00:49:13,773
Hmm.

1080
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:16,669
And in my opinion
that makes them

1081
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:19,204
so much
less attractive.

1082
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:20,876
Wait wait wait!
Don't do that.

1083
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:22,886
You shouldn't do that.
Wait.

1084
00:49:24,154 --> 00:49:26,418
Yup, the little things
mean a lot.

1085
00:49:26,456 --> 00:49:28,788
Yes, the little things
mean a lot.

1086
00:49:28,825 --> 00:49:30,816
It's so true.

1087
00:49:30,861 --> 00:49:34,729
For example, I once had
an uncle who was bit by a spider

1088
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:36,323
and he lost
his sense of smell.

1089
00:49:38,302 --> 00:49:39,997
Can I have a cracker?

1090
00:49:47,678 --> 00:49:49,168
Shouldn't we start?

1091
00:49:50,914 --> 00:49:52,245
Let's start--

1092
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,247
Start typing.

1093
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:56,946
This isn't a good time.

1094
00:49:56,987 --> 00:49:59,683
Oh, all right.

1095
00:50:00,724 --> 00:50:05,184
Then I'll come back
at a better time.

1096
00:50:05,229 --> 00:50:06,423
What would be
a better time?

1097
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,896
Later on.

1098
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:09,421
Then I'll come back then.

1099
00:50:15,706 --> 00:50:17,674
You going out with
your fiancé tonight?

1100
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,232
No, no,
that's not happening.

1101
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,869
I'll see you tomorrow.

1102
00:50:35,692 --> 00:50:36,886
Hi.

1103
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:39,585
Hi.

1104
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,621
It occurred to me
you'd want to have this,

1105
00:50:41,665 --> 00:50:43,895
sort of as a memento
of our--

1106
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:46,494
Oh, I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

1107
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:50,363
She came in here--

1108
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:52,466
Wait, she--

1109
00:50:52,509 --> 00:50:53,999
I was giving her
a massage.

1110
00:50:55,045 --> 00:50:56,706
Wait.

1111
00:50:56,747 --> 00:50:58,772
Wait,
she came in here--

1112
00:50:58,815 --> 00:51:00,077
She--

1113
00:51:00,117 --> 00:51:01,414
With all due respect,

1114
00:51:01,451 --> 00:51:03,043
she took off her clothes

1115
00:51:03,086 --> 00:51:04,178
and she got into bed

1116
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:06,212
and I told her
we could not

1117
00:51:06,256 --> 00:51:07,746
because we don't
know each other--

1118
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:10,157
We had a script
conference.

1119
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:11,956
And I said,
Thank you very much.

1120
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:15,192
I had a couple
questions about a line.

1121
00:51:15,232 --> 00:51:16,426
But, uh--

1122
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,966
It was inconvenient
because...

1123
00:51:21,004 --> 00:51:22,699
because--

1124
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:24,366
You can do it.

1125
00:51:24,408 --> 00:51:26,672
Because I met
someone else.

1126
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,610
Oh, okay.

1127
00:51:28,645 --> 00:51:29,634
You believe that?

1128
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,648
I do if you do.

1129
00:51:31,682 --> 00:51:33,411
But it's absurd.

1130
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,851
So is our electoral process
but we still vote.

1131
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:40,988
Wait.

1132
00:51:41,024 --> 00:51:44,221
Do you truly think the
electoral process is absurd?

1133
00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:46,229
I used to go out
with a politician.

1134
00:51:46,263 --> 00:51:48,128
You used to go out with him?
You broke up with him?

1135
00:51:48,165 --> 00:51:49,826
Time for a change.

1136
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:53,028
Keep your margins straight.

1137
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,537
Yes.

1138
00:52:25,202 --> 00:52:28,296
Don't worry
about that permit.

1139
00:52:28,338 --> 00:52:31,569
That is right fine
of you, Mr. Mayor.

1140
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:32,870
George.

1141
00:52:32,909 --> 00:52:34,774
- Morning, George.
- Chuckie.

1142
00:52:34,811 --> 00:52:36,039
Sherry,
your brother's here.

1143
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,513
We're glad
to have you here.

1144
00:52:38,548 --> 00:52:39,845
My wife, Sherry,

1145
00:52:39,883 --> 00:52:42,716
we're having a party
Tuesday night--

1146
00:52:42,753 --> 00:52:44,311
Walt and Bob Barrenger--

1147
00:52:44,354 --> 00:52:46,822
invite them over--
home cooked meal.

1148
00:52:46,857 --> 00:52:50,793
- If you'd like to join us.
- I'd be honored.

1149
00:52:50,827 --> 00:52:53,921
- Sherry, this is Mr., uh...
- Where the hell have you been?

1150
00:52:54,965 --> 00:52:56,489
It's a quarter after 9:00.

1151
00:52:56,533 --> 00:52:58,763
- I've been on the phone--
- Morning, Mrs. Bailey.

1152
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:01,236
I have two days--

1153
00:53:01,271 --> 00:53:03,330
This is Mr. Rossen.
He is the producer--

1154
00:53:03,373 --> 00:53:05,671
- Hello.
- I am so glad to meet you?

1155
00:53:05,709 --> 00:53:08,507
We're glad to have you here
and welcome to our--

1156
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,640
Yearly, we redecorate
to restore it

1157
00:53:12,682 --> 00:53:14,877
to the original
1 835 condition.

1158
00:53:14,918 --> 00:53:18,149
- What is that?
- The house.

1159
00:53:18,188 --> 00:53:21,521
The original kitchen,
of course, burned in 1 960,

1160
00:53:21,558 --> 00:53:23,753
as part of a spate
of suspicious fires,

1161
00:53:23,794 --> 00:53:26,524
which in fact,
lead to the inspiration

1162
00:53:26,563 --> 00:53:28,588
of the formation
of the Waterford Huskies?

1163
00:53:28,632 --> 00:53:29,690
My, oh, my!

1164
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:31,792
Would you like
a cup of tea?

1165
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:34,668
George, I have
to talk to you.

1166
00:53:34,704 --> 00:53:36,968
This is Mr. Rossen.
He's the producer.

1167
00:53:37,007 --> 00:53:38,235
I want you
to hear this, pal.

1168
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:41,767
Forget the overages, forget
$1 0,000 for three days to two weeks.

1169
00:53:41,812 --> 00:53:44,372
Do you know what it would cost
to build this town as a set?

1170
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:46,314
$6 million.

1171
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,681
Now the Waterford
Merchant's Association

1172
00:53:48,718 --> 00:53:51,551
demands through me
as their council

1173
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:54,022
5% of the profits
of the movie,

1174
00:53:54,057 --> 00:53:57,515
as geared to the most
favorable definition of profits

1175
00:53:57,561 --> 00:53:59,051
of either A,
the producer--

1176
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:01,120
Counselor,
I am sure--

1177
00:54:01,164 --> 00:54:02,688
No, I am positive,

1178
00:54:02,732 --> 00:54:04,222
we can reach some
accommodation.

1179
00:54:04,267 --> 00:54:06,633
I am thrilled and relieved
to hear you say that,

1180
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:09,036
and thank you, sir.
What did you have in mind?

1181
00:54:09,072 --> 00:54:12,200
Don't tell me you
don't have any wallpaper.

1182
00:54:12,242 --> 00:54:13,470
I told you we could
have it by Wednesday.

1183
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:15,876
Don't tell me you don't
have any wallpaper.

1184
00:54:15,912 --> 00:54:18,642
The biggest grossing
box office star in the world

1185
00:54:18,682 --> 00:54:20,513
is coming to dinner
on Tuesday.

1186
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:21,881
Well, if you'd ordered
something common...

1187
00:54:21,918 --> 00:54:24,386
I'm going to give you
something common.

1188
00:54:24,421 --> 00:54:26,446
I'm going to give you
an injunction as well.

1189
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,616
Mr. Mayor.

1190
00:54:27,657 --> 00:54:29,022
Mr. Mayor--

1191
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:31,118
Why you cheap,
little heb.

1192
00:54:31,161 --> 00:54:35,928
Assembly of Death did
$95 million the first weekend.

1193
00:54:35,966 --> 00:54:37,797
Yeah, but those grosses
are inflated.

1194
00:54:37,834 --> 00:54:38,960
You think so?

1195
00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:41,800
Well, you got to look
at the per screen averages.

1196
00:54:43,974 --> 00:54:45,805
Hi, Annie.

1197
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:49,710
I'm sorry I haven't been
to a meeting of the drama club.

1198
00:54:52,516 --> 00:54:54,177
Oh, that's too bad.

1199
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,080
Hello.

1200
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:03,326
What's the matter?

1201
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:06,295
I can't seem to get it
to come out right.

1202
00:55:08,098 --> 00:55:09,065
What's the scene?

1203
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:11,158
It used to be
the old mill.

1204
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:12,668
What do you got?

1205
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:15,034
They meet on Main Street,

1206
00:55:15,071 --> 00:55:17,164
her horse has just died.

1207
00:55:17,207 --> 00:55:19,300
He's coming from the fire.

1208
00:55:19,342 --> 00:55:21,333
Annie, do you want
something to eat?

1209
00:55:21,378 --> 00:55:23,710
What's the scene about?

1210
00:55:23,747 --> 00:55:26,739
I don't know anymore.

1211
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:28,216
Have you seen Carla?

1212
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:29,218
No.

1213
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:33,646
He sees her
on the street.

1214
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,715
He wipes the soot
from his eyes.

1215
00:55:35,759 --> 00:55:38,421
He goes up to her--

1216
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:40,486
What happened
to the horse?

1217
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:43,761
He-- She...

1218
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,427
looks at him.

1219
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:46,799
She takes his hand--

1220
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:47,962
- Ow.
- I hurt you.

1221
00:55:48,004 --> 00:55:49,767
I hurt your finger.

1222
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:50,830
What happened
to his finger?

1223
00:55:50,874 --> 00:55:52,842
It was burnt.

1224
00:55:52,876 --> 00:55:54,207
Then it was really hurt.

1225
00:55:54,244 --> 00:55:57,270
Ah ah ah?

1226
00:55:57,314 --> 00:55:59,544
That's what she says.

1227
00:56:00,584 --> 00:56:02,643
That's what she says.

1228
00:56:02,686 --> 00:56:04,210
He says,

1229
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:07,951
Sister, I've come
from a fire.

1230
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:13,554
But she realizes

1231
00:56:13,597 --> 00:56:15,588
it was not the fire
that hurt him,

1232
00:56:15,632 --> 00:56:17,964
that the true hurt
was her.

1233
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:23,234
- Was her unbridled sexuality...
- Yes. Yes.

1234
00:56:23,273 --> 00:56:27,676
because, because
it's about purity.

1235
00:56:27,711 --> 00:56:29,906
It's... it's...

1236
00:56:29,946 --> 00:56:31,914
it's...

1237
00:56:31,948 --> 00:56:36,009
And then you don't need
the nude scene.

1238
00:56:36,052 --> 00:56:38,020
Because it's about purity!

1239
00:56:38,054 --> 00:56:41,820
Take any two people--
Take you and me--

1240
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:54,837
I've always thought so.

1241
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:58,864
The finest people you could
ever hope to work with.

1242
00:56:58,908 --> 00:57:00,239
Do you have the new
old mill pages?

1243
00:57:00,276 --> 00:57:01,641
I can't find the writer.

1244
00:57:01,678 --> 00:57:03,009
Totally false.

1245
00:57:04,114 --> 00:57:05,376
Totally false.

1246
00:57:05,415 --> 00:57:09,909
He is the most responsible
human being I have ever--

1247
00:57:09,953 --> 00:57:12,114
- I have to talk to you.
- Not now.

1248
00:57:12,155 --> 00:57:13,588
My wife is going
to have a baby.

1249
00:57:13,623 --> 00:57:15,318
That's great.
Let's bring more people

1250
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:17,121
into this
over crowded world.

1251
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,422
Yes?

1252
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:21,997
Yes, I know
what you mean.

1253
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:25,491
Yes, that's very,
very true.

1254
00:57:25,535 --> 00:57:26,661
Take it off.

1255
00:57:26,703 --> 00:57:28,898
Take off that stupid,
fucking shirt right now.

1256
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:30,769
Take it off.

1257
00:57:30,807 --> 00:57:34,174
Well, if I had to say
one thing,

1258
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:37,611
it's about purity.

1259
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:39,342
Miss Wellesley's
bags, please.

1260
00:57:39,382 --> 00:57:40,781
Claire?

1261
00:57:40,817 --> 00:57:42,079
The plane is waiting.

1262
00:57:42,118 --> 00:57:43,779
I've written a letter
to the studio

1263
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,220
and to SAG protesting--
Get a copy of that letter.

1264
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:48,986
I just want to say
I am past chagrin.

1265
00:57:49,025 --> 00:57:51,459
I am mortified at the way
you were spoken to.

1266
00:57:51,494 --> 00:57:53,325
An artist of your caliber.

1267
00:57:53,363 --> 00:57:55,763
When I read this script
I said there is only

1268
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:57,494
one person to play
that part.

1269
00:57:57,534 --> 00:57:59,024
The minute I read
the script I said--

1270
00:57:59,069 --> 00:58:00,400
I know.

1271
00:58:00,437 --> 00:58:02,837
I said she works
with animals,

1272
00:58:02,872 --> 00:58:04,169
she has a home.

1273
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:05,731
A woman who--

1274
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:08,642
The community respects her.
Please don't go.

1275
00:58:08,678 --> 00:58:12,079
Please don't go.
What can I do but beseech you?

1276
00:58:12,115 --> 00:58:13,446
Trauma? Toil?

1277
00:58:15,018 --> 00:58:17,111
All things must end.

1278
00:58:18,088 --> 00:58:20,613
You just get an idea
and try to find

1279
00:58:20,657 --> 00:58:22,955
the best way
to express it pictorially.

1280
00:58:22,992 --> 00:58:23,959
Claire?

1281
00:58:23,993 --> 00:58:24,982
Claire.

1282
00:58:26,396 --> 00:58:28,864
As an interpretive artist
to a creative artist,

1283
00:58:28,898 --> 00:58:31,389
stay with me,
I need you.

1284
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:32,924
We start to shoot
in two days.

1285
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:34,527
Then it belongs to us.

1286
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:36,129
Stay.

1287
00:58:36,172 --> 00:58:39,073
Tonight when they've
all gone, let's talk.

1288
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:41,236
Let's really talk.
We'll have dinner.

1289
00:58:41,277 --> 00:58:43,768
A bottle of bad red wine.
We'll eat spaghetti--

1290
00:58:43,813 --> 00:58:45,440
I'm sorry,
it's gone beyond that.

1291
00:58:47,016 --> 00:58:49,416
I've enjoyed it, too.

1292
00:58:49,452 --> 00:58:52,012
I've always enjoyed
your publication.

1293
00:58:52,055 --> 00:58:54,387
Any time.

1294
00:58:54,424 --> 00:58:56,654
What does that woman
want from life?

1295
00:58:57,694 --> 00:59:00,390
She wants $800,000
to show her tits.

1296
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:01,761
Pay her off.

1297
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:03,629
- We don't have the money.
- Find the money.

1298
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,429
If you do
the product placement--

1299
00:59:05,468 --> 00:59:09,063
It's a computer company.

1300
00:59:09,105 --> 00:59:11,938
- Bazoomer Com?!
- Bazoomer dot com.

1301
00:59:11,975 --> 00:59:16,207
I can't put a computer
in a film shot in 1 895!

1302
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:18,146
You want to tell me
how to do that?

1303
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:19,944
The art department
had some ideas.

1304
00:59:19,983 --> 00:59:22,178
No no no no!
Just pay her off!

1305
00:59:22,218 --> 00:59:23,583
Call Howie.

1306
00:59:26,489 --> 00:59:28,616
Give me Howie Gold.

1307
00:59:28,658 --> 00:59:29,818
Howie, this is--

1308
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:32,692
I need 800 grand.

1309
00:59:33,897 --> 00:59:36,695
I don't care where
it comes from.

1310
00:59:36,733 --> 00:59:38,530
It comes out of our end.

1311
00:59:38,568 --> 00:59:40,331
Well, that's a shock.

1312
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:42,930
- I need--
- She doesn't show her tits?

1313
00:59:42,972 --> 00:59:44,564
Just get me the money.

1314
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:47,098
Hey, she doesn't
show her tits?

1315
00:59:47,143 --> 00:59:49,270
She doesn't show
her tits.

1316
00:59:49,312 --> 00:59:51,405
Her breasts
symbolize motherhood.

1317
00:59:51,447 --> 00:59:53,779
The breasts
symbolize motherhood?

1318
00:59:53,817 --> 00:59:56,081
The movie's about purity.

1319
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:57,882
So we don't show
her breasts.

1320
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:59,513
We show them to him.

1321
00:59:59,556 --> 01:00:01,114
She keeps her back
to the camera.

1322
01:00:01,157 --> 01:00:02,351
It'll hurt
the box office.

1323
01:00:02,392 --> 01:00:04,053
They know what
her tits look like.

1324
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:06,687
Know? They could
draw them from memory.

1325
01:00:09,532 --> 01:00:11,727
You are fantastic.

1326
01:00:11,768 --> 01:00:13,793
What a find you are?
Get out of here.

1327
01:00:13,837 --> 01:00:15,429
I still need
the dead horse scene.

1328
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:16,870
- I'm going to nail it.
- I know you are.

1329
01:00:16,906 --> 01:00:19,534
- Go, you Huskies.
- Go, you Huskies?

1330
01:00:19,576 --> 01:00:21,908
- Mr. Rossen?
- Yeah?

1331
01:00:21,945 --> 01:00:23,344
Thank you.

1332
01:00:24,414 --> 01:00:25,779
We just got the permit.

1333
01:00:25,815 --> 01:00:27,942
Stop her
at the airport!

1334
01:00:27,984 --> 01:00:29,008
Catch the broad
at the airport.

1335
01:00:29,052 --> 01:00:30,019
Send her back here.

1336
01:00:30,053 --> 01:00:32,487
Catch the broad
at the airport.

1337
01:00:32,522 --> 01:00:34,820
That Joe, he is
one hell of a kid.

1338
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:37,292
He just saved us
800,000 bucks?

1339
01:00:37,327 --> 01:00:38,851
He's got a gift
for fiction.

1340
01:00:38,895 --> 01:00:41,261
We got to do
something nice for him.

1341
01:00:41,297 --> 01:00:42,992
Hey, come here.

1342
01:00:43,032 --> 01:00:45,523
Turn around.

1343
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:47,263
Get him a bottle of--

1344
01:00:47,303 --> 01:00:49,328
Get him some maple syrup.

1345
01:00:49,372 --> 01:00:51,738
Stick this card on it
and put it in his room.

1346
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:54,402
- Who?
- Joe, the writer!

1347
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:57,276
Joe, the writer,
maple syrup, yes, sir.

1348
01:00:57,313 --> 01:00:59,713
Grows on trees.

1349
01:00:59,749 --> 01:01:02,616
Actually, it's an extract
of the tree.

1350
01:01:02,652 --> 01:01:04,085
Oh, bullshit.

1351
01:01:06,422 --> 01:01:09,653
I see some of our buddies got
themselves a part in the movie.

1352
01:01:09,692 --> 01:01:12,320
You see where Tom Miller
is playing the old farmer.

1353
01:01:12,362 --> 01:01:15,331
He's been playing the
old farmer now for 60 years.

1354
01:01:15,365 --> 01:01:18,391
I read for that part.
I did pretty well, too.

1355
01:01:18,434 --> 01:01:19,560
I bet you did.

1356
01:01:19,602 --> 01:01:21,467
But I couldn't remember
all the words.

1357
01:01:21,504 --> 01:01:23,369
Asked them would they
give me a second chance.

1358
01:01:23,406 --> 01:01:24,998
Ain't no second
chances in life.

1359
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:27,407
- Is that true?
- The only second chance we get

1360
01:01:27,443 --> 01:01:30,071
is to make the same
mistake twice.

1361
01:01:43,026 --> 01:01:45,017
The only...

1362
01:01:45,061 --> 01:01:48,656
second chance...

1363
01:01:48,698 --> 01:01:50,962
is the chance...

1364
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,195
to make the same--

1365
01:02:17,894 --> 01:02:20,488
Okay, you're going
to be all right.

1366
01:02:26,936 --> 01:02:28,335
So that happened.

1367
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:29,599
Are you all right?

1368
01:02:30,974 --> 01:02:33,875
- Am I all right?
- Yeah.

1369
01:02:36,346 --> 01:02:38,678
Well, I'm going
to tell you something.

1370
01:02:38,715 --> 01:02:40,205
We have to get her
out of here.

1371
01:02:40,249 --> 01:02:41,716
Who?

1372
01:02:47,023 --> 01:02:50,151
- Are you all right?
- What?

1373
01:02:50,193 --> 01:02:52,525
You gotta get out of here.

1374
01:02:53,863 --> 01:02:55,091
All right.

1375
01:02:57,433 --> 01:02:58,661
No.

1376
01:02:59,736 --> 01:03:01,704
You gotta get out of here.

1377
01:03:03,106 --> 01:03:04,403
Oh.

1378
01:03:05,842 --> 01:03:07,104
Oh.

1379
01:03:08,244 --> 01:03:09,506
Okay.

1380
01:03:19,722 --> 01:03:22,122
But here's the kicker--

1381
01:03:22,158 --> 01:03:23,648
Do you have a cigarette?

1382
01:03:23,693 --> 01:03:24,785
What?

1383
01:03:26,529 --> 01:03:27,928
No, forget about it.

1384
01:03:45,081 --> 01:03:47,072
No, he's fine, Howie,
he's going to be fine.

1385
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:49,209
He got knocked
around a little bit.

1386
01:03:49,252 --> 01:03:51,777
You're going to be fine.
I'll stop by tomorrow.

1387
01:03:51,821 --> 01:03:53,948
Thanks for your help.

1388
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,287
It's what I do
for a living.

1389
01:03:55,324 --> 01:03:58,691
Seriously, thank you
for helping us out.

1390
01:03:58,728 --> 01:04:01,322
Believe it or not,
I've seen it all before.

1391
01:04:03,433 --> 01:04:05,298
Howie wants
to talk to you.

1392
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:08,997
Hey, Howie.

1393
01:04:09,038 --> 01:04:10,027
I'm fine.

1394
01:04:10,073 --> 01:04:11,870
I'll be ready Wed--

1395
01:04:11,908 --> 01:04:14,900
I'm here to make
a movie, don't worry--

1396
01:04:14,944 --> 01:04:17,708
Hey, pal, when did
I ever let you down be--

1397
01:04:17,747 --> 01:04:19,180
Okay, babe.

1398
01:04:19,215 --> 01:04:21,308
I love you, too.

1399
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:24,217
He wants to talk
to you about the...

1400
01:04:24,253 --> 01:04:27,518
Howie, I'm calling
you back, two minutes.

1401
01:04:27,557 --> 01:04:29,616
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1402
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:31,627
I reached over to--
the girl had to be home.

1403
01:04:31,661 --> 01:04:33,151
I don't know,
a school night--

1404
01:04:33,196 --> 01:04:34,823
Bobby--

1405
01:04:34,864 --> 01:04:37,059
Everybody needs a hobby.

1406
01:04:39,702 --> 01:04:42,262
I wonder if I can take
a moment of your time.

1407
01:04:42,305 --> 01:04:43,465
I need a day off.

1408
01:04:43,506 --> 01:04:45,235
My wife is having
a rough time.

1409
01:04:45,274 --> 01:04:47,902
Thank you for keeping
me current.

1410
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:53,406
Howie Gold, please.

1411
01:04:53,449 --> 01:04:55,110
Walt Price,
I was just on with him.

1412
01:04:55,151 --> 01:04:56,948
Walt?

1413
01:04:56,986 --> 01:04:58,044
He's fine.

1414
01:04:58,087 --> 01:05:00,521
If there's anything
I can do--

1415
01:05:00,556 --> 01:05:01,955
No no no,
you've done it.

1416
01:05:01,991 --> 01:05:03,618
Thank you.
It's going to be fine.

1417
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:06,992
Howie, Walt here?
I'm sorry, it's crazy.

1418
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:09,224
No no no, he's 110%.

1419
01:05:09,265 --> 01:05:12,894
He got banged on the head.
He got a shot of adrenaline.

1420
01:05:12,935 --> 01:05:15,130
What request for money?

1421
01:05:15,171 --> 01:05:17,867
Howie, what request--?
That Marty--?

1422
01:05:17,907 --> 01:05:19,272
Is Mr. Barrenger
in there?

1423
01:05:21,444 --> 01:05:23,935
Howie, I'm going
to call you right back.

1424
01:05:25,515 --> 01:05:27,608
It's really raining
out there, huh, officer?

1425
01:05:29,352 --> 01:05:30,512
I guess it is.

1426
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:32,885
Could I see
Mr. Barrenger, please?

1427
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:46,695
Okay, what is she,
1 9, 20?

1428
01:05:48,804 --> 01:05:51,967
- Oh, Christ!
- Look-- Okay. Okay.

1429
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:54,408
You're driving...
countryside, so on.

1430
01:05:54,443 --> 01:05:56,172
You picked her up,
she was hitch hiking--

1431
01:05:56,212 --> 01:05:58,407
No, she hid in the back
of your car.

1432
01:05:58,447 --> 01:05:59,744
- It happens all the time.
- Wait wait wait.

1433
01:05:59,782 --> 01:06:01,545
Can I see
Mr. Barrenger, please?

1434
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:03,484
Wait, we can't put her
in the car.

1435
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:06,044
She gets it in her head
to sue or rape--

1436
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:09,546
- She wasn't in the car.
- You were all alone.

1437
01:06:09,592 --> 01:06:11,059
There's no witnesses.

1438
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:12,651
There's no witnesses, right?

1439
01:06:12,695 --> 01:06:14,993
No, just Joe.

1440
01:06:15,031 --> 01:06:16,055
Joe, the writer.

1441
01:06:16,098 --> 01:06:17,690
Just him and me.

1442
01:06:17,733 --> 01:06:20,258
Then she wasn't
in the car. Say it.

1443
01:06:21,804 --> 01:06:23,635
She wasn't in the car.

1444
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:38,384
Mr. Barrenger?

1445
01:06:38,421 --> 01:06:39,888
Yes?

1446
01:06:39,922 --> 01:06:41,116
I'm very sorry to--

1447
01:06:41,157 --> 01:06:42,715
What seems to be
the problem?

1448
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:44,783
I have to ask you
some questions.

1449
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:51,793
Do you have a valid
driver's license?

1450
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:53,028
Of course he has.

1451
01:06:53,069 --> 01:06:54,593
Could I see it, please?

1452
01:06:55,972 --> 01:06:58,566
- What?
- Your driver's license.

1453
01:07:12,288 --> 01:07:14,256
Were you
under the influence?

1454
01:07:15,424 --> 01:07:16,982
No.

1455
01:07:20,129 --> 01:07:22,097
And who was
driving the car?

1456
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,636
I was alone in the car.
I was driving the car.

1457
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,069
Uh huh.

1458
01:07:29,105 --> 01:07:32,563
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger,
I'm very sorry.

1459
01:07:32,608 --> 01:07:35,008
In fact, I'm as sorry
as I can be, but--

1460
01:07:35,044 --> 01:07:36,477
I'm an attorney,
if there's anything

1461
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:37,706
you have to say
to Mr. Barrenger,

1462
01:07:37,747 --> 01:07:39,942
you can say it to me.

1463
01:07:39,982 --> 01:07:41,609
I have to give you
this ticket

1464
01:07:41,651 --> 01:07:43,209
for damage
to city property.

1465
01:07:43,252 --> 01:07:45,982
I'm really sorry, sir.
It's a formality.

1466
01:07:46,022 --> 01:07:47,353
You have to what?

1467
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:48,414
It's a formality.

1468
01:07:48,457 --> 01:07:50,755
Any case of damage
to city prop--

1469
01:07:50,793 --> 01:07:53,387
You hit the control box
of the new stop light

1470
01:07:53,429 --> 01:07:56,523
and they're going
to send you a bill.

1471
01:07:56,565 --> 01:07:59,056
They'll, uh--
These things happen.

1472
01:07:59,101 --> 01:08:01,331
I hope
you're all right.

1473
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:05,170
Don't worry, but that's
so sweet of you.

1474
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:08,301
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay more pleasant.

1475
01:08:12,214 --> 01:08:14,205
We appreciate
your concern, officer.

1476
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,411
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

1477
01:08:16,452 --> 01:08:18,113
Yeah?

1478
01:08:19,322 --> 01:08:20,755
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

1479
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:23,054
Walt Price.

1480
01:08:23,092 --> 01:08:24,286
No, no.

1481
01:08:25,528 --> 01:08:26,688
He's fine.

1482
01:08:28,497 --> 01:08:30,727
Well, he's right here.

1483
01:08:30,766 --> 01:08:32,825
You're not to see
that girl again.

1484
01:08:32,868 --> 01:08:34,563
Do you understand me?

1485
01:08:35,805 --> 01:08:36,999
Hello?

1486
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:39,439
No, he's right here.
Would you like to--

1487
01:08:39,475 --> 01:08:41,966
Bob, are you
all right?

1488
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,808
- Hi?
- Hi.

1489
01:08:48,851 --> 01:08:49,840
Where are you going?

1490
01:08:49,885 --> 01:08:53,821
- Going home.
- Going home? Yeah.

1491
01:08:56,592 --> 01:08:59,220
- I told them what you said.
- What?

1492
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,058
I told them what you said
about the script.

1493
01:09:01,097 --> 01:09:03,759
I didn't say anything.
I was just talking out loud.

1494
01:09:03,799 --> 01:09:07,166
- How else can you talk?
- No, that's true.

1495
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:13,906
I told them you can't
portray with the picture

1496
01:09:13,943 --> 01:09:16,741
what you're saying
with the words.

1497
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:18,770
I don't know, the movies--
I don't know.

1498
01:09:18,814 --> 01:09:20,304
They should be
socially uplifting.

1499
01:09:20,349 --> 01:09:22,112
Why does she
have to show her--

1500
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:24,308
What is this?

1501
01:09:24,353 --> 01:09:26,446
Yes, sir,
Joseph Knight's print shop.

1502
01:09:26,489 --> 01:09:28,320
Vacant for 30 years.

1503
01:09:28,357 --> 01:09:31,155
- Is it?
- Yup, and it's for sale.

1504
01:09:33,996 --> 01:09:35,156
You want to see it?

1505
01:09:35,197 --> 01:09:37,791
I have the key
in my store.

1506
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,926
I'd love to.

1507
01:09:55,351 --> 01:09:56,909
How's your movie star?

1508
01:09:56,952 --> 01:09:58,943
Gosh, you look nice.

1509
01:10:03,592 --> 01:10:05,560
What?

1510
01:10:05,594 --> 01:10:08,154
What are you going to
do with it, the print shop?

1511
01:10:08,197 --> 01:10:10,688
Oh.

1512
01:10:17,873 --> 01:10:20,637
It's wet out there.

1513
01:10:20,676 --> 01:10:23,406
Hey, slip into something
more comfortable.

1514
01:10:25,047 --> 01:10:27,379
So what would
you do with it?

1515
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:28,314
The print shop?

1516
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:31,876
Start back up
The Waterford Sentinel.

1517
01:10:31,921 --> 01:10:34,583
The Waterford Sentinel?

1518
01:10:34,623 --> 01:10:36,181
Town newspaper.

1519
01:10:36,225 --> 01:10:37,385
I got it all worked out.

1520
01:10:37,426 --> 01:10:38,950
Yeah?

1521
01:10:38,994 --> 01:10:41,462
- Show you the plans?
- Sure.

1522
01:10:46,535 --> 01:10:50,232
1 865, Devil's Tail Press.

1523
01:10:50,272 --> 01:10:53,435
The Waterford Sentinel,
the voice of the mountains.

1524
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:56,603
You shall not
bear false witness.

1525
01:11:02,284 --> 01:11:05,378
- The press still works?
- It did as of last week.

1526
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:06,945
You printed
the poster here?

1527
01:11:06,989 --> 01:11:09,583
The best way I know
to get ink on your hands.

1528
01:11:12,027 --> 01:11:14,552
Well--

1529
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:16,462
Oh my.

1530
01:11:16,499 --> 01:11:17,625
Life in the country.

1531
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:31,541
The past comes
to our rescue once again.

1532
01:11:41,123 --> 01:11:44,456
Yeah, you could
print the newspaper here.

1533
01:11:44,493 --> 01:11:46,893
That's something
a man could do.

1534
01:11:48,264 --> 01:11:50,459
You know what else
a man could do?

1535
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,058
What?

1536
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:00,736
One moment.

1537
01:12:02,411 --> 01:12:03,878
All right, out you go.
Don't come back.

1538
01:12:03,913 --> 01:12:05,608
Go home, Bucky.
Go home, boy.

1539
01:12:11,687 --> 01:12:15,248
I left the keys inside
in my jacket.

1540
01:12:19,061 --> 01:12:20,756
Well--

1541
01:12:22,364 --> 01:12:25,629
I suppose
I should be...

1542
01:12:27,503 --> 01:12:28,834
heading home.

1543
01:12:28,871 --> 01:12:30,133
Evening, Annie.

1544
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:33,531
Evening, Cal.

1545
01:12:33,576 --> 01:12:35,009
Got an umbrella?

1546
01:12:35,044 --> 01:12:36,102
No.

1547
01:12:36,145 --> 01:12:38,739
That's all right.

1548
01:12:38,781 --> 01:12:41,545
You can have my coat.
I'll walk you home.

1549
01:12:41,584 --> 01:12:42,983
Then you'll be wet.

1550
01:12:43,018 --> 01:12:46,249
I'm going off shift.
Come on, I'll walk you home.

1551
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,111
People.
People, people, people.

1552
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:50,584
Every movie's got to be
about something,

1553
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:53,918
and it's got to be about
just one thing.

1554
01:13:53,956 --> 01:13:55,548
What is this movie about?

1555
01:13:55,591 --> 01:13:58,492
It's about what we always
said it was about.

1556
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:02,520
We were lost, but now
we're back on the right track.

1557
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:05,624
You see, what I'm saying?
The movie is about purity.

1558
01:14:05,668 --> 01:14:06,828
Barrenger:
I've always seen that.

1559
01:14:06,869 --> 01:14:08,166
So we don't show
your breasts,

1560
01:14:08,203 --> 01:14:09,795
we show
your reaction to it.

1561
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:13,706
- I am so comfortable with that--
- It was Joe's idea.

1562
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:15,369
And you were
exactly right.

1563
01:14:15,411 --> 01:14:17,572
- This is great work.
- Thank you so much.

1564
01:14:17,613 --> 01:14:19,672
We're not out of the woods.
I need that dead horse scene.

1565
01:14:20,883 --> 01:14:22,851
I have Mr. Barrenger's
tuna BLT.

1566
01:14:22,885 --> 01:14:23,715
Thank you.

1567
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:25,720
I tried to take it
to him in his room--

1568
01:14:25,754 --> 01:14:26,812
I think he's moved.

1569
01:14:29,091 --> 01:14:32,322
You know what Walt said
makes a lot of sense.

1570
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:37,431
Listen, the audience isn't
coming to see your breasts.

1571
01:14:37,466 --> 01:14:39,093
They're coming
to see your acting.

1572
01:14:39,134 --> 01:14:42,069
- What are you doing this evening?
- I'm having dinner with Walt.

1573
01:14:42,104 --> 01:14:43,537
- Do you want to come?
- Do you mind?

1574
01:14:43,572 --> 01:14:47,372
- Not at all, you kidding me?
- Isn't she a trip?

1575
01:14:47,409 --> 01:14:49,502
We're going to have
some local food,

1576
01:14:49,545 --> 01:14:51,809
some roadhouse--
Joe, wanna go?

1577
01:14:51,847 --> 01:14:53,246
Got a date.

1578
01:14:53,282 --> 01:14:55,147
Already he's learned
how to write a movie

1579
01:14:55,184 --> 01:14:57,243
and he's found some girl
to get his toes curled.

1580
01:14:57,286 --> 01:14:59,311
- You're a monster!
- Too kind.

1581
01:14:59,354 --> 01:15:00,514
Quit your kidding.

1582
01:15:00,556 --> 01:15:02,114
How are we coming
with the dead horse scene?

1583
01:15:02,157 --> 01:15:03,886
You can't actually
kill the horse.

1584
01:15:03,926 --> 01:15:05,621
Oh, fuck me.

1585
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:11,361
Yes, yes, I'm trying.

1586
01:15:13,769 --> 01:15:15,430
When is your mom coming?

1587
01:15:15,471 --> 01:15:17,268
Oh.

1588
01:15:17,306 --> 01:15:19,137
What did the midwife say?

1589
01:15:19,174 --> 01:15:20,539
Where are we
going to dinner?

1590
01:15:20,576 --> 01:15:21,907
Did you get
a reservation?

1591
01:15:21,944 --> 01:15:23,172
You were going
to book us--

1592
01:15:23,212 --> 01:15:25,237
Where is my schedule?
Where we going to dinner?

1593
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,508
What's your problem?

1594
01:15:26,548 --> 01:15:27,810
My wife's
having a baby.

1595
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:29,249
Is that on
the call sheet?

1596
01:15:29,284 --> 01:15:32,742
Or is that
personal business?

1597
01:15:32,788 --> 01:15:34,278
Oh, Christ, Marty!

1598
01:15:34,323 --> 01:15:35,381
Are we paying you?

1599
01:15:35,424 --> 01:15:36,823
I--

1600
01:15:40,596 --> 01:15:43,156
She didn't even finish
knitting me the sweater.

1601
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:44,426
Morning, Doc.

1602
01:15:44,466 --> 01:15:45,990
Morning.

1603
01:15:46,034 --> 01:15:47,934
What are you
doing here, Doug?

1604
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:49,403
I thought you started
out the day

1605
01:15:49,438 --> 01:15:50,735
with that pernicious
caffeine.

1606
01:15:50,773 --> 01:15:52,638
Kiss my ass.

1607
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:54,301
He's had a hard day.

1608
01:15:54,343 --> 01:15:56,072
Ann deserted him
for some guy on the movie.

1609
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:57,544
Well, they don't
always leave

1610
01:15:57,579 --> 01:15:58,671
with the ones
they come in with.

1611
01:15:58,714 --> 01:16:00,181
Big day last night.

1612
01:16:00,215 --> 01:16:01,910
Hoped to tell you.

1613
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,713
Didn't I pick
the fragments of glass

1614
01:16:03,752 --> 01:16:07,210
out of Bob Barrenger's
actual head myself?

1615
01:16:07,256 --> 01:16:08,723
- Morning, Carla.
- Morning, Uncle Ron.

1616
01:16:08,757 --> 01:16:10,224
Morning, Carla.

1617
01:16:10,259 --> 01:16:13,228
Morning, Doc.
Morning, Doug.

1618
01:16:13,262 --> 01:16:14,786
A cluster of events.

1619
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:16,661
Don't see something
for 1 0 years,

1620
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:18,996
all of a sudden,
three times in a night.

1621
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:21,829
Who got glass in their head?

1622
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:24,227
What?

1623
01:16:24,273 --> 01:16:26,138
Who got glass in their head?

1624
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:29,508
Oh, uh, Barrenger,

1625
01:16:29,545 --> 01:16:33,037
and another fellow
who works on the movie,

1626
01:16:33,081 --> 01:16:34,309
a cameraman.

1627
01:16:34,349 --> 01:16:35,646
You said three.

1628
01:16:36,685 --> 01:16:39,210
Did I?
I think you're mistaken.

1629
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,391
I wasn't in the car.

1630
01:16:46,428 --> 01:16:47,861
We'll just
see about that.

1631
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:49,693
Doug, she said
she wasn't in the car.

1632
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:52,199
Jack, it's time
to rip the band-aid off!

1633
01:16:56,104 --> 01:16:58,072
Mister,
you're going to jail.

1634
01:16:59,107 --> 01:17:01,701
I didn't know
it was illegal.

1635
01:17:01,743 --> 01:17:03,335
I beg you pardon.

1636
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:06,111
Could somebody
explain to me--

1637
01:17:06,148 --> 01:17:08,207
We've got to turn
this hotel upside down.

1638
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,649
A-ha?

1639
01:17:09,685 --> 01:17:10,845
Arrest him.

1640
01:17:10,886 --> 01:17:11,978
What's the problem?

1641
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,681
- Arrest him.
- For what?

1642
01:17:13,722 --> 01:17:15,485
Conspiracy
in statutory rape.

1643
01:17:15,524 --> 01:17:17,048
Conspiracy
in statutory rape?

1644
01:17:17,092 --> 01:17:18,650
Okay, of whom?

1645
01:17:18,694 --> 01:17:20,958
- This young woman.
- Nobody touched me.

1646
01:17:20,996 --> 01:17:22,657
- Who was it that raped you?
- Nobody.

1647
01:17:22,698 --> 01:17:24,029
Well, what's the beef?

1648
01:17:25,067 --> 01:17:27,035
She was in the car
with Bob Barrenger.

1649
01:17:27,069 --> 01:17:29,333
She was injured coming home
from a love tryst.

1650
01:17:29,371 --> 01:17:30,531
You were in the car
with Bob?

1651
01:17:30,572 --> 01:17:32,540
No.

1652
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:35,233
Then what is the--

1653
01:17:35,277 --> 01:17:37,837
Then what is this,
you son of a bitch?

1654
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,472
Because if you haven't
heard about the laws

1655
01:17:39,514 --> 01:17:41,209
of malicious prosecution,
you're about to.

1656
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,047
Don't flinch
while I'm talking to you,

1657
01:17:43,085 --> 01:17:44,609
you speed trap shaygits.

1658
01:17:44,653 --> 01:17:48,919
The kid was not in the car.
She says she wasn't in the car.

1659
01:17:48,957 --> 01:17:50,618
No one says
that she was in the car.

1660
01:17:50,659 --> 01:17:54,993
You have no case. So I'm
not playing patsy with you.

1661
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:56,793
Look me in the eyes.

1662
01:17:56,832 --> 01:18:00,393
I made 11 million bucks last year
and I don't like being trifled with.

1663
01:18:00,435 --> 01:18:03,131
Now I think the better part
of valor is for you to step away.

1664
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:05,071
Or you, your kids,
and your grandchildren

1665
01:18:05,107 --> 01:18:06,768
will die in poverty.

1666
01:18:06,808 --> 01:18:09,003
What do you think?

1667
01:18:09,044 --> 01:18:11,672
We have a movie to make.
Can we all pull together here?

1668
01:18:11,713 --> 01:18:13,112
Have a cigar.

1669
01:18:13,148 --> 01:18:14,547
There you go.

1670
01:18:18,387 --> 01:18:20,821
In a communist country
if a fellow makes an accusation

1671
01:18:20,856 --> 01:18:22,084
these are the things
that occur--

1672
01:18:22,124 --> 01:18:24,490
It's a mistake.
It's all over.

1673
01:18:24,526 --> 01:18:26,460
I'm sorry that
we've inconvenienced you.

1674
01:18:26,495 --> 01:18:27,621
I wasn't in the car.

1675
01:18:27,663 --> 01:18:29,528
We know that you weren't.
We're all aware of that.

1676
01:18:30,699 --> 01:18:33,896
Because you treat me
like a child.

1677
01:18:33,936 --> 01:18:35,494
You treat me like a child.

1678
01:18:35,537 --> 01:18:38,028
That's why I can't come.

1679
01:18:48,517 --> 01:18:49,916
Uh...

1680
01:18:49,952 --> 01:18:52,352
He took advantage of me?

1681
01:18:54,022 --> 01:18:56,183
I got to admit
I'm a bit confused.

1682
01:18:56,224 --> 01:18:57,589
I'm going
to straighten you out.

1683
01:18:57,626 --> 01:18:59,150
Officer, will you
see these folks home?

1684
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:00,354
Yes, sir.

1685
01:19:00,395 --> 01:19:02,260
She's upset
and impressionable.

1686
01:19:02,297 --> 01:19:03,924
Get me my law book
and the mayor.

1687
01:19:03,966 --> 01:19:05,934
I was talking
to that girl in there.

1688
01:19:05,968 --> 01:19:09,028
- Overcome by the events...
- I never touched her...

1689
01:19:09,071 --> 01:19:11,801
- A high powered fantasy.
- On my mother's grave.

1690
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,807
We were talking
about the script.

1691
01:19:12,841 --> 01:19:15,105
I think you might
want to get dressed.

1692
01:19:15,143 --> 01:19:16,770
I really don't
understand the problem.

1693
01:19:16,812 --> 01:19:17,779
- Wally--
- All right.

1694
01:19:17,813 --> 01:19:19,576
Carla: I want to go home.

1695
01:19:19,614 --> 01:19:21,081
If somebody
would enlighten me.

1696
01:19:21,116 --> 01:19:22,276
That's what
I'm here for.

1697
01:19:22,317 --> 01:19:23,375
Carla.

1698
01:19:25,187 --> 01:19:26,848
Adolescence is
a difficult time.

1699
01:19:26,888 --> 01:19:28,412
It is a time of dreams.

1700
01:19:28,457 --> 01:19:29,981
Many young folks
dream of Hollywood.

1701
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:30,957
I know I did.

1702
01:19:30,993 --> 01:19:33,018
And here Hollywood
has come to you.

1703
01:19:33,061 --> 01:19:35,586
She told me
she was studying Phonics.

1704
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,825
I'm going to need
her birth certificate.

1705
01:19:37,866 --> 01:19:39,834
Carla, I swear that girl
in my room--

1706
01:19:39,868 --> 01:19:41,631
Be quiet, Bob.

1707
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:43,638
It's called
a script conference.

1708
01:19:43,672 --> 01:19:45,435
You have
a fertile mind.

1709
01:19:45,474 --> 01:19:47,305
We use people like that
in our work.

1710
01:19:47,342 --> 01:19:49,367
You said you were
doing your homework!

1711
01:19:49,411 --> 01:19:51,470
Because if that's not true,
you're grounded?

1712
01:19:51,513 --> 01:19:54,346
Can we get him
home, please?

1713
01:19:54,383 --> 01:19:56,374
- I--
- I don't think so.

1714
01:19:56,418 --> 01:19:59,581
If you think I'm fooling,
wait until I get you home.

1715
01:19:59,621 --> 01:20:00,918
It occurs to me

1716
01:20:00,956 --> 01:20:02,583
that there's a part
in our movie--

1717
01:20:02,624 --> 01:20:04,251
I would appreciate it if you
wouldn't speak to the complainant.

1718
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:07,159
There's part, a young girl--
Am I right?

1719
01:20:07,195 --> 01:20:10,289
Here, statutory rape,
blah blah blah.

1720
01:20:10,332 --> 01:20:12,857
Carla, you know at the beginning
of any relationship--

1721
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:15,631
Keep him away from me
until the end of time.

1722
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:18,138
Unsupported testimony
of the complainant--

1723
01:20:18,173 --> 01:20:19,572
You travel with
the statutes on rape?

1724
01:20:19,608 --> 01:20:20,802
Carla.

1725
01:20:20,842 --> 01:20:24,175
Conflicting statements,
a coerced accusation--

1726
01:20:24,212 --> 01:20:27,045
You got a complainant
who's worthless.

1727
01:20:27,082 --> 01:20:29,414
You've got no witness
that puts her in the car,

1728
01:20:29,451 --> 01:20:30,713
and you've got no backing.

1729
01:20:30,752 --> 01:20:33,744
Yeah? Maybe we better
talk to the mayor.

1730
01:20:33,789 --> 01:20:36,121
- Hello, Mr. Mayor.
- Is that the mayor?

1731
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:39,753
- It's just an unfortunate--
- Is he cool or angry?

1732
01:20:48,503 --> 01:20:50,562
So, today we got lucky.

1733
01:20:50,605 --> 01:20:53,597
If your memory was as long as
your dick you'd be in good shape.

1734
01:20:53,642 --> 01:20:56,167
How long since you almost
went to jail for this shit?

1735
01:20:56,211 --> 01:20:58,509
How could she turn on me?
I thought she liked me.

1736
01:20:58,547 --> 01:21:01,914
Can we keep our pants buttoned
and get out of this in one piece?

1737
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:03,747
- I'm ready.
- Well, stay ready.

1738
01:21:03,785 --> 01:21:06,276
- Stay by yourself in your room.
- What am I going to do for fun?

1739
01:21:06,321 --> 01:21:08,152
Why don't you
learn your lines?

1740
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:10,215
-I know my lines.
- You do?

1741
01:21:10,258 --> 01:21:12,852
I just don't know
what order they come in.

1742
01:21:12,894 --> 01:21:14,987
I'll tell you what--

1743
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:17,123
Let's ditch these
cockamamie locals.

1744
01:21:17,165 --> 01:21:20,726
- They play too rough.
- Let's go to some roadhouse.

1745
01:21:20,769 --> 01:21:22,430
Just us.
You, me and Claire.

1746
01:21:22,471 --> 01:21:25,099
We'll drink
a bottle of wine.

1747
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:27,608
- Now you're talking.
- Just get in the car and go.

1748
01:21:27,642 --> 01:21:30,406
Yeah,
someplace real.

1749
01:21:30,445 --> 01:21:31,742
You and me, pal.

1750
01:21:34,349 --> 01:21:35,646
What are you
doing for fun?

1751
01:21:35,684 --> 01:21:37,709
I went for a ride
on a tractor.

1752
01:21:37,752 --> 01:21:39,583
- Get out.
- Nope.

1753
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:41,646
You went for a ride
on a tractor?

1754
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:43,715
Yup, last night.

1755
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:58,136
Hey, Molly, will you
get me a ham sandwich?

1756
01:22:26,835 --> 01:22:28,735
Hey, you got
to eat a pack of dirt.

1757
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,601
My wife just went
into labor.

1758
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,698
Half a buck
I'd close it down.

1759
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:35,107
It's perfidy.

1760
01:22:35,143 --> 01:22:37,304
You got Barrenger
molesting little girls.

1761
01:22:37,345 --> 01:22:39,506
- He should be put in jail.
- I'd put him in jail.

1762
01:22:39,548 --> 01:22:41,573
- You should.
- If I had a witness I would.

1763
01:22:41,616 --> 01:22:42,981
A witness to what?

1764
01:22:43,018 --> 01:22:45,816
To the rape.
Even to the accident.

1765
01:22:45,854 --> 01:22:47,048
You mean with White?

1766
01:22:47,088 --> 01:22:48,487
What?

1767
01:22:48,523 --> 01:22:50,650
You mean you need a witness
in addition to White?

1768
01:22:50,692 --> 01:22:52,455
- Who's White?
- The writer.

1769
01:22:52,494 --> 01:22:54,894
- He saw the accident?
- Sure.

1770
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:56,397
He saw the girl
in the car?

1771
01:22:56,431 --> 01:22:58,331
You bet he did.

1772
01:23:08,176 --> 01:23:10,804
Well, that's
what I'm talking about.

1773
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:39,773
Don't you touch that.

1774
01:23:56,258 --> 01:23:57,555
Excuse me.

1775
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:05,295
- I want them gone.
- I signed the permit.

1776
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:08,131
- I want them thrown in jail.
- Sherry. Sherry.

1777
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,798
I want them to starve
in a great big hole

1778
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,035
and I'm going to
go there and piss on them.

1779
01:24:14,075 --> 01:24:15,565
What?

1780
01:24:19,481 --> 01:24:21,506
Get me the state police.

1781
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:27,547
The sleepy little town
of Waterford, Vermont,

1782
01:24:27,589 --> 01:24:29,580
where movie star,
Bob Barrenger,

1783
01:24:29,624 --> 01:24:32,252
fresh with his troubles
with the law last year,

1784
01:24:32,294 --> 01:24:34,489
is once again
in hot water,

1785
01:24:34,529 --> 01:24:36,963
involved in a car crash
with a young,

1786
01:24:36,998 --> 01:24:38,693
a very young, woman.

1787
01:24:38,733 --> 01:24:41,293
Mr. Barrenger is being
arraigned today

1788
01:24:41,336 --> 01:24:44,169
for moral turpitude
and several other--

1789
01:24:44,205 --> 01:24:45,968
Make sure you
got your facts straight.

1790
01:24:46,007 --> 01:24:48,703
You step off the line
and I'm gonna sue you personally.

1791
01:24:48,743 --> 01:24:50,836
Bobby!

1792
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:52,972
Good morning, where are you
taking Mr. Barrenger?

1793
01:24:53,014 --> 01:24:55,676
We're looking for
a Mr. Joseph Turner White.

1794
01:24:55,717 --> 01:24:57,184
- What are you doing?
- He's under arrest.

1795
01:24:57,218 --> 01:25:00,119
I'm his lawyer.
And you must be Perry Mason.

1796
01:25:00,155 --> 01:25:01,122
Guess what?

1797
01:25:01,156 --> 01:25:03,716
You are one half step
from a world of hurt.

1798
01:25:03,758 --> 01:25:06,124
How diverting? The mayor's
going to have your ass.

1799
01:25:06,161 --> 01:25:07,719
- Can I watch?
- You guess what?

1800
01:25:07,762 --> 01:25:08,729
The mayor sent me.

1801
01:25:08,763 --> 01:25:10,754
I have your Mr. Barrenger
with a history--

1802
01:25:10,799 --> 01:25:12,357
A history of nothing.
He was acquitted.

1803
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,163
Moral turpitude.
What are you waiting for?

1804
01:25:14,202 --> 01:25:16,466
- Don't say anything.
- Nothing happened.

1805
01:25:17,238 --> 01:25:20,867
You're on my home court. I got
the mayor and the town behind me.

1806
01:25:20,909 --> 01:25:22,376
And forget making
your movie.

1807
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:24,537
I may own the studio
when I get through.

1808
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:26,706
I got a civil suit.
I got rape. I got collusion.

1809
01:25:26,748 --> 01:25:28,147
You got nothing.
You don't have a witness?

1810
01:25:28,183 --> 01:25:30,743
And I have a witness?
Your Mr. White saw the crime.

1811
01:25:30,785 --> 01:25:32,480
- He told you that?
- He didn't have to.

1812
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,953
I need to talk to him.
Will you excuse me?

1813
01:25:33,988 --> 01:25:34,977
Oh, you're
his attorney, too?

1814
01:25:35,023 --> 01:25:36,718
- Later for you, pal.
- Okay.

1815
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:40,157
Marty!

1816
01:25:40,195 --> 01:25:42,095
Bob's in the slammer.
You do that, I'll do this.

1817
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:43,154
What are you
going to do?

1818
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:44,597
Go be with him.

1819
01:25:44,632 --> 01:25:46,759
- Hey, Marty.
- Hi, pal.

1820
01:25:46,801 --> 01:25:49,326
I need to talk to you.

1821
01:26:07,956 --> 01:26:10,652
Okay.

1822
01:26:10,692 --> 01:26:12,489
He's going to give you
a couple of minutes.

1823
01:26:13,928 --> 01:26:15,486
What's it all about?

1824
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,895
I saw the accident.

1825
01:26:16,931 --> 01:26:18,421
How do they know that?
You told them?

1826
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:20,366
- No.
- What did you say to them?

1827
01:26:20,402 --> 01:26:21,835
I didn't say anything
to them.

1828
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:24,202
Good.
Come here.

1829
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,399
That's very good.

1830
01:26:28,143 --> 01:26:29,110
Have a seat.

1831
01:26:30,979 --> 01:26:33,243
How do you know
you saw it?

1832
01:26:33,281 --> 01:26:36,079
- I don't understand.
- Perhaps you didn't see it.

1833
01:26:37,519 --> 01:26:38,918
Perhaps you didn't
see it.

1834
01:26:38,953 --> 01:26:40,545
I saw it.
I was there.

1835
01:26:40,588 --> 01:26:43,056
You were there...

1836
01:26:43,091 --> 01:26:44,388
at 1 0:35?

1837
01:26:46,461 --> 01:26:48,326
Yeah, I was walking
down the street

1838
01:26:48,363 --> 01:26:52,459
and I remember...
I was writing--

1839
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,899
What glasses
were you wearing?

1840
01:26:53,935 --> 01:26:55,493
Were you wearing
your reading glasses?

1841
01:26:56,771 --> 01:26:57,965
I--

1842
01:26:58,006 --> 01:26:59,200
You told me
you were writing.

1843
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,798
Don't you wear your reading
glasses to write?

1844
01:27:00,842 --> 01:27:02,070
Isn't that
what you told me?

1845
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:03,407
Hold on.

1846
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:06,547
Yeah?

1847
01:27:07,782 --> 01:27:08,771
Yeah.

1848
01:27:10,084 --> 01:27:12,314
I've got to go
to the jail.

1849
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:13,320
Be strong.

1850
01:27:20,628 --> 01:27:22,687
What am I gonna do?

1851
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:25,028
You gotta tell them you saw
the accident, don't you?

1852
01:27:25,066 --> 01:27:27,034
I can't do that.

1853
01:27:27,068 --> 01:27:30,094
If I tell them,
they'll try Bob for rape

1854
01:27:30,138 --> 01:27:31,833
and it will
ruin his career.

1855
01:27:31,873 --> 01:27:33,500
But that's what happened.

1856
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:35,065
But they'll stop the movie.

1857
01:27:35,109 --> 01:27:37,600
Maybe there'll be
other movies.

1858
01:27:37,645 --> 01:27:39,112
They'll blackball me.

1859
01:27:40,281 --> 01:27:42,613
Carla was in the car.

1860
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:44,242
What am I gonna do?

1861
01:27:53,428 --> 01:27:54,759
A lot of hubbub
in the street.

1862
01:27:54,796 --> 01:27:56,593
I'm taking you
the back way.

1863
01:28:04,539 --> 01:28:06,200
Two minutes?

1864
01:28:06,241 --> 01:28:08,266
Let's speak English.
You gotta help the side.

1865
01:28:08,309 --> 01:28:09,367
You want me to lie?

1866
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,571
To the contrary,
I want you to tell the truth.

1867
01:28:11,613 --> 01:28:14,514
Truth is you can't tell me
that you saw the thing.

1868
01:28:14,549 --> 01:28:17,643
You don't remember
which glasses you've got on.

1869
01:28:17,685 --> 01:28:21,587
If you're not sure, then they've
got nothing and Bob walks free.

1870
01:28:21,623 --> 01:28:24,183
This is a damn roust
and everybody knows it.

1871
01:28:24,225 --> 01:28:27,353
The guy wants to
make a name for himself.

1872
01:28:27,395 --> 01:28:30,626
If we let him do that, then
we're being false to our community.

1873
01:28:30,665 --> 01:28:32,155
Do you understand?
To our world.

1874
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,225
And you're a part
of that world.

1875
01:28:34,269 --> 01:28:36,260
I got a five picture deal
with the studio.

1876
01:28:36,304 --> 01:28:37,999
You stick with me,
you write one, two more--

1877
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:40,803
You stick with me,
you'll direct the next one.

1878
01:28:40,842 --> 01:28:42,503
The girl wasn't
in the car.

1879
01:28:42,544 --> 01:28:44,273
You got to go.

1880
01:29:33,494 --> 01:29:35,962
Joseph Turner White.

1881
01:29:48,776 --> 01:29:50,141
Hear ye, hear ye.

1882
01:29:50,178 --> 01:29:52,442
Sixth District Court
in for the county of Codona,

1883
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,038
State of Vermont.

1884
01:29:54,082 --> 01:29:56,642
The Honorable James Addison
Flynn presiding.

1885
01:29:56,684 --> 01:29:59,653
All those with business before
this honorable court draw near

1886
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:01,348
you will be heard.

1887
01:30:02,423 --> 01:30:05,483
Mr. White, this is
a simple matter of--

1888
01:30:07,929 --> 01:30:10,420
All we need is a simple
fact or two.

1889
01:30:11,566 --> 01:30:13,500
You're going to give your
recollections of the accident

1890
01:30:13,534 --> 01:30:15,001
at the corner
of State and Main.

1891
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:16,901
Would you please
swear him in?

1892
01:30:16,938 --> 01:30:19,031
Raise your right hand.

1893
01:30:21,576 --> 01:30:23,168
Do you swear
to tell the truth,

1894
01:30:23,211 --> 01:30:25,304
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

1895
01:30:25,346 --> 01:30:26,643
so help you God?

1896
01:30:29,384 --> 01:30:30,646
I do.

1897
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:34,487
The arraignment, as we said,
of Bob Barrenger.

1898
01:30:34,522 --> 01:30:36,717
The Bob Barrenger,
star of The Old Mill

1899
01:30:36,758 --> 01:30:39,693
about to begin shooting here
in picturesque and sleepy--

1900
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:42,560
or we should say,
formerly sleepy--

1901
01:30:42,597 --> 01:30:45,794
Yes, yes...

1902
01:30:45,833 --> 01:30:47,767
Yes, it's Claire Wellesley.

1903
01:30:47,802 --> 01:30:49,201
We're going to try
to get a look at her.

1904
01:30:49,237 --> 01:30:51,797
Let's go.
Stay with me.

1905
01:31:14,162 --> 01:31:15,322
Morning, Doc.

1906
01:31:15,363 --> 01:31:17,695
Morning, Billy.
Where are you headed?

1907
01:31:17,732 --> 01:31:19,165
Down to the corner
to see the ruckus.

1908
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:22,067
Watch the curbs now.

1909
01:31:22,103 --> 01:31:23,092
Good morning.

1910
01:31:25,073 --> 01:31:27,064
Where are you off to?

1911
01:31:27,108 --> 01:31:28,075
Uh...

1912
01:31:29,711 --> 01:31:31,144
I'm leaving.

1913
01:31:31,179 --> 01:31:32,271
Why?

1914
01:31:33,314 --> 01:31:35,680
I perjured myself.

1915
01:31:36,918 --> 01:31:41,014
I told a lie,
and I ruined my life.

1916
01:31:41,055 --> 01:31:42,613
That's what I did.

1917
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:46,787
I don't suppose you could
help me with that, could you?

1918
01:31:47,995 --> 01:31:50,589
Turn back the clock
or something?

1919
01:31:51,833 --> 01:31:53,960
You know,
to give me back my...

1920
01:31:55,403 --> 01:31:57,268
give me back
my purity?

1921
01:31:57,305 --> 01:31:59,739
I don't suppose you could wave your
magic wand

1922
01:31:59,774 --> 01:32:00,968
and do that, could you?

1923
01:32:02,543 --> 01:32:04,875
For what is truth?

1924
01:32:06,514 --> 01:32:09,677
Isn't that the thing,
what is true?

1925
01:32:09,717 --> 01:32:11,412
The truth is
you never should trust

1926
01:32:11,452 --> 01:32:13,147
anybody who wears a bow tie.

1927
01:32:13,187 --> 01:32:14,814
Here.

1928
01:32:16,324 --> 01:32:18,383
A cravat is supposed
to point down,

1929
01:32:18,426 --> 01:32:20,656
to accentuate
the genitals.

1930
01:32:20,695 --> 01:32:22,060
Why do you want
to trust somebody

1931
01:32:22,096 --> 01:32:25,463
whose tie points out
to accentuate his ears?

1932
01:32:28,302 --> 01:32:31,499
Aren't you supposed to set
an example for people?

1933
01:32:31,539 --> 01:32:32,904
Nope.

1934
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:35,340
Just supposed to hold
their hands while they die.

1935
01:32:37,678 --> 01:32:39,509
What did you say
your problem was?

1936
01:32:39,547 --> 01:32:41,447
- Hi, Doc.
- Oh, morning, Chrissy.

1937
01:32:41,482 --> 01:32:43,109
How's the back?

1938
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:02,333
I ruined my life.

1939
01:33:04,772 --> 01:33:07,468
Isn't that funny
you can actually do it

1940
01:33:07,508 --> 01:33:09,703
in one moment,
just like they say?

1941
01:33:11,012 --> 01:33:13,242
I ruined my life
back in that courthouse.

1942
01:33:14,415 --> 01:33:16,781
- What courthouse?
- The courthouse back in town.

1943
01:33:16,818 --> 01:33:18,410
The town ain't got
no courthouse.

1944
01:33:18,452 --> 01:33:19,749
What?

1945
01:33:19,787 --> 01:33:21,254
It ain't got
no courthouse.

1946
01:33:21,289 --> 01:33:23,883
Courthouse burned
down in 1 960.

1947
01:33:23,925 --> 01:33:25,893
Where do they hold court?

1948
01:33:25,927 --> 01:33:28,862
To hold court they have to--
science lab

1949
01:33:28,896 --> 01:33:30,227
at the high school.

1950
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,335
Morning, Judge,
what brings you down here?

1951
01:33:35,369 --> 01:33:37,599
Supposed to be hearing
some deposition.

1952
01:33:37,638 --> 01:33:40,004
Some fool saw the accident
the other night.

1953
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:41,167
Did the courthouse
burn down?

1954
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:43,643
Courthouse burned
down 1 960.

1955
01:33:43,678 --> 01:33:45,771
Part of a spate of fires--

1956
01:33:45,813 --> 01:33:47,644
old mill, courthouse--

1957
01:33:47,682 --> 01:33:50,549
Supposed to have been set
by some deranged teenager.

1958
01:33:50,585 --> 01:33:53,748
Gave rise to
the Waterford Huskies.

1959
01:35:09,263 --> 01:35:11,527
I thought you needed
to get it out of your system.

1960
01:35:14,502 --> 01:35:16,470
The American system
of jurisprudence,

1961
01:35:16,504 --> 01:35:18,529
which differs from ours
in the following respects:

1962
01:35:18,572 --> 01:35:19,903
They have their
Bill of Rights,

1963
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:22,409
equal perhaps
to our Magna Carta.

1964
01:35:24,345 --> 01:35:25,471
What are you
gonna do?

1965
01:35:25,513 --> 01:35:26,912
Tell the truth.

1966
01:35:39,593 --> 01:35:41,993
I would now like
to address you

1967
01:35:42,029 --> 01:35:45,226
on the responsibility
of the prosecutor's office.

1968
01:35:45,266 --> 01:35:47,496
The job is not
always a happy one,

1969
01:35:47,535 --> 01:35:49,162
but there comes
a time now and then

1970
01:35:49,203 --> 01:35:52,070
in the life of the community
for the display of force.

1971
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:54,807
So be it.

1972
01:35:54,842 --> 01:35:58,073
Now it falls to my lot
to join the fray,

1973
01:35:58,112 --> 01:36:00,307
to join in battle
and to exterminate

1974
01:36:00,348 --> 01:36:02,179
by means of this
criminal indictment,

1975
01:36:02,216 --> 01:36:04,309
to exterminate
the vermin...

1976
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:06,286
He's got toilet
paper on his face

1977
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,254
and he's sweating
like a pig.

1978
01:36:08,289 --> 01:36:10,951
...a license granted him
by a gracious nation,

1979
01:36:11,158 --> 01:36:13,422
who spew filth
and degradation

1980
01:36:13,461 --> 01:36:14,894
and who--

1981
01:36:16,464 --> 01:36:19,024
Damnit.
Who pollute the minds--

1982
01:36:19,066 --> 01:36:21,694
We're live in five minutes.
Do you need to clean up?

1983
01:36:21,736 --> 01:36:23,135
Yes, thank you.

1984
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:27,939
Do something.

1985
01:36:27,975 --> 01:36:30,034
You tell me what to do.
I'll do it.

1986
01:36:30,077 --> 01:36:34,036
I was just paying off
my spread in Montana.

1987
01:36:37,284 --> 01:36:39,149
Excuse me, sorry.

1988
01:36:39,186 --> 01:36:40,744
I'm here to give
my deposition.

1989
01:36:40,788 --> 01:36:42,346
Joe?

1990
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:44,221
Thank God.
It's up to you, pal.

1991
01:36:44,258 --> 01:36:46,317
- I'm out.
- I don't get you.

1992
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:48,294
The girl was
in the car.

1993
01:36:48,329 --> 01:36:50,297
I treated you like a son,
or a nephew--

1994
01:36:50,331 --> 01:36:51,696
It's not about you--

1995
01:36:51,732 --> 01:36:52,960
No, what's it
about then?

1996
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,968
I have to tell
the truth.

1997
01:36:55,002 --> 01:36:57,027
That is just so narrow.

1998
01:36:57,071 --> 01:36:58,936
The girl was in the car.

1999
01:36:58,973 --> 01:36:59,940
Then you're finished
in showbiz.

2000
01:36:59,974 --> 01:37:01,066
So be it.

2001
01:37:01,108 --> 01:37:02,405
And we're going to sue you
for a billion dollars.

2002
01:37:02,443 --> 01:37:03,842
What cause?

2003
01:37:03,878 --> 01:37:05,869
I don't need a cause.

2004
01:37:05,913 --> 01:37:07,574
I just need a lawyer!

2005
01:37:07,615 --> 01:37:08,980
I'm a lawyer.

2006
01:37:09,016 --> 01:37:10,574
- Howie?
- Yeah.

2007
01:37:10,618 --> 01:37:12,677
Howie, what are you
doing here?

2008
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,449
What am I doing here?

2009
01:37:14,488 --> 01:37:17,082
I just flew seven hours
because you asked me here.

2010
01:37:17,124 --> 01:37:18,216
What for?

2011
01:37:18,259 --> 01:37:19,920
For this, and I hope
you need it,

2012
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:21,655
because it's coming
out of your budget.

2013
01:37:36,243 --> 01:37:37,335
Hi.

2014
01:37:37,378 --> 01:37:40,779
I would prefer it
if you didn't speak to me.

2015
01:37:40,815 --> 01:37:43,181
You know,

2016
01:37:43,217 --> 01:37:44,275
there's nothing
you could say

2017
01:37:44,318 --> 01:37:46,081
that could possibly
make a difference.

2018
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:47,849
So why don't you
just save your breath?

2019
01:37:47,888 --> 01:37:49,981
Okay.

2020
01:37:52,226 --> 01:37:53,716
You forgot your case.

2021
01:37:55,930 --> 01:37:58,728
That's not my case.
That's your case.

2022
01:37:58,766 --> 01:38:00,961
Oh, it's mine?
What did I put in it?

2023
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:03,094
$800,000 in cash.

2024
01:38:04,738 --> 01:38:06,729
And what was it
you wanted to say?

2025
01:38:06,774 --> 01:38:08,708
Good yuntiff.

2026
01:38:12,379 --> 01:38:13,346
Officer.

2027
01:38:14,515 --> 01:38:16,107
I'm supposed to give
my deposition.

2028
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:18,380
The judge will be
with you in a minute.

2029
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:24,617
I'm going to have
to go to jail.

2030
01:38:24,658 --> 01:38:26,125
I'll knit you a sweater.

2031
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:28,219
I might be in there
a long time.

2032
01:38:28,262 --> 01:38:30,127
I'll knit you
a jump suit.

2033
01:38:30,164 --> 01:38:31,791
Well, okay.
Okay, then.

2034
01:38:33,701 --> 01:38:35,896
I've come to
give myself up.

2035
01:38:36,437 --> 01:38:37,768
Hi, Annie.

2036
01:38:37,805 --> 01:38:39,204
Hi, Judge.

2037
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:41,967
Good to see you, girl.

2038
01:38:42,009 --> 01:38:43,374
I've come to
give myself up.

2039
01:38:44,445 --> 01:38:47,778
You're going to have to
give yourself up to someone else.

2040
01:38:47,815 --> 01:38:50,750
I'm going to
get in some golf.

2041
01:38:53,721 --> 01:38:57,418
Why don't you
give yourself up to her?

2042
01:38:57,458 --> 01:38:59,619
That's what I'd do
if I were you.

2043
01:39:06,133 --> 01:39:09,125
I have learned a lesson
and the lesson is this:

2044
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:11,536
That everybody needs
a second chance.

2045
01:39:13,407 --> 01:39:16,570
You, me and these
fine film people here.

2046
01:39:17,645 --> 01:39:20,443
You know, they have
a high profile

2047
01:39:20,481 --> 01:39:23,678
but that doesn't mean they
aren't deserving of our trust

2048
01:39:23,717 --> 01:39:25,480
and of our respect.

2049
01:39:25,519 --> 01:39:28,317
I think there's
a lesson here.

2050
01:39:28,355 --> 01:39:30,255
The lesson is this:

2051
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:32,691
It is a lesson
of tolerance.

2052
01:39:32,726 --> 01:39:35,217
And as we look
at this industry--

2053
01:39:35,262 --> 01:39:36,456
Ssh...

2054
01:39:36,497 --> 01:39:40,331
As we look at this clean,
American industry,

2055
01:39:40,367 --> 01:39:43,803
and as I begin
my campaign for congress

2056
01:39:43,837 --> 01:39:47,068
in my aspiration toward
that city on a hill,

2057
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:49,473
I would
like to say this...

2058
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:55,744
This is picture?
This is picture?

2059
01:39:58,018 --> 01:39:59,815
- Roll camera.
- Speed.

2060
01:39:59,853 --> 01:40:02,048
The Fires of Home,
scene one, take one.

2061
01:40:04,925 --> 01:40:06,222
Action?

2062
01:40:08,696 --> 01:40:10,687
Hold still now.

2063
01:40:13,767 --> 01:40:16,827
I guess that fire got a little
bit exciting last night, eh, Frank?

2064
01:40:18,372 --> 01:40:20,806
Doc, that's their nature.

2065
01:40:20,841 --> 01:40:22,001
If you didn't have
a little excitement

2066
01:40:22,042 --> 01:40:23,066
wouldn't life be dull?

2067
01:40:23,110 --> 01:40:25,544
That it would.

2068
01:40:25,579 --> 01:40:27,740
What do I owe you?

2069
01:40:27,781 --> 01:40:29,976
You quit your kidding.

2070
01:40:30,017 --> 01:40:32,577
Hey, Nate, see what
you can do with this.

2071
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:35,953
Ha ha, fix it up
good as new, Frank.

2072
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:37,252
Morning, Sister.

2073
01:40:45,165 --> 01:40:47,065
We missed you
in church today.

2074
01:40:47,101 --> 01:40:49,467
Sister, I've just
come from a fire.

2075
01:40:49,503 --> 01:40:52,768
That is an explanation,
but it's no excuse.

2076
01:40:59,313 --> 01:41:01,213
Let me help you with that.

2077
01:41:03,517 --> 01:41:06,418
Sister, I didn't come here
to talk about the altitude.

2078
01:41:06,453 --> 01:41:08,387
What did you want
to tell me about?

2079
01:41:08,422 --> 01:41:11,016
Let's talk about something
a man could get his hands on.

2080
01:41:11,058 --> 01:41:13,424
That's exactly why
I want to talk to you.

2081
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:15,360
I wish you had been
in church today.

2082
01:41:15,396 --> 01:41:16,954
What would I have seen?

2083
01:41:16,997 --> 01:41:19,522
You would have seen
Father Mulcahy,

2084
01:41:19,566 --> 01:41:22,194
that kind, dear old man.

2085
01:41:22,236 --> 01:41:23,430
I heard he was ill.

2086
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:25,631
He is ill, and you
would have seen him

2087
01:41:25,673 --> 01:41:28,107
rise from his bed
and hobble to church

2088
01:41:28,142 --> 01:41:30,508
and talk about
redemption.

2089
01:41:30,544 --> 01:41:33,980
If he had been
talking to me...

2090
01:41:34,014 --> 01:41:36,505
Just as bad. I have
no chance of redemption.

2091
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:39,610
Redemption is not offered
once, Frank, but continually.

2092
01:41:39,653 --> 01:41:40,915
Kind words, Sister.

2093
01:41:40,954 --> 01:41:42,979
They are not mine.

2094
01:41:43,023 --> 01:41:44,547
And you come by
next Sunday,

2095
01:41:44,591 --> 01:41:46,320
we'll give you
a second chance.

2096
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,123
Sister, the only
second chance I know

2097
01:41:48,162 --> 01:41:50,630
is the chance to make
the same mistake twice.

2098
01:41:53,467 --> 01:41:54,957
Cut!
That's a cut.

2099
01:41:55,002 --> 01:41:56,264
Bob, this is great!

2100
01:42:00,341 --> 01:42:02,332
We've got to talk
about this thing.

2101
01:42:02,376 --> 01:42:03,866
Joe. Joe?

2102
01:42:03,911 --> 01:42:05,640
I want to change this.

2103
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:10,480
We are going again.
We are going again?

2104
01:42:11,518 --> 01:42:12,485
Good work, Bob.

2105
01:42:12,519 --> 01:42:14,248
Stand by.

2106
01:42:14,288 --> 01:42:15,915
Cue the dead horse.

2107
01:42:15,956 --> 01:42:18,356
And can we get a crate
of doughnuts for the teamsters?

2108
01:42:18,392 --> 01:42:19,882
Well, it beats working.

2109
01:44:14,708 --> 01:44:17,609
Man #1 : Would you care
to identify that song for us?

2110
01:44:17,644 --> 01:44:19,236
Man #2: The song is called--

2111
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:21,713
well, the original title,
which we can't use any more

2112
01:44:21,748 --> 01:44:24,114
is called
The Song of the Old Mill.

2113
01:44:24,151 --> 01:44:26,381
We can't use that title
because that's no longer

2114
01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:27,284
the name of the movie.

2115
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:29,050
Man #1 : The movie
now is called--

2116
01:44:29,089 --> 01:44:30,886
Man #2: The movie is now
called The Fires of Home.

2117
01:44:30,924 --> 01:44:33,722
Man #1 : The Fires of Home,
and this movie is about...?

2118
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:38,322
Man #2: Well, it's about
many, many things.

2119
01:44:38,365 --> 01:44:42,392
Which I think is a character
of any great movie.

2120
01:44:42,436 --> 01:44:45,166
It means many different
things to many people.

2121
01:44:45,205 --> 01:44:46,763
Or three things
to three guys.

2122
01:44:46,807 --> 01:44:48,172
Man #1 : Let's go
the phones.

2123
01:44:48,208 --> 01:44:51,473
Maurice is on the line
from Medicine Hat, Alberta.

2124
01:45:31,718 --> 01:45:34,152
Man: Once more, and can you
try to play the notes this time?
