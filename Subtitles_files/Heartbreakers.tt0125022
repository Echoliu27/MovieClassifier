1
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,405
Do you, Angela Nardino...

2
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,783
take Dean Cumanno as your
lawfully wedded husband...

3
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,704
to love, honor, and obey
till death do you part?

4
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,747
I do.

5
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:08,253
Out of the tree of life,
I just picked me a plum

6
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:16,803
You came along,
and everything started to hum

7
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,019
You happy, Baby?

8
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,939
I am so happy.
It's beautiful, Dean.

9
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,524
It's everything
I ever wanted.

10
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,067
Yeah?

11
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,320
Like the song says,
"The best is yet to come."

12
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,323
The honeymoon.

13
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:40,494
Oh, you got a little
bit of cake right...

14
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,461
I think we've put in enough of
an appearance here, don't you?

15
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,838
Come on, let's go.

16
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,466
I believe it's tradition
for the best man to dance...

17
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,759
with the beautiful bride.

18
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,760
Piss off, Leo.

19
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,805
Dean, you can't be
rude to your friends.

20
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,807
I'd love to dance with you.

21
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:09,398
The best is yet to come,
come the day you're mine

22
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:15,654
Come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away

23
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,701
Just say the words,
and we'll beat the birds

24
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:25,080
Down to Acapulco Bay

25
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:30,210
It's perfect for
a flying honeymoon

26
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:37,217
They say, come fly with me,
let's fly, let's fly away

27
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,345
Congratulations, man.
She's great.

28
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,763
I love your friends.

29
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,308
That's the busboy, honey.

30
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,767
Wow.

31
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,645
You even got me great busboys.

32
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:52,191
Now let's have one more
dance with the bride and groom.

33
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,276
Oh! Ha ha ha!

34
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,739
Are you still nervous?

35
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,907
No.

36
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,785
And thank you for respecting
my religious beliefs.

37
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,581
-I'm really ready now.
-Thank you, God!

38
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,957
I'm ready to do things to you...

39
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,960
that no woman has
ever done before.

40
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,504
How about a...

41
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,960
Oh.

42
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,961
Here it is.

43
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,129
Oh, it's so...

44
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,173
tasteful.

45
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,684
Oh, my God.

46
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:54,313
That's how much
I love you, baby.

47
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,523
You must love me...

48
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,566
a lot.

49
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,957
Take me, Dean.

50
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,005
Don't tease me.

51
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,049
I'm not...

52
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:28,138
Not a big fan
of this material.

53
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,890
Oh.

54
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,430
Angela?

55
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,601
Angela!

56
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,520
Oh, no.

57
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,272
Don't do this to me, Angela.

58
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,482
Welcome back.

59
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,030
Oh, my God.

60
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,073
What happened?

61
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,159
Not a whole hell of a lot.

62
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,120
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

63
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,288
Our wedding night?

64
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, I am a bad wife.

65
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,043
No.

66
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,712
No, no, no.

67
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,757
I do got some frostbite
in some very weird places.

68
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,091
Oh--

69
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:32,137
You've got your whole
life to make it up to me.

70
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,723
And I'm going
to start right now.

71
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,642
Yeah? OK.

72
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,395
Oh!

73
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,481
Ohhh!

74
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,150
Oh, my God,
I'm going to be sick.

75
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,533
Just give me a minute, baby.
I'll be right back.

76
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,493
No, no, no.
There's no rush.

77
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,494
No rush.

78
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,371
Look, I got to stop
by the office...

79
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,414
before we leave
for Barbados any way.

80
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,000
That'll give you some
time to freshen up.

81
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,794
Let me give you
a quick kiss good-bye.

82
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,921
No! No, no, no.
That's OK, that's OK.

83
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,297
I--I'm late.

84
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,050
I'll see you in
an hour, maybe two.

85
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,938
Here. Put it
over here on the rack.

86
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:43,458
Hey! What the--?

87
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,961
-Nice security.
-Sorry, boss.

88
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,047
I--I went to bed
late last night.

89
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,924
But nothing
compared to you, huh?

90
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,634
Yeah. Is the Mercedes ready?

91
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,595
Yeah, yeah, just about.

92
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,972
We switched the VIN,
and Wendy's making...

93
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,724
the pink slip for
you to sign up there.

94
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,725
All right.

95
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,894
That's a great
wedding present, boss.

96
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,771
Angela's going to go
nuts for it, huh?

97
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,107
Maybe not as nuts as
she went last night, huh?

98
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,108
Huh?

99
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,776
Hey, boss, was
she worth the wait?

100
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:10,777
Come on--

101
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,820
Hey, hey, hey!

102
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,781
We're talking
about my wife here.

103
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:18,493
A man's wedding night is his
own private, sacred business.

104
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,580
It's not to entertain
lowlife scum like youse guys.

105
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,586
Angela's got
to be an animal.

106
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,421
Hey, he's even
walking funny, huh?

107
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,257
Hey, back to work, all right.

108
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,718
The break is over,
guys, come on.

109
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,271
Oh! Congratulations, Mr. C.

110
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,151
I heard the wedding
was awesome.

111
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,654
I'm almost through with
the docs on the Mercedes.

112
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,155
Oh, thanks, Wendy.

113
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,789
Oh, boy.

114
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:04,832
Oh, boy.

115
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,261
You need to sign
here and I think...

116
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,180
here.

117
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,685
Is it hard?

118
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,727
What?

119
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,854
Getting married.

120
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,230
I mean, I haven't
been here that long...

121
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,481
but I've already
heard tons of stories...

122
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,524
about you and women.

123
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:31,525
Yeah, well.

124
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,610
Those days are all over, Wendy.

125
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,029
Forever.

126
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,448
Thank you.

127
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,412
Ah, damn it.

128
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,045
Here. Let me help you.

129
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,558
Mr. Cumanno.

130
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,559
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Wendy.

131
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,396
I--I'm so sorry,
I'm just nuts today.

132
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,527
I can't,
I can't, I can't.

133
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:16,528
I'm married, Wendy...

134
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,529
I'm married.
I can't.

135
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,906
You're right.
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:19,907
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,076
Screw it.

138
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:38,091
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. OK, OK.

139
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:39,092
Oh, my God.

140
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,093
Thanks.

141
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,094
Is that frostbite?

142
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,138
I'm fine. It's fine.

143
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,389
Piss off,
I'm working here.

144
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,807
Baby, it's me.

145
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,728
Shit. Get out.
Take the back stairs.

146
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,313
I can't.
My hair is stuck.

147
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,356
What?

148
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,442
-Dean.
-Honey.

149
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:59,196
Ahh, ha, hi.

150
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,531
I was feeling
so much better...

151
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,532
I couldn't
wait to pick up...

152
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,950
where we left off.

153
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,034
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

154
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,035
You know what?

155
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,620
I'm just going
to finish up here.

156
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,831
I'll meet you outside
in a sex--a sec.

157
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,332
OK.

158
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,333
I love you.

159
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,585
Oh.

160
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,212
I love you, too.

161
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,423
You look pretty.

162
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:22,928
Come on.

163
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,012
Come on. Ow.

164
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,305
Get out.
Not so fast.

165
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,306
You are not
welcome down there.

166
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,391
Get up.
I'm trying.

167
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,310
I can't
believe that Mercedes...

168
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,690
Dean.

169
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,275
Honey, honey, this
isn't what it looks like.

170
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,443
I--I swear her hair
got stuck in my zipper.

171
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,320
I--I--I wasn't getting nothing.

172
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,448
17 hours we have
been married.

173
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,325
17 hours!

174
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,411
The happiest
17 hours of my life.

175
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,664
You just lost the best
thing you'd ever had.

176
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,293
Angela, wait.

177
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,173
She seems...

178
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,215
nice.

179
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,052
My client has agreed,
against my advice...

180
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,598
to settle for
a one-time cash payment.

181
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,688
$300,000.

182
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,523
For one day?

183
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:20,360
One horribly traumatic day
in which my client suffered...

184
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:24,031
irreparable psychological
damage to her self-esteem.

185
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,533
Oh, and she keeps
the Mercedes.

186
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,993
What?

187
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,370
Bullshit.

188
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,456
Well, we could drag this
before a judge...

189
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,417
if you think that
would be more favorable.

190
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,129
That would put your client's
business under scrutiny.

191
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,089
What was it again, Mr. Cumanno?

192
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,966
Random repossessions?

193
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,722
Give her what she wants.

194
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,731
I can't believe you
wore the grey dress.

195
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,358
I distinctly said the blue.

196
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,069
-It worked, didn't it?
-You were lucky.

197
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,904
I was good.

198
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,459
Excuse me.

199
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,629
I wonder if I could ask
your help for a moment.

200
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,675
I'm trying to find Route 40.

201
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,677
Route 40?
Well, you're on it.

202
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,012
That's it.

203
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,180
What?
Where is it?

204
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,514
There. See that black thing...

205
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,141
with the lines on it,
the cars going?

206
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,309
I'm so embarrassed.

207
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,560
I'm so sorry.

208
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,353
I didn't know
where it was.

209
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,354
Thank you so much.

210
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,355
My pleasure.

211
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,356
Sorry to trouble you.

212
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,399
It's OK.

213
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,405
Forget it.

214
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:29,531
You're not going
to kill yourself...

215
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,491
and stink up my new car.

216
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,784
Our new car.

217
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:35,996
Hey! Mom.

218
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,624
I only do these things
because I love you, Page.

219
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,504
How was the wedding?

220
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,880
Beautiful.

221
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,673
Like all my weddings.

222
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,684
Have you any idea
what that meat...

223
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,269
is doing to your arteries?

224
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,729
Haven't you heard?

225
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,689
Cigarettes
dissolve cholesterol.

226
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,238
No cards, Page.

227
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,739
This is a classy place.

228
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,032
It relaxes me.

229
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:17,204
So? How did we do?

230
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,914
Not too bad.

231
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,958
How not too bad?

232
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,459
About 80.

233
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:23,502
Plus the car.

234
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,005
That's it?

235
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,634
For that I lived 4 months in
a crap hotel without cable?

236
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:33,262
Ugh, I'm so sick of this
small-time bullshit.

237
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,389
Plus, I had to kiss
that greasy mook.

238
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,890
Dean wasn't so bad.

239
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,268
Any way, well make more
in the next one.

240
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,645
I'm thinking Seattle.

241
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:42,813
Maybe San Francisco.

242
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,982
Mom, remember our deal?

243
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,066
OK, there is no next one.

244
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,276
This is it.
I'm going solo.

245
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,402
Oh, here we go--

246
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,863
It's happening, Mom.
Accept it, embrace it, OK?

247
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,573
I am old enough
to be on my own.

248
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,242
You have no idea what it's like
to be all alone.

249
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,244
I'll tell you exactly
what's going to happen.

250
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,371
You'll go off,
you'll get lonely.

251
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:02,249
Some moron hunk will come along,
you'll think it's true love.

252
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,918
You'd never been so sure
of anything in your life.

253
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,961
And then, bam.

254
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,504
He will pull a
conceive and leave...

255
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:09,506
and then it's my
life all over again.

256
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,383
Mom, I am not that stupid.

257
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,014
You know what I mean.

258
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,433
Well, youre right.
I was stupid.

259
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,560
And it left me
pregnant and alone.

260
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,645
If Barbara hadn't taken me in
and shown me the con--

261
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,022
And you taught me.

262
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,523
OK? I'll be fine.

263
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,777
OK. Fine.

264
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,778
If you've made up your mind...

265
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,616
we will go to New York
and divide up everything.

266
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,867
I'll get the check.

267
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,838
Oh, my Lord!

268
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,882
Eww.

269
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,300
What seems to be
the problem, madam?

270
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,302
Well, I was just about
to take a bite...

271
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,846
and I saw glass. Look.

272
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:01,600
I am so sorry, ma'am.
This has never happened.

273
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:04,978
Of course your meal
is, uh, complimentary.

274
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,356
Armando, a bottle
of wine, quickly.

275
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,775
Perhaps a '69 Merlot.

276
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:23,372
Those shoes
are so wrong for this.

277
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,165
Thanks.

278
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,417
I don't understand
the problem, Philip.

279
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:28,752
We deposit our money...

280
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,004
and you give it back
when we say so.

281
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:34,216
I'm afraid it's not that
simple, Ms. Conners.

282
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:39,930
Hello.
I'm Gloria Vogal.

283
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,139
I.R.S.

284
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,227
Hello.

285
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,187
Oh, I see you've
heard of us.

286
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,524
I'm surprised because
we so seldom hear from you.

287
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,235
Well, I suppose
I might be a little late...

288
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,695
with this year's return.

289
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,697
Maybe even the last 7.

290
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,700
Mother, I'm stunned.

291
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,369
I had no idea you would
evade your responsibilities...

292
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,370
as a U.S. Citizen.

293
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,247
Shut up, Miss Conners.

294
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,916
We've never seen
a dime from you, either.

295
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,294
Look, I know
what must have happened.

296
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,880
You see, I always
assumed that my returns...

297
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,048
were filed by my husband.

298
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,550
Oh...

299
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,177
which one?

300
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,387
Look, just because
I've had some trouble...

301
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,680
with my personal
relationships--

302
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:22,723
Ms. Conners...

303
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:26,143
how you earn your money is
of no interest to the I.R.S.

304
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:30,022
Now, how can I put this in
language you'll understand?

305
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,107
We just want our cut.

306
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,151
How much?

307
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:40,157
With interest and penalties,
the total comes to $247,811.

308
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,200
What?

309
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,167
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

310
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,711
Ha ha! I'm afraid
that amount is in addition...

311
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:55,005
to what used to be
in your accounts.

312
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,091
Your latest divorce settlement
arrived this morning.

313
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,219
Thanks.

314
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,221
But that's everything.

315
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,639
It's not all bad.

316
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,517
We give you a full
90 days to pay.

317
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:07,559
Or...

318
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,231
we move forward
with criminal charges...

319
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,691
for felony tax
evasion and fraud.

320
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:19,988
Good luck.

321
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,161
Here's the last of our cash.

322
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:29,248
1,150...

323
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,959
1,170...

324
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,378
1,190.

325
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,381
That's $1,300 each.

326
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:41,009
Wow. Have a nice life
with that, Princess.

327
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,053
-I'll economize.
-Sure.

328
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,931
You can do your own hair,
your own nails.

329
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,976
They actually have some
great shoes at Wal-Mart.

330
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,646
Ugh! All right.

331
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:56,692
One more con,
but only if we do it right.

332
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:57,693
What does that mean?

333
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,862
It means no more
small-time crap.

334
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:00,821
It has to be big.

335
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,115
One big final score
to pay off the l.R.S...

336
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,700
and set me up on my own.

337
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,786
What are you talking about?

338
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,496
Palm Beach.

339
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,123
Palm Beach?

340
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,291
Forget it.

341
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,042
People that rich are
already suspicious.

342
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,502
It's too hard to play.

343
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:18,130
Palm Beach or nothing.

344
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:00,506
Too expensive.

345
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,007
Let's find something else.

346
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,926
I am home.

347
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,812
Now, whats the best way
to get a room?

348
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:18,023
I was thinking
the Trogdon Triangle.

349
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,276
Right. But where are
we going to find...

350
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,445
a trumpet and a talking parrot?

351
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,949
I was thinking of
something simple, traditional.

352
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:29,076
The Flopper Diver.

353
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,452
No way am l--

354
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:31,745
Oh!

355
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:32,913
Oh, my God.

356
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:35,249
She's cracked
her head open.

357
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,292
Oh, darling!
Oh, careful!

358
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,837
You may be paralyzed.

359
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,797
Call a doctor.

360
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,007
But I'm--I'm sure
she'll be fine.

361
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:45,008
I think I'm--

362
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,652
Just please let me know if
there's anything else we can do.

363
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:06,405
Well, you might consider
investing in a mop.

364
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,283
Once again, I apologize.
Now, since we seem...

365
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,618
to have lost your reservation...

366
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,829
we can only let you have
this suite for one night.

367
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,038
Aah!

368
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,085
Uh, then I'm sure we
can work something out.

369
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,588
Could everyone please
just let her rest now?

370
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:23,964
Yeah. Hey!

371
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:37,477
Don't you ever flop me
without my consent.

372
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,646
Oh! It had to look
real, Sweetheart.

373
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,356
You fall lousy when
you know it's coming.

374
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,859
I fall fine!

375
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,194
Fake.

376
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,320
Oh, shut up!

377
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,655
Hey! Oh, no!

378
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:49,781
Cheat!

379
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,159
No, stop!

380
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:56,163
Hey, boss, just got
3 Camrys in--cherry.

381
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:58,373
Parts will bring
100 thou easy.

382
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,541
Great.

383
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:01,335
And the change of
title came through...

384
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,670
on the Mercedes.
You have to sign.

385
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,843
That bitch.

386
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:14,973
You know, this is,
like,the eighth frame...

387
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,935
we've gone through
in a week.

388
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,229
Maybe it's time
to retire this picture.

389
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,106
Why the hell can't I stop
thinking about her?

390
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,234
Was it the legs?

391
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,860
She had amazing legs.

392
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,237
Give me that!

393
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,909
Or maybe it was
that she dumped you...

394
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:36,119
'cause that's never
happened before.

395
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,916
Yeah...yeah.

396
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,210
Who the hell does
she think she is?

397
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,629
She thinks she can do this
to me and just walk out?

398
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,297
Well, she's wrong!

399
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:48,674
I'm gonna find her.

400
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,218
And then?

401
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,598
Then I'm gonna take care of it.

402
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,903
Dr. Arnold Davis.

403
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,239
Made huge money
when an old uncle died...

404
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,907
45, pretty good shape.

405
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,286
Who's the old bag?

406
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,163
His mom.
She lives with him.

407
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,500
Forget it. He's taken.
Mama's boy.

408
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,043
We can get around her.

409
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:27,754
Pass. Mothers are death.

410
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,131
Can't argue that.

411
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,116
David D. Cummings...

412
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:59,620
760 million.
E-commerce stuff...

413
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,372
just ended
marriage number 3.

414
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,832
Downside?

415
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:06,251
Very big on ironclad prenups...

416
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,546
and as you can see,
massive competition.

417
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:11,590
We could handle him.

418
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:14,635
We'd have to be into
a group kind of thing.

419
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:15,844
Menage attrois?

420
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:19,389
Try menage a cinq.

421
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:23,101
Ew. Pass.

422
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,492
Wow. William B. Tensy.

423
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:39,827
C.E.O. of Tensy Tobacco.

424
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,621
Old money, but also
just plain old.

425
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,256
How much?

426
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,675
3 billion with a few
million more every day.

427
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:55,801
Hmm...

428
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:58,470
Not " hmm."  I am not
dating the walking dead.

429
00:27:58,512 --> 00:27:59,847
Page, the older the better.

430
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:01,473
With luck they die
right after the wedding...

431
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,141
and then you're
talking widow money.

432
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,981
I'd have to kiss that?

433
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,149
Well, I'd have to kiss
that way more than you.

434
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,402
Well, maybe you're
into necrophilia.

435
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,366
We'd better work fast.

436
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,873
Why for once can't
we pick someone...

437
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,666
who's just a little bit cute?

438
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,042
Dean was kind of cute.

439
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,421
You're in serious denial.

440
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,839
Cute is dangerous.

441
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:36,216
Cute leads to feeling,
which leads to screwing...

442
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,634
which leads to screwed.

443
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:40,888
I know that we can make that
doctor and his mom work for us.

444
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:42,723
Page, were going with
Tensy, and that's that.

445
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,683
That is not that.

446
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,019
Look, if you want to go
with Tensy, go with Tensy.

447
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,437
I'm working Davis.

448
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,899
Page, I've told you before,
no simultaneous cons.

449
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,359
Too many angles.
They always go bad.

450
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,695
Yeah, but it's not
just that, is it?

451
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:57,779
What?

452
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,741
You don't think I can be
the primary, do you?

453
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,618
I didn't say that.

454
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,537
Although it does take
an enormous amount of skill.

455
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,416
I can make men do anything.

456
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:12,211
Boys. You can make
boys do anything.

457
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,213
Gas station attendants,
bartenders...

458
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,797
the occasional migrant worker...

459
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,550
a one-shot seduction
is child's play...

460
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,512
compared to getting someone
to marry you in 3 months.

461
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:22,971
4 months.

462
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,223
What?

463
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:28,644
Well, it took you
4 months this time.

464
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,854
You used to be
able to do it in 3.

465
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,272
What are you saying?

466
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:35,317
That I'm losing it?
I'm getting too old?

467
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,443
I didn't say that.

468
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:39,738
I'm in terrific shape.
Feel my butt.

469
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,449
Ugh. I am not feeling
your butt again, Mother.

470
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,243
We all know it's wonderful.

471
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,872
I'll tell you what.
We'll play for it.

472
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,207
Winner picks the mark.

473
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:51,458
Great.

474
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,876
We'll cut cards.

475
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,379
Right. I'm gonna
trust your cards?

476
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,339
See that guy
over there at the bar?

477
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:01,176
First one to get him
to buy her a drink wins.

478
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:03,428
Deal.

479
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,566
Hi.

480
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:16,942
Hot.

481
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,653
Yeah, sure is.

482
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,196
Oh!

483
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:31,748
Let me get that for you.

484
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,294
Oh, my!

485
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:38,463
Would you?

486
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:39,840
Sure.

487
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,512
Oh, you're so kind.

488
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:47,764
I'm Betty.

489
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,475
-Hi. My name--
-Excuse me...

490
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,895
may I grab your nuts?

491
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,525
Mmm.

492
00:30:58,567 --> 00:30:59,943
Salty.

493
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,157
Are you OK?

494
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,200
Can I get you a drink?

495
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:07,367
We go with Tensy.

496
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:08,744
Stupid jerk!

497
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:39,775
He doesn't look so bad--
in this light.

498
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:43,028
Yeah, his liver spots
are positively glowing.

499
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,696
All right, let's run
through it one more time.

500
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:46,406
I know what to do.

501
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:02,506
Got a light?

502
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:03,715
Yeah.

503
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:16,979
Your trash is on fire.

504
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:19,439
Holy shit!

505
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,309
Set.

506
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:56,768
Good. Now stay by the phone.

507
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,145
Timing on this is crucial.

508
00:32:58,145 --> 00:32:59,730
Duh!

509
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,648
Always treating me like a child.

510
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:02,816
Child!

511
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:37,392
Excuse me, sir,
but smoking is not permitted.

512
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:40,229
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

513
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,358
Nazi.

514
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:11,218
Oh!

515
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,220
Pardon me.

516
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,429
Is no crime.

517
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:51,842
OK, Dr. Davis, let's see
where you're going tonight.

518
00:34:58,515 --> 00:34:59,850
Good start, Page.

519
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:09,735
Crap!

520
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:22,539
Davis residence.

521
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:24,166
Yeah, Arnold Davis, please.

522
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,043
I'm sorry, he's just left.

523
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,879
Oh, no. This is--

524
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,339
He left me a message.

525
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,258
I'm supposed
to meet him tonight--

526
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,469
I can't read
my maid's handwriting--

527
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:36,512
Who is this?

528
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:37,554
This is--

529
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:39,765
Stupid cell phone.

530
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:42,017
Mrs. Whiler?

531
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,603
Right. Right.
This is Mrs. Whiler.

532
00:35:44,645 --> 00:35:48,524
I believe he said the Glades.

533
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:49,816
Right. And that's on?

534
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,486
I think it's on
the far end of Ocean.

535
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:54,196
Great. Cutting out. Thank--

536
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,448
Hi. Can I get you a drink?

537
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,451
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

538
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,954
You really blow me away
with your creativity.

539
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:46,665
-Well, l--
-Well, l...

540
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:48,208
Your recovery is even better.

541
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,712
Do you even care
at all who I am?

542
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:54,089
I mean, I could be
the Antichrist or have...

543
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,966
the intelligence of a thermos,
but unfortunately...

544
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:58,302
those are not the matters
the male penis ponders.

545
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:02,139
So, please, tell me...

546
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:03,849
why did you walk
all the way over here...

547
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,976
to ask to get me a drink?

548
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,605
Well, because I'm the bartender.

549
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:13,442
Oh.

550
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,653
Martini, very dry.

551
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,030
Sure.

552
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,701
Our next item is
an exquisite piece...

553
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,036
from the Kerner estate...

554
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:27,331
a stunning work
by Feodor Tergeniev...

555
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:30,834
entitled Form in Repose.

556
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:36,006
I'm looking for
an opening bid of 130,000.

557
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:37,299
130.

558
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:39,635
Very good. I have 130.
Do I hear 140?

559
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,136
140.

560
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,472
Thank you.
Do I hear 150?

561
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:45,516
150,000.

562
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:50,187
160.

563
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,189
I am offer 170.

564
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,943
175.

565
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,861
Was that 175, sir?

566
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,866
I'll take that.
175,000.

567
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,620
180.

568
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:09,873
I have 180.
Do I hear 190?

569
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:15,838
Do I hear 190?

570
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:19,925
I really must hear a number
or see a paddle, sir.

571
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,176
I think he--

572
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:22,678
Yes, ma'am,
I have your bid.

573
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,180
It's to you
at $180,000.

574
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:26,640
Going once...

575
00:38:26,682 --> 00:38:28,267
twice...

576
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:29,977
sold--

577
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,604
to the persistent
woman on my right.

578
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,361
Thanks.
You did good.

579
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:40,946
Bye.

580
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,031
Uh, that's $3.50.

581
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,450
I'll flip you for it.
Call it.

582
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:48,245
-No, we don't really--
-Call it!

583
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:51,206
Tails.

584
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:56,962
Heads. Oh, too bad.
Thanks.

585
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,263
Well, Jack, looks like
she got a free drink...

586
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:08,140
and one of your balls.

587
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,559
Nah, I just think she's
nervous being on her own.

588
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,566
Oh, yeah.
She's a delicate flower.

589
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,763
Oh, wait!
I think I see crack.

590
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:51,350
-That's just his butt, lady.
-Let me see.

591
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:54,269
Hmm.

592
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:57,814
Hmm. Oh.

593
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:00,692
Oh.

594
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:03,904
Oh.

595
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:07,199
Ooh.

596
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:12,454
Looks good.

597
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:13,956
From where I'm standing...

598
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:14,998
hmm.

599
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:36,687
Oh!

600
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,231
Oh, my God!

601
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:41,233
Oh!

602
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:42,734
What, what?
What is the matter?

603
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:46,155
My--my beautiful man.
He ruined.

604
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,281
Ruined!

605
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:49,741
I'm sure we can have
this expertly repaired.

606
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:52,744
No. Man thing off,
deal off.

607
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:57,124
What good is to me now?
He has no " pipiska."

608
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:45,047
Mother, did you have any
trouble finding the place?

609
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:46,381
This is beyond civilization.

610
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:47,799
It was impossible
to find.

611
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,343
Son of a bitch!

612
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,399
Ow!

613
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:06,151
Ow! Ow!

614
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,736
Oh!

615
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:09,446
I'm so sorry.

616
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:10,989
Get away from him!
Get away!

617
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:14,827
I told you it was dangerous to
come to these low-class bars.

618
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:17,246
It stings, Mama.
It stings so bad.

619
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:18,705
Oh, mother will help you.

620
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:20,415
The retina is detached.

621
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:22,751
I know it! Ow!

622
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,753
Are you OK now?

623
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,797
Yes. You idi--

624
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:29,299
" Idi"  what?

625
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:34,721
Yeah.

626
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:36,223
Subject is en route.

627
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:37,808
He'll pass the checkpoint
in 10 minutes.

628
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,268
Everything set?

629
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,269
Yeah. Of course.

630
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,229
What's wrong, Page?

631
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,689
Mother can tell
something's wrong.

632
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,607
Mother knows nothing.

633
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:46,984
I'm following
right behind him...

634
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:49,194
so be sure
to remove the spikes.

635
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:50,571
And he mustn't see you.

636
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,489
He must think no one else
is around so we can bond.

637
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:54,867
I know, I know.
You're driving me crazy.

638
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,618
Well, youre driving me crazy.

639
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,371
Well, that answers
the question of whether...

640
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,123
you're already
in a relationship.

641
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:04,501
Since you can't seem
to read my subtle signals...

642
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:07,212
I'll help you out.
Piss off!

643
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:14,219
Everyone is a little
irritable after they choke.

644
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:40,579
Two headlights.
That's not him. Crap.

645
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:54,635
That was wrong
on so many levels.

646
00:44:04,228 --> 00:44:06,313
-You!
-What happened?

647
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:07,940
What are you doing here?

648
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:10,359
-I followed you.
-More like stalked me.

649
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,653
Listen, mouth breather,
I am fully capable...

650
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:14,530
and really in the mood
to kick the shit out of...

651
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:16,907
your psychotic, skulking ass.

652
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:23,038
Does this look familiar?

653
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:26,124
Might be mine.

654
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,460
Well, if you're not sure...

655
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,379
Thanks! Now go.

656
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,298
Look, my car doesn't drive
so good with a tree in it.

657
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,634
What a baby!
It's a flat. I'll fix it.

658
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:38,303
Wait, first we better go clear
that stuff out of the road.

659
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:39,346
Another car could--

660
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:41,223
No! I'll do it.
Just get the spare.

661
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:42,224
Now!

662
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,101
Look, I'm willing to explore...

663
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:46,019
the whole being
dominated thing, OK?

664
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,980
But let's just take it slow.

665
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:57,072
-Uh-oh!
-Watch out!

666
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,830
Oh!

667
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,167
Oh!

668
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:09,710
What did you push me for?

669
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:11,461
I saved you, you moron.

670
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:27,060
That can't be good.
I'd better check it out.

671
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:29,521
Oh, wait, wait!
I'm hurt.

672
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:32,357
No, youre not.
Nothing could hurt you.

673
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,026
Are you calling me a liar?

674
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:36,403
All right,
where are you hurt, then?

675
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:38,113
My ankle.

676
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:40,616
See?

677
00:45:47,498 --> 00:45:48,999
What the hell?

678
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,174
Perfect.

679
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,510
Oh!

680
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:02,846
No!

681
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,772
Jeez, they're really
piling up up there.

682
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:12,773
My ankle.

683
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:15,150
Your ankle is fine.
I'm going.

684
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,370
Are you mixing medications?

685
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,330
You're ruining the magic, idiot.

686
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:32,543
I'm much sorry.

687
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:35,921
Must be glass in road.

688
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:40,092
Ah, the statue stealer.

689
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:41,760
Why is it whenever I see you...

690
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,679
things seem to be
going into the crapper?

691
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,849
You have head injury.
I rush you to hospital.

692
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,016
No, no, no.

693
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,478
I don't. No. No.

694
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,980
The police will
be along shortly...

695
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,524
and they'll sort this out.

696
00:46:58,277 --> 00:46:59,278
Ooh!

697
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:00,946
See?

698
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:04,032
Delayed shooting head pains.

699
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:07,119
Come. To hospital we go.

700
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:09,329
What about your car?
You have flat tires.

701
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:10,706
Oh, is nothing.

702
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:12,082
Ooh.

703
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:25,262
What the hell are you doing?
Get off me!

704
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,805
What?

705
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,265
-You were the one who...
-I got to go.

706
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:40,819
How do I look?

707
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:43,238
If I were a guy, I'd do you.

708
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,407
You're sweet.

709
00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:48,368
I'm going back to the hospital
to see if I can fix...

710
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,870
the mess you made last night.

711
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:52,206
With that on,
he'll forgive anything.

712
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:53,415
He better...

713
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:54,625
for your sake.

714
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,502
Be nice or I won't tell you
which eye looks bigger.

715
00:47:58,504 --> 00:47:59,922
Which?

716
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:03,258
-Are you going to be nice?
-I'm always nice.

717
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,635
The left.

718
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:06,178
Here, use my eyeliner.

719
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:10,891
Shit.

720
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,437
I want my purse, jerk-off.

721
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:17,606
That's not very friendly.

722
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:19,149
Now, I want you
to go back out...

723
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,651
and this time,
when you kick the door open...

724
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:21,902
say something nice.

725
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:23,612
You stole my purse, dipshit...

726
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:26,532
and you stole it so I'd have to
see your ugly-ass face again.

727
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:30,452
No, you forgot your purse
for the second time...

728
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:31,954
because you were in such
a hurry to strand me...

729
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:34,331
-in the middle of nowhere.
-Look, just give it to me.

730
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:37,042
Or would you rather have
my heel up your ass?

731
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:39,545
Who told you I'm into that?

732
00:48:43,715 --> 00:48:45,217
Pretty rough on
the boss, werent you?

733
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:47,135
You know, he's not
really into ass play.

734
00:48:47,177 --> 00:48:48,679
That's just, like,
his sense of humor.

735
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:51,181
He owns this place?

736
00:48:51,223 --> 00:48:53,433
Yeah, his dad left it to him.

737
00:48:53,475 --> 00:48:54,893
Of course, all these
development creeps...

738
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,271
are trying to give him,
like, 3 mil for the place.

739
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:00,607
Whole world's going to be
Gaps and Starbucks, right?

740
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,945
He's loaded.

741
00:49:04,987 --> 00:49:07,322
Good, Page.

742
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,579
Greetings.

743
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,041
Oh, it's you.

744
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,085
Doctors don't want me to smoke.

745
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,545
It's ridiculous.

746
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:23,797
They depend on cigarettes.

747
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,884
A perfect scapegoat
for their incompetence.

748
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:29,178
I assume you're here
about the insurance.

749
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,304
My attorneys will
take care of it.

750
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:32,181
That won't be necessary.

751
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,432
I have no want to sue you.

752
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:34,433
Sue me?

753
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:36,476
My people will tear you a new...

754
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:42,107
I am only come
to see how you feel...

755
00:49:43,442 --> 00:49:47,946
my poor, poor, Babushka.

756
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:54,661
That's very nice of you, Mrs...

757
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:57,498
Miss.
Just call me...

758
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,792
Ulga.

759
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:05,672
-Ulga?
-Mmm.

760
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,674
Well, thats lovely, Ulga.

761
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:39,164
Yes?

762
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:42,251
I am Ulga Yevanova.
I am here to...

763
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:45,796
Yes. We've been expecting you.

764
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:50,133
I am Miss Madress.
I run this household.

765
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:53,303
Oh, good for you.

766
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:54,930
I will announce you.

767
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:00,644
We have a bitch alert.

768
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:08,569
Come on, bartender.
It's your night off.

769
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,487
Do something fun.

770
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,618
Good boy.

771
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,851
I love it here.

772
00:51:40,893 --> 00:51:42,603
It's the only
bloody place left...

773
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:44,354
that doesn't make you feel
like a serial killer...

774
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:45,898
for having a damn smoke.

775
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:47,608
Yes, is lovely.

776
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,280
I'll be your waiter
tonight--Vladimir.

777
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,199
Allow me to tell you
tonight's specials.

778
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,117
No need for English
tonight, Vlad.

779
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:59,119
We have one of
your country women here.

780
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:00,662
Oh, wonderful.

781
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:03,999
So, tonight we have...

782
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:07,336
Da.

783
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:10,589
Da. Da.

784
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:19,097
Excellent choice.
The steaktartare.

785
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:23,894
Oh, I love a woman
who eats raw meat.

786
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:49,127
That's real nice!

787
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,098
You're not just going
to stand there.

788
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:02,099
Help me.

789
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:04,768
Please.

790
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:08,105
Isn't that the shoe you
wanted to jam up my ass?

791
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:10,482
No, that was the 6-inch heel.

792
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:12,317
Now come on.

793
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,945
What are you doing here?

794
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:17,948
Uh...working.

795
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,950
Working?

796
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:22,661
You some kind of wilderness
female mud wrestler?

797
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,831
I am an environmentalist
studying the effect...

798
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:28,667
of waste run of from
the neighboring wetlands.

799
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,170
Oh, well...

800
00:53:31,211 --> 00:53:34,673
you environmentalists
really dress hot.

801
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:35,924
Yeah, well...

802
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:37,885
there's no law that says
you can't look good...

803
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:39,845
while you're saving stuff.

804
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:41,471
So, why are you following me?

805
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:44,933
-I'm not following you!
-Then what are you doing here?

806
00:53:46,393 --> 00:53:48,353
Come on, I'll show you.

807
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:52,357
You're not out here burying
high-school kids, are you?

808
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,527
Well, they egged my car.

809
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:08,582
What do you do?
Spy on people humping in boats?

810
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:10,250
That's so perverted.

811
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:12,586
I photograph stars.

812
00:54:12,628 --> 00:54:14,087
Look, just because
they're famous...

813
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:17,132
doesn't mean they don't deserve
their privacy, too.

814
00:54:17,174 --> 00:54:18,675
Who you got?

815
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:22,179
The stars up there.

816
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:26,558
You sneak all the way out here
to stare at space and shit?

817
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:30,813
No, I come here to get away
from the lights of the city...

818
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:34,024
so I can see
the space and shit.

819
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:38,320
-Why?
-Take a look.

820
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:46,328
Jesus.

821
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,080
That's the Crab Nebula.

822
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:51,124
That is the exact color
of a sapphire ring I wanted.

823
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:53,460
OK.

824
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:57,923
And this...

825
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:01,093
is the great
globular cluster in Hercules.

826
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:02,970
I don't think
I want to see that.

827
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,017
Wow.

828
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:10,769
Good cluster.

829
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:15,149
And I think you can also see
the Corona Borealis, too.

830
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,943
Wait, wait, I'm not done
with the globular thing.

831
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,489
OK...

832
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:50,893
I love to watch a woman eat.

833
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:53,729
It is surely one of
the most sensual acts.

834
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:24,218
Is such joy to hear
my native tongue again.

835
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:28,472
I deeply appreciate
what you say, and...

836
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:32,434
what you don't say.

837
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:40,984
Oh, William,
so much loudness.

838
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:46,615
Can we not go somewhere
I can relate to you...

839
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:47,699
orally.

840
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,662
All right.

841
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:54,706
Who will favor us
with next song?

842
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:01,588
We have a fellow
country woman here.

843
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,173
No, I am so...

844
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:08,053
Please, I am so not musical.

845
00:57:09,555 --> 00:57:12,057
-Please, uh...
-How about " Karabuschka?"

846
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,059
I know there isn't
a Russian alive...

847
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:15,853
who doesn't know " Karabuschka!"

848
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:32,494
Karabuschka

849
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:35,539
Da, da, da

850
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,627
Moscow

851
00:57:42,462 --> 00:57:43,964
Leningrad

852
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:47,676
Minsk...

853
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:53,140
Oh, you know,
I am just fooling.

854
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:57,269
I am so full
of good humor.

855
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:18,999
Flew in from
Miami Beach B.O.A.C.

856
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:22,628
Didn't get to bed last night

857
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:30,093
On the way the paper bag
was on my knee

858
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:33,430
Man, I had a dreadful flight

859
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:35,432
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.

860
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:40,270
You don't know
how lucky you are, boy

861
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:42,481
Back in the U.S.S.R.

862
00:58:45,317 --> 00:58:48,779
Been away so long
I hardly knew the place

863
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:51,156
Gee, it's good to be back home

864
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:55,577
Leave it till tomorrow
to unpack my case

865
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,788
Honey, disconnect the phone

866
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:59,665
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.

867
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:04,461
You don't know
how lucky you are, boy

868
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:05,671
Back in the U.S.

869
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:07,130
Back in the U.S.

870
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:09,341
Back in the U.S.S.R.

871
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:12,845
Look, theres another one.

872
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:17,307
Oh, there's two at once.
Did you see that?

873
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:18,517
Yeah.

874
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,728
God, I never knew you could
have this much fun for free.

875
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:26,984
Well, it's not completely free.

876
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:35,701
So, are you ready
to tell me the truth?

877
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:38,287
What?

878
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:40,455
Tell me why
you're here, really.

879
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:45,169
I told you,
I'm an environmentalist...

880
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:48,046
student at
the University of Miami.

881
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:50,048
What? You don't believe me?

882
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:53,468
Well, I'd like to, but...

883
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,220
What about my butt?

884
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,767
-Ooh, I got to go.
-Again?

885
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:04,062
-Yeah, I have work to do.
-It's 11:00 at night.

886
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:06,732
I know, but I have to write
an environmental impact report.

887
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,734
Will it mention me?

888
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,029
-Wait! What's your name?
-Uh, Jane.

889
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:13,363
Will I see you again?

890
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,240
Try wishing on a star.

891
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:26,210
Is that 5 people?

892
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:34,426
Keys are in it.

893
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,949
Hey, Mom.
How did it go?

894
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:59,034
Perfect.

895
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:04,957
His infatuation
is right on schedule.

896
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,208
You know, youre home now.

897
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,793
You can stop
with the accent.

898
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:11,421
-What's that?
-What's what?

899
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:17,678
-Mud?
-I gave myself a facial...

900
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,304
some special local stuff.

901
01:01:20,556 --> 01:01:23,225
I think I'll to take a nice
long shower and go to bed.

902
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:24,268
Good night.

903
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,995
Smoking is part of
the fun of being a kid.

904
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:46,206
We just did some tests
on some 9-year-olds.

905
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:47,457
After a little puking...

906
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:49,918
why, you couldn't drag them
away from the stuff.

907
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:53,130
You're only young once.

908
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:54,965
Why not indulge, I always say.

909
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,886
Oh, darling, what matter?

910
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:01,013
Head pain back again?

911
01:02:01,054 --> 01:02:03,140
No, no, it's all right.

912
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,905
-I have a gift for you.
-A gift?

913
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:21,909
A gift! Oh!

914
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:33,212
Oh, a personal fire device.

915
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:35,422
I'm not insisting
you take up smoking...

916
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:39,176
but I thought it would
give you some incentive.

917
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:43,764
There is nothing sexier
than smoke billowing proudly...

918
01:02:43,805 --> 01:02:49,978
out of a woman's hot,
red, engorged nostrils.

919
01:02:51,897 --> 01:02:56,318
That image will haunt me.

920
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,903
Still a little sleepy, my dear?

921
01:02:57,945 --> 01:03:03,158
Oh, no, no, it was
another wonderful night.

922
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:09,289
I think that I deserve
a big kiss for that big gift.

923
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:12,251
Oh, yes.

924
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:14,545
Is no getting
around that.

925
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:24,221
Oh, oh, no.

926
01:03:24,263 --> 01:03:29,893
We mustn't.
God is everywhere.

927
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:32,646
Yes, he is, isn't he?

928
01:03:32,688 --> 01:03:34,189
Nosy bastard.

929
01:03:35,566 --> 01:03:39,153
I'll have Miss Madress
get your purse.

930
01:03:46,785 --> 01:03:49,079
Is he that repulsive to you?

931
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:57,129
No. Is Russian
expression of happiness.

932
01:03:57,171 --> 01:03:59,464
Ptui, ptui,
oh, I am so happy.

933
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:02,217
Save it.
I'm on to you.

934
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:06,263
You're attracted to me?

935
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:09,057
Oh, flattering,
but I no do females.

936
01:04:09,683 --> 01:04:12,019
I've been with him for 7 years.

937
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:13,812
I've seen him with many women.

938
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:15,355
I've never worried.

939
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:17,399
Passing amusements.

940
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:20,152
But you, oh, you're good, baby.

941
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:24,072
I no understand.
What is you want?

942
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:29,745
I is want your ex-commie ass
out of his life.

943
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:31,455
I didn't put up
with his crap for years...

944
01:04:31,497 --> 01:04:33,332
just to be squeezed out
right before he kicks.

945
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:35,626
I've put in the time,
and I expect a big payoff.

946
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:41,423
Oh, you must believe,
I have true feelings for him.

947
01:04:41,465 --> 01:04:44,843
Oh, spare me
your Bolshevik bullshit.

948
01:04:44,885 --> 01:04:46,136
Either you disappear...

949
01:04:46,178 --> 01:04:48,555
or I tell him exactly
what I saw.

950
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:52,810
Your dark honesty
is refreshing...

951
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:55,020
but please, I beg you...

952
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:59,024
leave me one more night
to bow out gracefully.

953
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,165
I have something for you.

954
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:25,843
I know it's not the sapphire
you wanted, but...

955
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:28,679
It sure isn't.

956
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,056
It's a meteor fragment.

957
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,641
Like the ones
we were watching?

958
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:35,978
That's been to the far reaches
of our solar system and back.

959
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:38,355
No lousy sapphire has
ever pulled that off.

960
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:43,902
You don't do anything
like normal people, do you?

961
01:05:44,528 --> 01:05:45,654
Some things.

962
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,123
Kitchen's through there.

963
01:06:32,165 --> 01:06:35,544
Master bedroom's upstairs.
Her room is down the hall.

964
01:06:35,585 --> 01:06:37,087
You have 7 minutes.

965
01:06:37,128 --> 01:06:38,588
Here you go.

966
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:39,631
The thing that's screwing us...

967
01:06:39,673 --> 01:06:42,842
is all this secondhand
smoke nonsense.

968
01:06:43,677 --> 01:06:45,303
They've convicted
the tobacco companies...

969
01:06:45,345 --> 01:06:47,263
without a shred of evidence.

970
01:06:50,392 --> 01:06:53,812
Hmm...is oddness.

971
01:06:53,853 --> 01:06:55,563
What?

972
01:06:55,605 --> 01:06:59,067
Costly lighter gift
you gave is missing.

973
01:06:59,109 --> 01:07:01,694
Oh, you must have
left it somewhere.

974
01:07:01,736 --> 01:07:04,823
Never. I cherish too much.

975
01:07:04,864 --> 01:07:06,407
Perhaps...

976
01:07:07,826 --> 01:07:09,577
No.

977
01:07:09,619 --> 01:07:13,540
Is inconceivablish.

978
01:07:13,581 --> 01:07:15,041
What is inconceivablish?

979
01:07:17,001 --> 01:07:19,921
Well, your housekeep
did much admire...

980
01:07:19,963 --> 01:07:26,552
and when she give me purse
to leave yesterday, was open.

981
01:07:28,137 --> 01:07:29,222
Sir, I swear to you...

982
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:32,183
I would never take so much as
a hairpin from this household.

983
01:07:33,434 --> 01:07:36,104
Is this not clothing
you wear yesterday...

984
01:07:36,145 --> 01:07:38,397
when you see me out?

985
01:07:40,149 --> 01:07:41,275
Hello.

986
01:07:43,903 --> 01:07:45,488
She set me up.

987
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:48,324
She could have slipped that
into my pocket any time.

988
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:54,121
You doubt me?

989
01:07:54,163 --> 01:07:55,831
Oh, William.

990
01:08:03,506 --> 01:08:06,467
Oh, how you can sleep
on so lumpy a...

991
01:08:08,761 --> 01:08:10,179
My wife's old jewellery.

992
01:08:10,221 --> 01:08:14,058
Why you are stealing from
loyal, kind employer man?

993
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,102
No! It's her.
Can't you see?

994
01:08:17,853 --> 01:08:19,396
You bitch!

995
01:08:24,818 --> 01:08:27,071
My cigarettes?

996
01:08:27,112 --> 01:08:29,531
I feel like vomiting.

997
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:33,661
Oh, please, Mr. Tensy.

998
01:08:33,702 --> 01:08:36,330
I have been a dedicated
and trust worthy servant...

999
01:08:36,372 --> 01:08:37,915
for over 7 years.

1000
01:08:37,956 --> 01:08:40,292
Look into my eyes.

1001
01:08:40,334 --> 01:08:43,337
You must believe in my complete
and total innocence.

1002
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:59,228
If it's at all possible...

1003
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:01,313
could you slap her around
a little bit?

1004
01:09:03,565 --> 01:09:05,025
That's very good, Darling.

1005
01:09:05,067 --> 01:09:07,819
You're doing better.

1006
01:09:07,861 --> 01:09:10,030
Come on, let's hear
a little pain.

1007
01:09:11,531 --> 01:09:13,116
I've set you up with
an interview...

1008
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:15,452
for Tensy's housekeeper
position tomorrow.

1009
01:09:15,494 --> 01:09:17,454
Tomorrow?
That's Saturday.

1010
01:09:17,496 --> 01:09:19,790
Well, there are no weekends
in conning, dear.

1011
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:21,625
I'll go the first thing Monday.

1012
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:23,460
No, you'll go tomorrow.

1013
01:09:23,502 --> 01:09:25,837
We can't take the chance of
someone else getting that job.

1014
01:09:25,879 --> 01:09:27,672
You have to start
getting close to him now.

1015
01:09:27,714 --> 01:09:30,300
My god, he's days away
from popping the question.

1016
01:09:30,342 --> 01:09:31,843
No way.

1017
01:09:31,885 --> 01:09:33,762
You couldn't have gotten
him that far this fast.

1018
01:09:33,804 --> 01:09:35,764
Have you really
learned so little?

1019
01:09:36,848 --> 01:09:39,976
One month flat.
That's a new record.

1020
01:09:40,018 --> 01:09:41,436
Mom's still got it.

1021
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:44,981
Jack, I'm still
coming to the game.

1022
01:09:45,023 --> 01:09:46,524
I just may be a little late,
that's all.

1023
01:09:48,026 --> 01:09:49,986
Well, hey, I'm sure
the van can wait...

1024
01:09:50,028 --> 01:09:51,529
for, like, 5 minutes.

1025
01:09:52,864 --> 01:09:54,824
Look, l-l'll probably
make it on time anyway.

1026
01:09:54,866 --> 01:09:55,825
I gotta go.

1027
01:09:55,867 --> 01:09:56,868
Bye.

1028
01:09:59,037 --> 01:10:01,998
Sorry I'm running late,
Miss Breckenhall, but...

1029
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:06,252
I've been losing consciousness
more frequently lately.

1030
01:10:06,294 --> 01:10:08,296
Allergy season, I think.

1031
01:10:08,296 --> 01:10:10,298
Well, it's no problem at all...

1032
01:10:10,298 --> 01:10:11,925
But please, call me Allison.

1033
01:10:11,966 --> 01:10:13,092
Oh, well...

1034
01:10:13,134 --> 01:10:14,469
Allison, l--

1035
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:16,429
I just have a few
questions to ask you.

1036
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:29,567
Do you smoke, Allison?

1037
01:10:29,609 --> 01:10:32,612
-No.
-No.

1038
01:10:32,654 --> 01:10:34,489
Well, uh...

1039
01:10:38,993 --> 01:10:40,620
we gotta go!

1040
01:10:40,661 --> 01:10:42,830
She said she'd be
a little late.

1041
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,666
20 minutes
is not a little.

1042
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:48,002
We've entered
stood-up territory.

1043
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:49,629
Then I worked for
the English Ambassador...

1044
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:52,256
to Turkey for 4 1/2 years,
until they shot him.

1045
01:10:52,298 --> 01:10:53,925
Oh, they shot him?

1046
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:55,468
But I kept cleaning...

1047
01:10:55,509 --> 01:10:57,470
right up until they
burned the embassy down.

1048
01:10:57,511 --> 01:10:59,680
Well, that was very loyal.

1049
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,933
So, when should I start?

1050
01:11:01,974 --> 01:11:04,101
If you could just...

1051
01:11:04,143 --> 01:11:05,895
fill out
this application form...

1052
01:11:05,936 --> 01:11:06,937
then I can, uh...

1053
01:11:06,979 --> 01:11:08,856
verify your employment.

1054
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:11,067
Oh, certainly.

1055
01:11:11,108 --> 01:11:13,527
Oh! Oh!

1056
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:14,945
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1057
01:11:14,987 --> 01:11:15,946
Oh...

1058
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:17,656
I'll get towel.

1059
01:11:35,841 --> 01:11:39,303
Y-You seem very dedicated
to your work, Allison.

1060
01:11:39,345 --> 01:11:40,971
Something inside me--

1061
01:11:41,013 --> 01:11:44,183
this need to please my employer
in any way possible.

1062
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:52,149
Here is towel.

1063
01:11:52,191 --> 01:11:55,152
And I find other
employment form.

1064
01:11:55,194 --> 01:11:57,321
Oh, well...

1065
01:11:57,362 --> 01:11:59,990
I-l don't think
that'll be necessary.

1066
01:12:00,032 --> 01:12:02,576
Allison seems...

1067
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,119
more than qualified.

1068
01:12:07,414 --> 01:12:09,291
Hmm, it's still wet.

1069
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,295
Not bad, huh?

1070
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,423
Oh, what?

1071
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:17,591
It's just a little hacky...

1072
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:20,761
to go right for
the member massage.

1073
01:12:20,802 --> 01:12:22,763
What are you doing
the rest of today?

1074
01:12:22,804 --> 01:12:24,431
Oh, um, I don't know.

1075
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:25,766
Beach, nap, nothing.

1076
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:26,808
See ya.

1077
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,786
Shit!

1078
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:50,165
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1079
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,295
You really are
a delicate flower.

1080
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,631
Jack!

1081
01:12:57,672 --> 01:13:00,300
You missed the game.
Why didn't you go?

1082
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:01,801
I don't know.

1083
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:04,637
My friends have
this theory that...

1084
01:13:07,307 --> 01:13:08,850
I'm in love with you.

1085
01:13:40,298 --> 01:13:41,591
Hello, Daughter.

1086
01:13:43,676 --> 01:13:44,802
What are you doing here?

1087
01:13:44,844 --> 01:13:46,429
I thought you'd be
out with Tensy.

1088
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:49,265
Sometimes people aren't where
they say they're going to be.

1089
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:51,142
Oh, well, I got bored
hanging around here...

1090
01:13:51,184 --> 01:13:52,643
so I took myself out for a walk.

1091
01:13:52,685 --> 01:13:54,312
Bullshit.

1092
01:13:54,353 --> 01:13:58,065
I saw you with your boy friend.

1093
01:13:58,107 --> 01:14:00,234
You spied on me?

1094
01:14:00,276 --> 01:14:02,945
So, this is why you've been
being so nice to me.

1095
01:14:02,987 --> 01:14:04,405
I have not been nice to you.

1096
01:14:04,447 --> 01:14:08,326
You betray me
for some bartender.

1097
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:11,245
That bartender
happens to own the bar...

1098
01:14:11,287 --> 01:14:13,914
and has a firm offer
to sell for 3 million.

1099
01:14:13,956 --> 01:14:15,207
You're not ready, Page.

1100
01:14:15,249 --> 01:14:16,751
Yeah, so not ready
that I already got him...

1101
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:18,002
to say he loves me.

1102
01:14:18,044 --> 01:14:20,087
I mean you're not
ready to con a guy...

1103
01:14:20,129 --> 01:14:21,922
without falling
in love yourself.

1104
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:23,758
Give me a break.
I am in complete control.

1105
01:14:23,799 --> 01:14:24,759
I saw the kiss.

1106
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,427
Your eyes were closed.

1107
01:14:27,803 --> 01:14:29,054
That was the sun.

1108
01:14:29,096 --> 01:14:31,265
Last time the sun
got in my eyes...

1109
01:14:31,307 --> 01:14:32,433
I wound up
with a daughter.

1110
01:14:32,475 --> 01:14:33,767
Yeah, and that's just
about the worst thing...

1111
01:14:33,809 --> 01:14:35,603
that ever happened
to you, isn't it?

1112
01:14:38,314 --> 01:14:40,774
I'm a pro, Mother,
and I'll prove it.

1113
01:15:01,336 --> 01:15:03,756
There, nothing...

1114
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:08,135
but the best from you.

1115
01:15:08,177 --> 01:15:10,304
Well, give me a chance
to make it even better.

1116
01:15:29,781 --> 01:15:30,907
Crap!

1117
01:15:30,949 --> 01:15:33,452
-What's wrong?
-I got to go.

1118
01:15:33,452 --> 01:15:35,787
-Why?
-Because I'm no good for you.

1119
01:15:35,787 --> 01:15:37,414
I'll be the judge
of that.

1120
01:15:37,497 --> 01:15:39,249
No, I just--
you have to trust me.

1121
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:40,625
I am not a good person.

1122
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:41,626
No, you are good.

1123
01:15:41,626 --> 01:15:43,920
You may not know it,
but I do.

1124
01:15:43,962 --> 01:15:46,381
You come on tough,
but it's all just an act.

1125
01:15:46,423 --> 01:15:47,424
I mean, you
don't even believe...

1126
01:15:47,507 --> 01:15:48,967
in sleeping together
before marriage.

1127
01:15:48,967 --> 01:15:50,719
You're like a Brady
or an Osmond or something.

1128
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,429
Look, you don't get it, OK?

1129
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:54,848
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

1130
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:58,268
Look, I know you're not
really an environmentalist.

1131
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:59,644
Who cares?

1132
01:15:59,644 --> 01:16:00,937
The important thing is...

1133
01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:03,273
I love you
and I want to be with you.

1134
01:16:06,609 --> 01:16:07,902
I got ta go.

1135
01:16:15,285 --> 01:16:17,579
You win.
I drop the con.

1136
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,790
-It's for the best, Dear.
-Shut up, Mother.

1137
01:16:40,977 --> 01:16:42,061
Barbara!

1138
01:16:49,026 --> 01:16:50,778
You are a lifesaver.

1139
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,948
To pull that job off
on such short notice--

1140
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:55,783
I was taught by the best.

1141
01:16:55,825 --> 01:16:57,118
I had a blast.

1142
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,619
I've been out of
the game for so long...

1143
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:00,121
I've forgotten how much
fun it could be--

1144
01:17:00,163 --> 01:17:02,373
even though we were
conning your own daughter...

1145
01:17:02,415 --> 01:17:05,334
who I haven't seen
since she was what,4?

1146
01:17:05,376 --> 01:17:06,544
3.

1147
01:17:06,586 --> 01:17:08,212
But we weren't conning her.

1148
01:17:08,254 --> 01:17:09,880
We were protecting her.

1149
01:17:09,922 --> 01:17:12,216
She wanted to run
off on her own...

1150
01:17:12,258 --> 01:17:14,260
and this was the only
way to stop her.

1151
01:17:14,302 --> 01:17:16,679
You know, you won't be
able to stop her forever.

1152
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:18,889
I know that.

1153
01:17:18,931 --> 01:17:22,393
You know, Page is an amazing,
brilliant, talented girl.

1154
01:17:22,435 --> 01:17:24,061
But she's still green.

1155
01:17:24,103 --> 01:17:25,062
When she's ready...

1156
01:17:25,104 --> 01:17:26,731
I'll be the first
one to tell her.

1157
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:28,649
And you're sure
she's not ready now?

1158
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:33,070
I just caught her
kissing some loser...

1159
01:17:33,112 --> 01:17:35,114
with her eyes closed.

1160
01:17:36,615 --> 01:17:37,950
Really?

1161
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:43,622
I'll get this.

1162
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:47,585
Classy.

1163
01:17:47,626 --> 01:17:49,211
I'm still learning from you.

1164
01:17:54,633 --> 01:17:55,801
Sweetie, I'm home.

1165
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:58,804
Sounds like a good day.

1166
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,597
Yeah, it was fantastic.

1167
01:18:00,639 --> 01:18:01,932
Yech, what is Tensy...

1168
01:18:01,974 --> 01:18:03,392
Iike, the largest
producer of phlegm...

1169
01:18:03,434 --> 01:18:04,727
on the East Coast?

1170
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:06,395
I just officially quit smoking.

1171
01:18:06,437 --> 01:18:08,897
Well, the good news
keeps on coming.

1172
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:11,567
Hey, I got a killer
dress for tonight.

1173
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:14,236
That, plus the official
letter cannot fail.

1174
01:18:14,278 --> 01:18:17,239
-You want to see?
-No. I'm going out for a walk.

1175
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:22,911
Ok, well, uh...

1176
01:18:22,953 --> 01:18:24,079
I'm already late.

1177
01:18:29,459 --> 01:18:31,503
Jane, Jane!
Don't hang up!

1178
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:41,930
You gotta give up
on that girl, man.

1179
01:18:41,972 --> 01:18:44,933
Yeah, there's something
weird about her.

1180
01:18:46,476 --> 01:18:48,562
Yeah, but that's what I liked.

1181
01:18:48,603 --> 01:18:50,772
Me, too.

1182
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:04,619
What are you doing here?

1183
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:06,079
I was coming to you.

1184
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:07,289
Let me in.

1185
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:08,832
I have a surprise.

1186
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:11,167
Uh, moment.
I'm, uh...naked.

1187
01:19:11,209 --> 01:19:14,004
I don't see a problem there.

1188
01:19:14,045 --> 01:19:15,839
Here I come!

1189
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,482
-Oh, my.
-Completely restored.

1190
01:19:34,524 --> 01:19:37,652
Only 7,000 for a new willy.

1191
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:41,030
It's so nice.

1192
01:19:41,072 --> 01:19:42,824
But, uh...

1193
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:45,493
William, you know
how the Lord feels...

1194
01:19:45,535 --> 01:19:48,371
about having men in hotel room.

1195
01:19:49,372 --> 01:19:50,331
even a man who has ordered...

1196
01:19:50,373 --> 01:19:52,333
champagne and oysters
from room service?

1197
01:19:58,047 --> 01:20:00,383
It's OK. I didn't
charge it to your room.

1198
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:03,761
I cannot anymore see you.

1199
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:06,889
Why on earth not?

1200
01:20:06,931 --> 01:20:08,933
Oh, let us leave at that.

1201
01:20:08,975 --> 01:20:10,184
Make pain less.

1202
01:20:10,184 --> 01:20:13,354
Good-bye forever.

1203
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:19,485
No, no. What is
this all about?

1204
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:27,284
" We regret to in form you
that your application...

1205
01:20:27,326 --> 01:20:30,621
" for permanent residence
has been denied.

1206
01:20:30,663 --> 01:20:34,166
" you must leave the country
no later than tomorrow."

1207
01:20:34,959 --> 01:20:38,963
I try everything, but is
very political red tape...

1208
01:20:39,004 --> 01:20:42,341
to get green card,
and I am loopholeless.

1209
01:20:43,843 --> 01:20:45,469
Well...

1210
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:46,762
this is horrible.

1211
01:20:48,222 --> 01:20:50,266
And to think I was going
to ask you to marry me.

1212
01:20:50,307 --> 01:20:52,017
Marry you?

1213
01:20:52,059 --> 01:20:54,812
Yes, yes, l, uh...

1214
01:20:54,853 --> 01:20:59,274
purchased a ring
and everything.

1215
01:21:00,192 --> 01:21:02,152
But with your leaving...

1216
01:21:03,153 --> 01:21:06,907
I am but ignorant,
unintelligible foreigner...

1217
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:10,411
but if you marry me,
I believe that puts, uh...

1218
01:21:10,452 --> 01:21:12,996
kibosh on deportation.

1219
01:21:13,038 --> 01:21:14,373
-Really?
-Yes.

1220
01:21:15,624 --> 01:21:16,708
Oh, Ulga...

1221
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:19,044
Ulga...

1222
01:21:19,086 --> 01:21:20,045
Will you--

1223
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:27,594
What? What?

1224
01:21:27,636 --> 01:21:32,266
-Marry me?
-Ohh...marry you?

1225
01:21:32,307 --> 01:21:34,935
Oh, is legal question.

1226
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:39,564
Yes, I will, is binding answer.

1227
01:21:46,822 --> 01:21:48,407
Leave me alone.

1228
01:21:48,448 --> 01:21:49,825
I'm engaged!

1229
01:21:49,825 --> 01:21:52,661
We're talking a settlement
of 20 million minimum!

1230
01:21:52,661 --> 01:21:54,788
Oh, we're finally
set for life, Darling!

1231
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:57,290
I just have time
for one quickwhoo!

1232
01:22:07,968 --> 01:22:11,137
-I said whoo.
-Why won't you talk to me?

1233
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:13,932
There's nothing to say.

1234
01:22:13,974 --> 01:22:16,267
I scared you when I told you
I loved you, didn't l?

1235
01:22:17,644 --> 01:22:19,938
Jack, there is no love.

1236
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:21,773
It's just a trick of
the brain...

1237
01:22:21,815 --> 01:22:24,776
a combination of
hormones and chemicals.

1238
01:22:24,818 --> 01:22:26,486
Then why are you here?

1239
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:32,283
Tell me to my face
you don't love me.

1240
01:22:32,325 --> 01:22:33,993
I don't love you.

1241
01:22:33,993 --> 01:22:38,164
Wow, that was more believable
than I thought it would be.

1242
01:22:46,005 --> 01:22:49,300
Look, I know I freaked you out
by moving too fast...

1243
01:22:49,342 --> 01:22:51,135
with all that
"I love you" stuff.

1244
01:22:51,177 --> 01:22:53,805
So, let's just...

1245
01:22:53,846 --> 01:22:54,972
get married.

1246
01:22:57,183 --> 01:22:58,518
I gotta go.

1247
01:23:09,946 --> 01:23:11,197
Oh!

1248
01:23:12,615 --> 01:23:14,700
That is jarring.

1249
01:23:14,742 --> 01:23:17,411
My love, tonight
we will celebrate...

1250
01:23:17,453 --> 01:23:20,248
this ecstatic joining
of our spirits...

1251
01:23:20,289 --> 01:23:21,582
with the union...

1252
01:23:23,334 --> 01:23:25,795
of our aching bodies.

1253
01:23:27,588 --> 01:23:30,091
Oh, you have
stomach cramp again.

1254
01:23:30,132 --> 01:23:31,926
No, no, no. I ache
for you, my pumpkin.

1255
01:23:31,967 --> 01:23:34,387
-Let's hump.
-Oh, William, my religion!

1256
01:23:34,428 --> 01:23:37,264
-Humping is not yet allowed.
-Oh, of course it is.

1257
01:23:37,306 --> 01:23:38,933
I proposed, you accepted.

1258
01:23:38,974 --> 01:23:41,268
To God, everything
else is just paper work.

1259
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:44,980
Oh, William, I insist
we wait till after wedding.

1260
01:23:45,022 --> 01:23:47,608
Ulga, I am much more
powerful than you.

1261
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:49,610
Just relax and enjoy it.

1262
01:24:04,792 --> 01:24:07,920
Oh, always something
in your mouth.

1263
01:24:11,799 --> 01:24:13,258
Are you dead?

1264
01:24:28,482 --> 01:24:29,983
Why me?!

1265
01:24:30,025 --> 01:24:33,237
Oh, wake up,
you disgusting shit!

1266
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:35,614
20 million.

1267
01:24:39,493 --> 01:24:41,954
-What?
-I need you here.

1268
01:24:47,793 --> 01:24:48,919
Wow.

1269
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,462
That's real attractive.

1270
01:24:50,462 --> 01:24:51,630
We gotta get him out of here...

1271
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:53,924
and make it look like
he died at his house, alone.

1272
01:24:55,008 --> 01:24:55,967
Room service.

1273
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:00,430
Let's get him to the bedroom.

1274
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:04,559
Ok...

1275
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:05,602
too far.

1276
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:08,271
Uh, balcony?

1277
01:25:13,318 --> 01:25:14,402
Oh, just--

1278
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:16,571
just hold him.
I'll be right back.

1279
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:27,499
Champagne and oysters.

1280
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:29,918
All this just for you?

1281
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:31,086
Oh, yes.

1282
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:32,754
I mean, someone is joining me.

1283
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:33,755
I'll open the champagne.

1284
01:25:33,797 --> 01:25:35,590
That's all right.
I'll take care of it.

1285
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:37,091
Thank you.
It's, uh...

1286
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:39,636
tip's included when
it's paid for, good night.

1287
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:46,100
Aah!

1288
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,274
I ask you to do
one simple thing.

1289
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:56,778
Oh, I don't consider holding
a 500-pound corpse simple.

1290
01:25:56,819 --> 01:25:58,279
Ok, if you hadn't
flung open the door--

1291
01:25:58,321 --> 01:25:59,947
I didn't fling it!

1292
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:02,283
Look, we just have to get
the body back to the house...

1293
01:26:02,283 --> 01:26:03,951
and everything will be fine.

1294
01:26:04,952 --> 01:26:06,204
Have you seen her?

1295
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:08,206
Dean.

1296
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:09,832
Shit!

1297
01:26:09,874 --> 01:26:10,917
Angela!

1298
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:12,543
I'll meet you by Tensy
in 5 minutes.

1299
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:14,754
-He looks really pissed.
-I'll handle him. Go!

1300
01:26:28,935 --> 01:26:29,936
Oh, god.

1301
01:26:30,937 --> 01:26:32,271
Angela, stop!

1302
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:39,278
I have missed you
so much! So much!

1303
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,571
I can't stop
thinking about you.

1304
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:41,906
I've never been so
in love with anybody...

1305
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,032
in my whole, entire life.

1306
01:26:43,074 --> 01:26:44,950
I'm begging you, please.

1307
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,077
Please, just give me
one more chance.

1308
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:49,121
One more chance.
Marry me again.

1309
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:50,581
What?

1310
01:26:50,623 --> 01:26:52,249
Get up.

1311
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:53,918
How'd you find me?

1312
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:55,252
The title for
the Mercedes came through.

1313
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:56,504
It listed this place
as your temporary address.

1314
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:58,756
I drove straight through
just so I could see you.

1315
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:01,091
Your hair's different.
It looks really pretty.

1316
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,593
I like it.
Come here, give me a kiss.

1317
01:27:02,635 --> 01:27:03,719
No.

1318
01:27:03,761 --> 01:27:05,220
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Angela, I've changed.

1319
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:06,555
I've totally changed.

1320
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:07,556
Look, look, look.

1321
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:08,807
This place is crawling
with prime trim.

1322
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:09,975
I'm barely even noticing.

1323
01:27:10,017 --> 01:27:12,227
I...can't deal
with this right now.

1324
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:13,729
No, no, no.
Angela, listen to me.

1325
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:15,064
I'm not leaving without you.

1326
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:16,231
I love you...

1327
01:27:16,273 --> 01:27:17,733
and I don't care
who hears it.

1328
01:27:17,775 --> 01:27:20,611
I love her. I love her.
I love her. I love her!

1329
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:21,612
What do you want
me to do?

1330
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,238
I--I'll sing.
You want me to sing?

1331
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,907
Come fly with me

1332
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:27,409
Come fly, come fly

1333
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:29,077
Shut up!

1334
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:31,455
What do you want, baby?
I'll do anything.

1335
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,291
Anything?

1336
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:38,295
I had no idea
you were into this stuff.

1337
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:44,259
I've been trying a lot
of new things lately.

1338
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:45,427
Oh, no, no.
Wait, wait.

1339
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,137
I don't know about that.

1340
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:49,931
Are you questioning me?

1341
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:52,434
No. No, no, no. It's just--

1342
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:55,979
Kiss my foot and apologize.

1343
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:00,067
I'm sorry.

1344
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:02,903
Good boy.

1345
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,574
Ooh, yes.

1346
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:16,416
Now, I'm just gonna
get some whipped cream.

1347
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,671
I got no problem with that.

1348
01:28:22,505 --> 01:28:24,924
I'll be right back.

1349
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,262
Hurry up.

1350
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:42,817
Careful, we don't want
any more damage to the body.

1351
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,194
Yeah.

1352
01:28:46,038 --> 01:28:46,997
Housekeeping!

1353
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:47,998
You want your bed
turned down?

1354
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:52,610
Housekeeping.

1355
01:28:56,739 --> 01:28:58,533
Look. I don't need anything.

1356
01:28:58,575 --> 01:28:59,909
Please, just get lost.

1357
01:29:01,661 --> 01:29:03,705
Lady!

1358
01:29:03,746 --> 01:29:05,540
You know,
I've been cleaning...

1359
01:29:05,581 --> 01:29:08,751
this room for 3 weeks,
and so far, no tip.

1360
01:29:08,793 --> 01:29:10,461
Fine. There's 20 bucks
in my pants over there.

1361
01:29:10,503 --> 01:29:11,713
20?

1362
01:29:11,754 --> 01:29:13,381
How about I sit
on your kinky face

1363
01:29:13,423 --> 01:29:15,216
for a while while
you think about that.

1364
01:29:15,258 --> 01:29:18,302
OK, OK, OK. 50!

1365
01:29:18,344 --> 01:29:20,179
That's more like it.

1366
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:22,640
Unbelievable.

1367
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:28,813
Both of these
wallets yours?

1368
01:29:30,314 --> 01:29:32,191
Two wallets?

1369
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:33,192
Untie me.

1370
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:35,528
Now, thatll be another 20.

1371
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:41,075
All right.
He's sleeping.

1372
01:29:41,117 --> 01:29:42,076
He wakes up having...

1373
01:29:42,118 --> 01:29:43,744
one of his famous
coughing fits...

1374
01:29:43,786 --> 01:29:46,580
flails around and falls
right onto the statue...

1375
01:29:46,622 --> 01:29:48,749
becoming penilely impaled.

1376
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:50,584
That's believable, right?

1377
01:29:50,626 --> 01:29:52,461
I just really need
a shower.

1378
01:29:54,588 --> 01:29:55,548
Where's the penis?

1379
01:29:55,589 --> 01:29:56,549
It's still there.

1380
01:29:56,549 --> 01:29:57,550
It's just the rigor
mortis is gone...

1381
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:58,592
so there's no wood.

1382
01:29:58,634 --> 01:30:00,928
Not his, the statue's.

1383
01:30:00,970 --> 01:30:01,929
Oh. It's still
in the car.

1384
01:30:01,971 --> 01:30:04,056
I'll get it.
There you go.

1385
01:30:39,424 --> 01:30:41,593
Oh, this is--

1386
01:30:42,636 --> 01:30:44,054
This is unbelievable.

1387
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:47,099
Oh. Oh, God.

1388
01:30:49,309 --> 01:30:52,521
Oh, God.
You are so enormous.

1389
01:30:52,563 --> 01:30:53,564
OK.

1390
01:30:55,315 --> 01:30:56,775
Oh, God, please.

1391
01:31:00,362 --> 01:31:02,280
You gold-digging whore.

1392
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,032
You're already working
someone else, huh?

1393
01:31:04,074 --> 01:31:05,534
Get off of her, asshole.

1394
01:31:05,575 --> 01:31:07,035
Get off, asshole.

1395
01:31:07,077 --> 01:31:09,329
-Don't shoot him, Dean.
-Why not?

1396
01:31:09,371 --> 01:31:10,872
Because he's already dead.

1397
01:31:12,416 --> 01:31:14,709
Oh, you are one sick slut.

1398
01:31:14,751 --> 01:31:18,004
I am not a sick slut.

1399
01:31:18,046 --> 01:31:20,382
One penis coming up, mom.

1400
01:31:20,423 --> 01:31:21,550
Wendy?

1401
01:31:21,591 --> 01:31:23,593
Uh, hello.

1402
01:31:25,971 --> 01:31:26,930
Mom?

1403
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:30,100
You're her mother?

1404
01:31:30,141 --> 01:31:32,018
It's just a nickname.

1405
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,812
Oh, my God.

1406
01:31:35,438 --> 01:31:37,732
Oh, my god.

1407
01:31:37,774 --> 01:31:38,900
You two played me.

1408
01:31:38,942 --> 01:31:41,403
Oh, no. No.

1409
01:31:41,444 --> 01:31:43,905
That whole marriage
was bullshit...

1410
01:31:43,947 --> 01:31:45,657
and this one you even offed!

1411
01:31:45,699 --> 01:31:47,575
We didn't off him.

1412
01:31:47,617 --> 01:31:50,620
He coughed himself
to death.

1413
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:51,204
Yeah, right.

1414
01:31:51,246 --> 01:31:53,832
You let your
own daughter seduce me?

1415
01:31:53,873 --> 01:31:56,417
Do you have any idea how much
therapy you people need?

1416
01:31:56,459 --> 01:31:58,670
Look, Dean.

1417
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:01,339
I don't blame you
for being upset.

1418
01:32:01,381 --> 01:32:03,049
We did an awful thing.

1419
01:32:03,091 --> 01:32:07,553
For the first time,
I feel really bad about it...

1420
01:32:07,637 --> 01:32:11,432
but maybe, despite
all this craziness...

1421
01:32:11,474 --> 01:32:14,102
there's still hope
for us after all?

1422
01:32:14,143 --> 01:32:16,312
There's more hope for you
and him than there is for us.

1423
01:32:16,354 --> 01:32:19,107
Dean, please
tell me it's OK.

1424
01:32:19,148 --> 01:32:20,650
I love you.

1425
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:21,776
Forget it.

1426
01:32:21,818 --> 01:32:22,819
Fine!

1427
01:32:22,819 --> 01:32:24,570
Look. You brought
this on yourself.

1428
01:32:24,612 --> 01:32:27,615
-You cheated on me.
-You set me up to cheat!

1429
01:32:27,657 --> 01:32:28,783
We can't make a scumbag...

1430
01:32:28,825 --> 01:32:30,451
do anything a scumbag
wouldn't do anyway.

1431
01:32:30,493 --> 01:32:32,912
Shut up, junior slut.
Get over there.

1432
01:32:34,497 --> 01:32:36,624
You know, you two
got some brass balls...

1433
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:38,251
in those panties,
I'll give you that.

1434
01:32:39,585 --> 01:32:42,797
In the few moments
you have left...

1435
01:32:42,838 --> 01:32:46,717
Ii want to see some begging
and some pleading.

1436
01:32:46,759 --> 01:32:49,470
Uh, Mom?

1437
01:32:49,512 --> 01:32:53,849
Dean, you got so many tells.

1438
01:32:53,849 --> 01:32:56,644
You are not the killing type.

1439
01:32:56,686 --> 01:32:59,313
Don't screw with me.
I'm on a fine edge here.

1440
01:32:59,355 --> 01:33:00,689
Don't!

1441
01:33:03,317 --> 01:33:05,778
See? No bullets.

1442
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:08,614
Fine. So I'm not
that big on homicide...

1443
01:33:08,656 --> 01:33:10,115
but I could do worse.

1444
01:33:10,157 --> 01:33:13,452
I found all your l.D.s,
all your aliases...

1445
01:33:13,494 --> 01:33:14,620
and I'm gonna
get them to the cops...

1446
01:33:14,662 --> 01:33:17,289
when they start investigating
decomposing boy, here.

1447
01:33:17,331 --> 01:33:20,417
You two are gonna dry up
in some filthy lesbo lockdown...

1448
01:33:20,459 --> 01:33:21,961
with bad lighting!

1449
01:33:23,295 --> 01:33:25,297
I don't have to kill you
to kill you.

1450
01:33:25,339 --> 01:33:27,091
No.

1451
01:33:27,132 --> 01:33:29,510
Dean, wait!

1452
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:31,679
Look. What if we gave
you back your money?

1453
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:35,057
Well?

1454
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:37,893
I stopped walking, didn't l?

1455
01:33:37,935 --> 01:33:39,478
But first
you got to help us...

1456
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,480
make it look like
this creep died here...

1457
01:33:41,522 --> 01:33:42,981
alone and peaceful...

1458
01:33:43,023 --> 01:33:44,817
so there's no questions.

1459
01:33:44,858 --> 01:33:45,984
You know how to do that?

1460
01:33:46,026 --> 01:33:47,194
I'm from Jersey, aren't l?

1461
01:33:49,863 --> 01:33:53,283
Boy, Dean was really
incredible with that body.

1462
01:33:53,325 --> 01:33:57,037
Well, are you gonna
let me in on the play?

1463
01:33:57,079 --> 01:33:58,163
What play?

1464
01:33:58,205 --> 01:34:00,332
You promised
that mook 300,000.

1465
01:34:00,374 --> 01:34:01,667
When we take him
to the bank tomorrow...

1466
01:34:01,708 --> 01:34:05,253
we're only gonna be,
oh, about300,000 short.

1467
01:34:05,295 --> 01:34:07,839
-The money will be there.
-What?

1468
01:34:07,881 --> 01:34:09,925
I don't want a big
scene about this, Page...

1469
01:34:09,966 --> 01:34:12,260
but Mrs. Vogal from the l.R.S.

1470
01:34:12,302 --> 01:34:14,888
Was more of a "protecting you
from making the worst mistake...

1471
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:16,223
of your life" thing
than it was...

1472
01:34:16,264 --> 01:34:19,351
a "the government came
and took all our money" thing.

1473
01:34:20,435 --> 01:34:23,438
-What?
-I pulled a tiny little con...

1474
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:24,940
to keep you from leaving.

1475
01:34:24,981 --> 01:34:27,651
Oh, you bitch!
You bitch!

1476
01:34:27,692 --> 01:34:29,945
Hey, look, wait!

1477
01:34:29,986 --> 01:34:32,447
Stop it.
You're gonna kill us!

1478
01:34:32,489 --> 01:34:33,657
Stop it!

1479
01:34:36,826 --> 01:34:40,121
There seems to be a problem with
your account, Ms. Conners.

1480
01:34:40,163 --> 01:34:42,123
It was closed yesterday.

1481
01:34:42,165 --> 01:34:44,626
That's impossible.

1482
01:34:44,668 --> 01:34:45,627
What the hell is going on?

1483
01:34:45,669 --> 01:34:47,128
Nothing, I swear.

1484
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:49,005
Here's the signature.

1485
01:34:52,509 --> 01:34:53,718
Barbara.

1486
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,805
Wait!

1487
01:34:56,846 --> 01:34:59,390
I gave my old partner
all my account numbers...

1488
01:34:59,432 --> 01:35:00,642
for the I.R.S. Scam...

1489
01:35:00,683 --> 01:35:03,603
and that hag ripped off
every penny we ever stole!

1490
01:35:03,645 --> 01:35:05,438
Tell your fairy tales
to your cellmates.

1491
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,774
Look. For once,
she's telling the truth.

1492
01:35:07,815 --> 01:35:09,484
And I'm gonna believe
the seed of Satan?

1493
01:35:09,526 --> 01:35:12,070
Skank, give me
the keys to my car.

1494
01:35:12,153 --> 01:35:13,279
Give me the keys
to the Mercedes.

1495
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:15,281
That's it.
Good-bye.

1496
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:19,953
I can't believe it.

1497
01:35:19,994 --> 01:35:21,079
I can't believe this.

1498
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,289
I've blown both our lives.

1499
01:35:23,289 --> 01:35:25,291
I'm sorry, Page.

1500
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:27,043
I'm a terrible person.

1501
01:35:27,085 --> 01:35:28,795
I'm a terrible mother.

1502
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:32,632
I'm a terrible everything.

1503
01:35:42,183 --> 01:35:44,519
You're finally
seeing things clearly.

1504
01:35:55,529 --> 01:35:56,822
What the hell
are you doing?

1505
01:35:58,532 --> 01:35:59,492
You want money?

1506
01:35:59,533 --> 01:36:03,120
The guy who wants to marry me is
worth 1.5 in a divorce.

1507
01:36:27,478 --> 01:36:29,271
She's just gonna
screw with him again.

1508
01:36:29,313 --> 01:36:30,648
Hugely.

1509
01:36:32,149 --> 01:36:33,275
I'm sorry.
I was just wondering...

1510
01:36:33,317 --> 01:36:35,152
how long you're
gonna stay this time.

1511
01:36:35,194 --> 01:36:36,153
Look.

1512
01:36:36,195 --> 01:36:37,780
I know that
I've been horrible...

1513
01:36:37,821 --> 01:36:40,366
but all this talk
about love and marriage...

1514
01:36:40,407 --> 01:36:43,577
it can make anyone act freaky.

1515
01:36:43,619 --> 01:36:48,123
I know that I must seem
like a mean, selfish bitch...

1516
01:36:48,165 --> 01:36:50,459
No, you seem like
the sweetest...

1517
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:52,795
most wonderful person
I've ever met.

1518
01:36:53,879 --> 01:36:55,339
What a moron.

1519
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,467
Friends...

1520
01:36:58,509 --> 01:36:59,968
employees...

1521
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:02,095
beer wholesaler...

1522
01:37:02,137 --> 01:37:03,764
I have an announcement.

1523
01:37:05,265 --> 01:37:07,392
Jane and I
are getting married.

1524
01:37:09,645 --> 01:37:11,438
That is awesome!

1525
01:37:11,438 --> 01:37:12,439
Yeah!

1526
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:15,650
Jane, come here.

1527
01:37:15,692 --> 01:37:19,404
So, uh, Jack,
now that you have some, uh...

1528
01:37:19,446 --> 01:37:21,448
extra responsibilities,
that doesn't mean...

1529
01:37:21,448 --> 01:37:23,909
you're gonna change your mind
and sell this place, does it?

1530
01:37:23,909 --> 01:37:25,869
No, well do just fine.

1531
01:37:28,622 --> 01:37:29,623
Thanks, man.

1532
01:37:32,292 --> 01:37:33,585
Sell what, honey?

1533
01:37:33,627 --> 01:37:35,420
Oh, nothing.
Just some guys offered me...

1534
01:37:35,462 --> 01:37:37,172
3 million for the bar
and the land.

1535
01:37:37,214 --> 01:37:38,173
3 million?

1536
01:37:38,215 --> 01:37:40,133
That sounds like something.

1537
01:37:40,175 --> 01:37:43,136
Well, yeah,
but this place was my dad's.

1538
01:37:43,136 --> 01:37:44,763
You know, it's home.

1539
01:37:44,804 --> 01:37:45,805
It's too late, anyway.

1540
01:37:45,805 --> 01:37:47,015
They got another lot
down the road.

1541
01:37:53,146 --> 01:37:54,647
There's no money.
I'm bailing.

1542
01:37:54,689 --> 01:37:55,774
No. Wait!
You can still get...

1543
01:37:55,815 --> 01:37:57,567
a decent settlement
out of this guy.

1544
01:37:57,609 --> 01:37:58,610
He'll lose the bar.

1545
01:37:58,651 --> 01:38:00,236
This is wrong.
It's over.

1546
01:38:00,278 --> 01:38:01,446
What the hell
is your daughter doing...

1547
01:38:01,488 --> 01:38:02,781
growing a conscience
on my score?

1548
01:38:02,822 --> 01:38:04,073
Don't make her do this.

1549
01:38:04,115 --> 01:38:05,992
I'll figure a way
to get you your money.

1550
01:38:06,034 --> 01:38:07,577
No. I'm tired of waiting.
We're doing it.

1551
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:11,080
May I have this dance?

1552
01:38:11,122 --> 01:38:13,416
I--Jack.

1553
01:38:14,417 --> 01:38:15,376
Uh-oh.

1554
01:38:15,418 --> 01:38:17,921
-You gotta go.
-I gotta go.

1555
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:25,386
Is that who
I think it is?

1556
01:38:25,428 --> 01:38:26,387
Jane!

1557
01:38:26,429 --> 01:38:28,431
It is. How are you, darling?

1558
01:38:28,473 --> 01:38:29,932
Pissed off.

1559
01:38:29,974 --> 01:38:31,601
We were just on our way
to see you at the hotel...

1560
01:38:31,642 --> 01:38:32,602
but we thought
we'd stop by here...

1561
01:38:32,643 --> 01:38:33,603
for a drink.

1562
01:38:33,644 --> 01:38:35,063
Hi.

1563
01:38:35,104 --> 01:38:36,939
This isnt Jack, is it?

1564
01:38:36,981 --> 01:38:39,442
Jane is always going
on and on about you.

1565
01:38:39,484 --> 01:38:41,444
I think she's in love!

1566
01:38:41,486 --> 01:38:44,113
I'm Betty,
Jane's second cousin...

1567
01:38:44,155 --> 01:38:46,324
and this is my brother.

1568
01:38:46,365 --> 01:38:48,284
Vinny--Vinny Staggliano.

1569
01:38:48,326 --> 01:38:51,120
I'm afraid you caught us
at a weird time.

1570
01:38:51,162 --> 01:38:53,497
I just asked Jane
to marry me, and--

1571
01:38:53,497 --> 01:38:54,957
Oh! That's great!

1572
01:38:54,999 --> 01:38:56,292
Congratulations.

1573
01:38:56,334 --> 01:38:58,461
Actually, I think she's having
second thoughts.

1574
01:38:58,502 --> 01:39:00,463
That's just the way our Jane is.

1575
01:39:00,504 --> 01:39:01,797
Yeah, but she gets
over it, though...

1576
01:39:01,839 --> 01:39:04,467
especially now that family's
here to give her a little shove.

1577
01:39:04,508 --> 01:39:05,468
Come on, you two...

1578
01:39:05,509 --> 01:39:06,635
why don't you
kiss and make up?

1579
01:39:06,677 --> 01:39:09,305
-I'm not really in the mood.
-Go on. Kiss.

1580
01:39:09,347 --> 01:39:12,058
That's nice.
There you go.

1581
01:39:13,851 --> 01:39:16,145
I think your relatives
are gonna like Bill's boat.

1582
01:39:16,187 --> 01:39:18,105
Who cares what they like?

1583
01:39:18,147 --> 01:39:19,523
Nice boat.

1584
01:39:24,195 --> 01:39:27,156
Ooh! Oh, oh!

1585
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:28,657
I'm so sorry.

1586
01:39:28,699 --> 01:39:30,159
I'm so clumsy.

1587
01:39:32,036 --> 01:39:33,120
That's OK.

1588
01:39:34,246 --> 01:39:35,998
How you doing, Skippy?

1589
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,166
Hey.

1590
01:39:37,207 --> 01:39:38,500
Hey, you.

1591
01:39:38,542 --> 01:39:40,669
I got the lotion.

1592
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:42,588
Who's got the hands?

1593
01:39:42,629 --> 01:39:43,839
Don't look at me.

1594
01:39:43,881 --> 01:39:45,341
I don't like getting
all gunky.

1595
01:39:45,382 --> 01:39:48,510
Jack, would you mind?

1596
01:39:48,552 --> 01:39:49,511
Sure.

1597
01:39:52,556 --> 01:39:56,518
You are the most kind,
wonderful man.

1598
01:39:58,812 --> 01:40:00,731
Look at all the fish!

1599
01:40:06,945 --> 01:40:08,280
Got it.

1600
01:40:08,322 --> 01:40:09,573
This is gonna be a fun trip.

1601
01:40:15,662 --> 01:40:16,955
I honestly don't know why...

1602
01:40:16,997 --> 01:40:19,291
you'd want to wear
an off-the-shoulder.

1603
01:40:19,333 --> 01:40:21,209
This is what I want,
and it looks fine.

1604
01:40:21,251 --> 01:40:23,462
Fine.
What would I know?

1605
01:40:23,503 --> 01:40:26,798
I've only been married
13 times.

1606
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,009
All right, I'm coming out.
You better be nice.

1607
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:30,844
I'm always nice.

1608
01:40:40,145 --> 01:40:41,146
What's wrong?

1609
01:40:43,523 --> 01:40:45,191
Nothing.

1610
01:40:45,233 --> 01:40:47,485
Fine. If you're
gonna be sarcastic.

1611
01:40:47,527 --> 01:40:49,988
I'm not being sarcastic.

1612
01:40:52,198 --> 01:40:53,700
It's perfect.

1613
01:40:53,742 --> 01:40:55,327
Really?

1614
01:40:55,368 --> 01:40:57,370
There's nothing
you would change?

1615
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:00,081
Not a thing.

1616
01:41:00,123 --> 01:41:01,875
Oh, my god.

1617
01:41:01,916 --> 01:41:03,126
Well, I might just...

1618
01:41:03,168 --> 01:41:06,129
see what it looks like
without this in here.

1619
01:41:07,756 --> 01:41:09,007
I take it back.

1620
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:14,471
No. No.
I...like that idea.

1621
01:41:14,512 --> 01:41:15,597
So...

1622
01:41:15,638 --> 01:41:17,015
Mother likes it?

1623
01:41:17,056 --> 01:41:19,559
-Oh, I'm not...
-she's not my mother.

1624
01:41:39,996 --> 01:41:41,581
You really are good at this.

1625
01:41:41,622 --> 01:41:43,082
I'm almost buying it.

1626
01:41:43,124 --> 01:41:44,625
Ladies and gentlemen...

1627
01:41:44,667 --> 01:41:46,502
friends and family...

1628
01:41:46,544 --> 01:41:48,171
we have come here today...

1629
01:41:48,212 --> 01:41:51,007
to celebrate
two wonderful people...

1630
01:41:51,048 --> 01:41:53,176
who have managed
to find each other...

1631
01:41:53,176 --> 01:41:56,512
in this sometimes
seemingly cold world...

1632
01:41:56,554 --> 01:41:58,264
and pledge their hearts.

1633
01:42:00,016 --> 01:42:02,018
Do you, Jack Withrowe...

1634
01:42:02,059 --> 01:42:04,979
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife...

1635
01:42:05,021 --> 01:42:07,606
to love her, honor her,
and cherish her...

1636
01:42:07,648 --> 01:42:09,442
until death do you part?

1637
01:42:09,483 --> 01:42:11,444
I do.

1638
01:42:11,485 --> 01:42:14,030
And do you, Jane Helstrom...

1639
01:42:14,071 --> 01:42:17,116
take this man to be your
lawful wedded husband...

1640
01:42:17,158 --> 01:42:19,827
to love, honor,
and to cherish him...

1641
01:42:19,869 --> 01:42:22,621
until death do you part?

1642
01:42:25,749 --> 01:42:27,376
I do.

1643
01:42:28,377 --> 01:42:29,628
What?

1644
01:42:32,464 --> 01:42:34,133
I do.

1645
01:42:35,593 --> 01:42:37,845
I now pronounce you
husband and wife...

1646
01:42:37,887 --> 01:42:39,305
and you may kiss the bride.

1647
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:48,314
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you...

1648
01:42:48,355 --> 01:42:50,149
-Mr. And Mrs. Withrowe.
-Shut up.

1649
01:42:51,275 --> 01:42:55,571
Wise men say

1650
01:42:56,613 --> 01:43:01,493
Only fools rush in

1651
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:08,292
But I can't help

1652
01:43:08,333 --> 01:43:14,089
Falling in love with you...

1653
01:43:15,132 --> 01:43:16,091
Here.

1654
01:43:16,133 --> 01:43:17,968
Make sure he sees
you drinking a lot.

1655
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:19,219
That won't be hard.

1656
01:43:22,347 --> 01:43:25,684
There's my wonderful new
daughter-in-law.

1657
01:43:25,726 --> 01:43:27,352
Are you avoiding me?

1658
01:43:27,394 --> 01:43:28,645
Uh, no.

1659
01:43:28,687 --> 01:43:30,647
I gotta go.

1660
01:43:32,441 --> 01:43:33,942
Don't let it bother you.

1661
01:43:33,984 --> 01:43:36,611
She's shyer than shit.

1662
01:43:36,653 --> 01:43:39,865
Uh, what is it you do,
Mr. Staggliano?

1663
01:43:41,366 --> 01:43:43,326
College professor.

1664
01:43:44,327 --> 01:43:46,121
Uh, what do you teach?

1665
01:43:47,330 --> 01:43:48,540
College stuff.

1666
01:43:48,582 --> 01:43:50,667
What are you,
a fucking cop?

1667
01:43:50,709 --> 01:43:53,128
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1668
01:43:55,255 --> 01:43:56,965
I'll only need 30 minutes.

1669
01:43:57,007 --> 01:43:59,759
It won't work.
He loves me too much.

1670
01:43:59,801 --> 01:44:02,262
Men don't turn women down.

1671
01:44:22,157 --> 01:44:25,034
Just like our first date,
only less mud.

1672
01:44:25,076 --> 01:44:26,995
It's beautiful.

1673
01:44:33,626 --> 01:44:34,669
Happy?

1674
01:44:38,548 --> 01:44:40,758
Always know just
the right thing to say.

1675
01:44:41,759 --> 01:44:43,386
I love you...

1676
01:44:43,428 --> 01:44:44,554
Jack.

1677
01:44:44,595 --> 01:44:47,932
I love you very much.

1678
01:44:47,974 --> 01:44:49,976
You're different, aren't you?

1679
01:44:50,059 --> 01:44:53,229
I mean, you would never let
anything ruin this, would you?

1680
01:44:53,271 --> 01:44:56,816
Well, sometimes these hotel
soaps irritate my skin.

1681
01:44:57,859 --> 01:44:59,527
I'm serious.

1682
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:04,323
Say nothing will ruin us.

1683
01:45:05,324 --> 01:45:07,034
Nothing will ever
take me away...

1684
01:45:07,076 --> 01:45:09,161
or keep me
from loving you.

1685
01:45:19,296 --> 01:45:21,841
Can I have some water?

1686
01:45:21,882 --> 01:45:23,634
I think I drank
too much champagne.

1687
01:46:24,319 --> 01:46:26,613
What are you doing
out here alone?

1688
01:46:26,613 --> 01:46:30,784
Oh, my wife celebrated herself
into an early coma.

1689
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:32,119
Oh.

1690
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:35,122
Well, her loss is my gain.

1691
01:46:35,163 --> 01:46:36,790
Walk me to my room.

1692
01:46:36,832 --> 01:46:38,291
I have a wedding gift
for you.

1693
01:46:38,333 --> 01:46:40,127
Oh, no, thats ok.
I was just gonna--

1694
01:46:40,168 --> 01:46:41,128
Oh, come on.

1695
01:46:41,169 --> 01:46:43,630
You can't turn down
a wedding gift, you know.

1696
01:46:43,672 --> 01:46:44,965
It's bad luck.

1697
01:46:44,965 --> 01:46:46,967
-I never heard that.
-Sure.

1698
01:46:47,008 --> 01:46:49,803
Everything to do with
weddings is bad luck.

1699
01:46:56,643 --> 01:46:59,145
Uh, I can only stay
a minute.

1700
01:47:00,146 --> 01:47:02,649
Will you just
relax?

1701
01:47:02,691 --> 01:47:04,943
OK? Sit down.

1702
01:47:08,446 --> 01:47:10,240
This hotel is so nice.

1703
01:47:10,281 --> 01:47:12,075
I'm so glad
my brother and I

1704
01:47:12,117 --> 01:47:13,743
decided to stay here,too.

1705
01:47:13,785 --> 01:47:15,745
Uh...yeah.

1706
01:47:15,787 --> 01:47:17,747
It's...

1707
01:47:17,789 --> 01:47:20,959
you, uh--ahem--mentioned
something about a gift?

1708
01:47:23,461 --> 01:47:26,214
You're so greedy.

1709
01:47:26,256 --> 01:47:30,802
But I happen to have it
right...here.

1710
01:47:34,806 --> 01:47:37,934
Cognac! Huh! Wow!

1711
01:47:37,976 --> 01:47:40,395
80 years old.

1712
01:47:40,436 --> 01:47:41,771
Uh, Jane is gonna love this.

1713
01:47:41,813 --> 01:47:43,106
Thank you so much.

1714
01:47:43,147 --> 01:47:46,067
Oh, oh, oh--
can't we just try some?

1715
01:47:46,109 --> 01:47:47,819
Please?

1716
01:47:54,992 --> 01:47:57,328
I thought you might not
want to wait alone.

1717
01:47:59,497 --> 01:48:01,624
Could be wrong. Oh!

1718
01:48:01,666 --> 01:48:03,876
It feels good going down,
doesn't it?

1719
01:48:03,918 --> 01:48:07,088
It's, uh...
it's really good.

1720
01:48:20,434 --> 01:48:22,061
No, thanks. I, uh...

1721
01:48:22,103 --> 01:48:23,729
I should be
getting back to Jane.

1722
01:48:23,771 --> 01:48:25,898
Jack, she's asleep.

1723
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:27,566
OK? Come on.

1724
01:48:27,608 --> 01:48:28,943
You deserve to have...

1725
01:48:28,943 --> 01:48:31,237
a little bit of fun
on your wedding night.

1726
01:48:31,278 --> 01:48:32,947
It's just fruit.

1727
01:48:41,038 --> 01:48:42,581
It's just a waste of time.

1728
01:48:42,623 --> 01:48:45,584
He's just gonna throw her out
on her ass.

1729
01:48:45,626 --> 01:48:47,378
I'm not worried.

1730
01:48:47,419 --> 01:48:50,130
Is that why you're
melting down the remote?

1731
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,301
Cute.

1732
01:49:06,813 --> 01:49:09,441
You've got a tiny bit
of cream...

1733
01:49:11,026 --> 01:49:12,360
right...

1734
01:49:24,205 --> 01:49:27,292
-I got to go.
-Oh, oh, oh. Why?

1735
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:29,627
-I just can't do this.
-What's the matter?

1736
01:49:29,669 --> 01:49:34,466
Is it because you don't
find me attractive?

1737
01:49:34,507 --> 01:49:38,303
No, no. A part of me
is very, very interested...

1738
01:49:38,344 --> 01:49:40,138
but the other parts
are yelling...

1739
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:41,806
" You just married her cousin."

1740
01:49:41,848 --> 01:49:44,434
Jane would never know,
I promise.

1741
01:49:44,517 --> 01:49:46,352
Yeah, but I would.

1742
01:49:46,352 --> 01:49:50,064
I could never do that
to someone I love.

1743
01:49:53,359 --> 01:49:55,653
You really do love her,
don't you?

1744
01:49:55,653 --> 01:49:57,322
Yeah...

1745
01:49:57,363 --> 01:49:59,824
and I really should be
getting back.

1746
01:49:59,866 --> 01:50:01,826
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

1747
01:50:01,868 --> 01:50:03,786
I feel terrible.
Please don't leave like this.

1748
01:50:03,828 --> 01:50:05,455
Can't we just, you know...

1749
01:50:05,496 --> 01:50:07,957
have a make-up drink
or something?

1750
01:50:07,999 --> 01:50:10,001
I'll be good, I promise.

1751
01:50:12,336 --> 01:50:13,462
Please?

1752
01:50:21,512 --> 01:50:23,472
That's it.
I'm going over there.

1753
01:50:23,514 --> 01:50:24,807
No. It isn't time yet.

1754
01:50:24,849 --> 01:50:26,142
I don't care,
you sick shit.

1755
01:50:26,183 --> 01:50:27,727
I can't do this to him.

1756
01:50:27,768 --> 01:50:28,978
You see? It hurts
when you screw around...

1757
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:30,229
with people's feelings,
doesn't it?

1758
01:50:30,271 --> 01:50:31,689
Not as much as this.

1759
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,660
Oh, my God.

1760
01:50:44,702 --> 01:50:46,620
Jane!

1761
01:50:46,662 --> 01:50:47,872
What?

1762
01:50:50,124 --> 01:50:51,292
I'm sorry.

1763
01:50:57,214 --> 01:50:59,008
While we are willing to admit...

1764
01:50:59,049 --> 01:51:02,011
some wrong doing on
the part of my client...

1765
01:51:02,052 --> 01:51:05,097
given the extremely short
duration of the marriage--

1766
01:51:05,139 --> 01:51:06,265
No negotiation.

1767
01:51:06,307 --> 01:51:08,475
Give her whatever she wants.

1768
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:12,104
We talked about
you not saying that.

1769
01:51:12,146 --> 01:51:14,231
Give her
whatever she wants.

1770
01:51:24,616 --> 01:51:26,285
I don't know what happened.

1771
01:51:26,326 --> 01:51:27,619
It was weird.

1772
01:51:27,661 --> 01:51:29,663
There is only one man
in the world.

1773
01:51:42,342 --> 01:51:44,636
What the hell
is taking so long?

1774
01:51:44,678 --> 01:51:46,638
Oh, relax.
You'll get your money.

1775
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:49,307
You destroyed my daughter,
but you'll get it.

1776
01:51:49,349 --> 01:51:51,977
Hey, I was standing around
minding my own business...

1777
01:51:52,019 --> 01:51:53,979
when you bitches came along
and ripped out my heart...

1778
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:55,313
for a game of hacky sack.

1779
01:51:55,355 --> 01:51:57,065
-Don't give me that.
-Come off it.

1780
01:51:57,107 --> 01:51:59,651
We're both the same--scum.

1781
01:51:59,693 --> 01:52:01,319
We are not the same.

1782
01:52:01,361 --> 01:52:04,281
I wasn't lying
when I said " I do."

1783
01:52:04,281 --> 01:52:07,117
No, you were lying
when you tried to nail Page.

1784
01:52:07,159 --> 01:52:10,787
Look. Where I come from,
guys make mistakes sometimes.

1785
01:52:10,829 --> 01:52:13,415
Didn't change the fact
that I loved you.

1786
01:52:15,667 --> 01:52:17,502
I just know
I wouldn't do it again.

1787
01:52:17,544 --> 01:52:21,840
-Because you got caught.
-No, because of what I lost.

1788
01:52:22,924 --> 01:52:25,802
I'm not the only guy in the
world that's ever screwed up.

1789
01:52:26,553 --> 01:52:27,804
Even a goody-goody like Jack

1790
01:52:27,846 --> 01:52:29,806
can't keep his wang
in the hangar.

1791
01:52:29,848 --> 01:52:32,726
-Yes, he can.
-What did you say?

1792
01:52:32,767 --> 01:52:33,852
Nothing.

1793
01:52:33,893 --> 01:52:35,103
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1794
01:52:35,145 --> 01:52:36,646
What did you say?

1795
01:52:37,856 --> 01:52:39,315
I micked him.

1796
01:52:40,650 --> 01:52:42,110
Stryctotoxy...

1797
01:52:42,152 --> 01:52:43,820
somewhere
bet ween out and awake.

1798
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:44,988
It just makes people
easy to handle.

1799
01:52:45,029 --> 01:52:46,990
Whoa. Wait a minute.
You're kidding.

1800
01:52:46,990 --> 01:52:49,659
He said no, and you still
let her believe...

1801
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:50,994
that he went for a soil sample?

1802
01:52:51,035 --> 01:52:53,621
You know what?
That's a new low, even for you.

1803
01:52:53,663 --> 01:52:55,623
Look. You wanted your money.

1804
01:52:55,707 --> 01:52:57,292
What was I supposed to do...

1805
01:52:57,375 --> 01:52:59,335
tell her the man
you forced us to con...

1806
01:52:59,377 --> 01:53:01,337
was the only decent guy
she ever met?

1807
01:53:01,379 --> 01:53:03,089
But you know what?
This is just too sick.

1808
01:53:03,131 --> 01:53:05,133
I thought this whole revenge
thing was gonna be fun...

1809
01:53:05,174 --> 01:53:07,093
but you've done everything
you can to ruin it.

1810
01:53:07,135 --> 01:53:08,553
I don't even want
this guy's money now.

1811
01:53:08,594 --> 01:53:10,555
-Well, I don't want it, either.
-Well, I'm not taking it!

1812
01:53:10,596 --> 01:53:12,557
-Well, neither am l!
-Well, neither am l!

1813
01:53:12,598 --> 01:53:14,475
-All right, I'll take it.
-What?!

1814
01:53:14,517 --> 01:53:15,726
You said
you didn't want it.

1815
01:53:15,768 --> 01:53:17,687
You should tell
your daughter the truth.

1816
01:53:17,728 --> 01:53:20,773
What for? He's only gonna
end up hurting her anyway.

1817
01:53:20,815 --> 01:53:23,109
She's better off with me, OK?

1818
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:24,277
I'll protect her.

1819
01:53:24,318 --> 01:53:26,445
From what?
From love?

1820
01:53:26,487 --> 01:53:27,780
From pain.

1821
01:53:27,822 --> 01:53:29,782
Love is pain.
Life is pain.

1822
01:53:29,824 --> 01:53:31,784
You can't protect
anybody from it.

1823
01:53:31,826 --> 01:53:33,452
It's always gonna get you.

1824
01:53:33,494 --> 01:53:35,579
But sometimes,
life can also be good.

1825
01:53:35,621 --> 01:53:37,957
But you got to be open.
You got to take chances.

1826
01:53:37,999 --> 01:53:39,583
You got to let go.

1827
01:53:39,625 --> 01:53:41,961
What self-help guru moron
taught you that?

1828
01:53:42,003 --> 01:53:43,796
Nobody had
to teach me nothing.

1829
01:53:43,838 --> 01:53:44,964
It's common sense.

1830
01:53:45,005 --> 01:53:46,716
And Deepak Chopra
is not a moron.

1831
01:53:46,757 --> 01:53:48,801
I've seen a lot
of crap in my life...

1832
01:53:48,843 --> 01:53:50,803
but the way you're cheating
her out of any chance...

1833
01:53:50,845 --> 01:53:52,972
for a decent future
really sucks.

1834
01:53:53,889 --> 01:53:55,391
Of all the lousy things
you've done...

1835
01:53:55,432 --> 01:53:57,393
you should be most
ashamed of that.

1836
01:53:57,434 --> 01:53:58,686
And what you did to me, too--

1837
01:53:58,727 --> 01:54:00,938
--I don't want to completely
leave that out.

1838
01:54:01,605 --> 01:54:03,148
-Here's your money.
-I don't want the money.

1839
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:05,109
Good luck with
psycho mom here.

1840
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:07,570
-What was that?
-I took care of it.

1841
01:54:07,611 --> 01:54:10,072
-How?
-I don't want to talk about it.

1842
01:54:10,114 --> 01:54:11,699
Let's just get out
of this goddamn place.

1843
01:54:12,741 --> 01:54:13,826
So...

1844
01:54:13,867 --> 01:54:16,870
where are we going--
Seattle or San Francisco?

1845
01:54:17,955 --> 01:54:19,957
You know, you don't
have to stay with me.

1846
01:54:19,957 --> 01:54:22,960
There's plenty of money for
you to set up on your own...

1847
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,461
and you can have
all of it.

1848
01:54:24,503 --> 01:54:26,255
Thanks, mom.

1849
01:54:26,296 --> 01:54:28,298
You're the only person
in this world...

1850
01:54:28,298 --> 01:54:29,633
I even half-trust.

1851
01:54:36,515 --> 01:54:38,809
-What are you doing?
-Turning around.

1852
01:54:38,809 --> 01:54:39,851
Why?

1853
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:44,189
-Promise you won't attack me?
-What is it?

1854
01:54:44,231 --> 01:54:45,649
We're traveling
at high speeds.

1855
01:54:45,649 --> 01:54:47,025
It would endanger
both our lives.

1856
01:54:47,067 --> 01:54:48,318
What is it?

1857
01:54:50,988 --> 01:54:53,949
Jack turned me down...

1858
01:54:53,991 --> 01:54:58,495
so I kind of...
I micked him.

1859
01:55:08,130 --> 01:55:11,258
Oh, you are the most evil,
manipulative--

1860
01:55:11,299 --> 01:55:13,593
You're right. I am.

1861
01:55:13,635 --> 01:55:16,263
I've just been so afraid
of losing you...

1862
01:55:16,304 --> 01:55:18,598
or of you getting hurt
like me.

1863
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,267
But I can't protect you.

1864
01:55:20,308 --> 01:55:23,270
I just get you hurt
in different, sickways.

1865
01:55:23,311 --> 01:55:24,938
So you might as well get hurt...

1866
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:26,940
in your own healthy,
normal ways--

1867
01:55:26,982 --> 01:55:28,608
ways you come up with
on your own...

1868
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:30,652
and can't blame me for.

1869
01:55:40,495 --> 01:55:44,165
Oh, it's a hug.
I can pull over for a hug.

1870
01:55:52,006 --> 01:55:53,800
Now, don't cry too much.
You'll look like hell...

1871
01:55:53,841 --> 01:55:55,802
when you go back to him, OK?

1872
01:55:55,843 --> 01:55:58,054
You should wear
the blue dress.

1873
01:55:58,096 --> 01:56:00,056
Mom...

1874
01:56:01,182 --> 01:56:03,768
Right.
Wear whatever you want...

1875
01:56:05,269 --> 01:56:07,146
except what you're wearing.

1876
01:56:22,245 --> 01:56:23,788
What are you doing here?

1877
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:26,207
You know what I'm doing here.

1878
01:56:26,249 --> 01:56:27,583
What, you thought
I'd still want you...

1879
01:56:27,625 --> 01:56:28,584
after what you did to me?

1880
01:56:28,626 --> 01:56:30,503
You don't? OK. Fine.

1881
01:56:30,545 --> 01:56:33,089
All right, wait, wait.
OK. OK. Fine.

1882
01:56:33,130 --> 01:56:36,968
-So I still want you.
-No kidding.

1883
01:56:40,221 --> 01:56:42,932
But don't you ever
cheat on me again.

1884
01:56:42,974 --> 01:56:45,518
-Ever. Ever!
-OK. Fine!

1885
01:56:45,559 --> 01:56:46,560
I mean it.

1886
01:56:46,602 --> 01:56:47,603
Because if one day...

1887
01:56:47,645 --> 01:56:49,105
you happen to notice
some gorgeous girl

1888
01:56:49,146 --> 01:56:50,940
giving you that
"Iet's screw around"  look...

1889
01:56:50,981 --> 01:56:55,277
just remember,
she may be working for me.

1890
01:56:56,654 --> 01:56:57,780
All right. Fine.

1891
01:56:57,822 --> 01:56:59,073
But you?

1892
01:56:59,115 --> 01:57:01,784
No more conning.
No more.

1893
01:57:01,826 --> 01:57:03,244
If you're gonna be my wife...

1894
01:57:03,285 --> 01:57:04,912
you've got to live
a respectable life...

1895
01:57:04,954 --> 01:57:06,539
chopping cars.

1896
01:57:08,249 --> 01:57:10,334
First you got to help me
with one thing.

1897
01:57:10,376 --> 01:57:12,253
Well, first you got
to help me with one thing.

1898
01:57:26,975 --> 01:57:29,812
You're not gonna fall asleep
on me again, are you?

1899
01:57:29,853 --> 01:57:31,814
I feel pretty good
about tonight.

1900
01:57:43,075 --> 01:57:44,785
Look. I don't
want to go in there.

1901
01:57:44,826 --> 01:57:46,119
The bank owns it now.

1902
01:57:46,119 --> 01:57:47,621
There's still some stuff
they said you left.

1903
01:57:47,663 --> 01:57:49,248
I cleared out everything.

1904
01:57:58,298 --> 01:58:00,300
Surprise!

1905
01:58:34,834 --> 01:58:38,797
-How?
-My name is Page.

1906
01:58:55,313 --> 01:58:57,607
I never realized
I could feel this way again...

1907
01:58:57,649 --> 01:59:00,485
that I could be so totally
in love with someone.

1908
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,656
I feel the same way, Stanley.

1909
01:59:09,327 --> 01:59:12,163
-You're beautiful.
-Thank you.
