1
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:23,665
So stay with us
because later this afternoon,

2
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:26,552
we're lucky enough
to be talking to Anna Scott,

3
00:00:26,634 --> 00:00:28,465
Hollywood's biggest star by far.

4
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,749
Miss Scott's latest film
is once again topping the charts.

5
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,670
Of course l've seen her films...

6
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:24,029
and always thought
she was, well, fabulous.

7
00:02:24,114 --> 00:02:26,912
But, you know, a million, million miles
from the world l live in...

8
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:31,465
which is here, Notting Hill,
my favourite bit of London.

9
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:35,467
There's the market on weekdays selling
every fruit and vegetable known to man.

10
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:38,546
Rock-hard bananas,
five for a pound !

11
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:41,273
The tattoo parlour
with a guy outside who got drunk...

12
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:44,664
and now can't remember
why he chose ""l love Ken.""

13
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:46,745
The radical hairdressers...

14
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,950
where everyone comes out
looking like the Cookie Monster,

15
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:51,184
whether they want to or not.

16
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:53,265
And then, suddenly,
it's the weekend,

17
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:55,914
and from break of day hundreds
of stalls appear out of nowhere,

18
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:58,554
filling Portobello Road,
right up to Notting Hill Gate.

19
00:02:58,634 --> 00:03:02,024
And wherever you look thousands of
people are buying millions of antiques,

20
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:07,029
some genuine and some...
not quite so genuine.

21
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:10,663
And what's great is that lots of friends
have ended up in this part of London.

22
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:14,110
That's Tony, for example,
architect turned chef,

23
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,470
who recently invested all the money
he ever earned in a new restaurant.

24
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:20,591
And so, this is where
l spend my days and years...

25
00:03:20,674 --> 00:03:24,303
in this small village in the middle of
the city in a house with a blue door...

26
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:27,625
that my wife and l bought together
before she left me for a man...

27
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:30,274
who looked exactly like Harrison Ford.

28
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:33,187
And where l lead a strange half-life
with a lodger called--

29
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:35,105
Spike !

30
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:42,986
You couldn't help me with an incredibly
important decision, could you ?

31
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:46,908
lmportant compared to, let's say,
whether they cancel Third World debt ?

32
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,986
That's right. l am at last going out
on a date with the great Janine,

33
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:52,269
and l just wanna be sure
l've picked the right T-shirt.

34
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:55,152
- What are the choices ?
- Well, wait for it.

35
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:05,311
First there's this one.
Cool, huh ?

36
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:09,672
Yeah, it might make it hard
to strike a really romantic note.

37
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:11,585
Point taken.
Don't despair.

38
00:04:11,674 --> 00:04:15,223
lf it's romance we're looking for,
l believe l have just the thing.

39
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:23,028
Yeah, well, there again, she might not
think you had true love on your mind.

40
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:26,026
Right.
Just one more.

41
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,823
True love here l come.

42
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:42,872
Well, yeah. Yeah, that's--
that's, um, perfect.

43
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:45,832
Great. Thanks.

44
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:49,065
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

45
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:56,702
And so it was
just another hopeless Wednesday,

46
00:04:56,794 --> 00:04:59,433
as l walked the thousand yards
through the market to work,

47
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:03,826
never suspecting that this was the day
that was gonna change my life forever.

48
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:07,224
This is work, by the way,
my little travel bookshop,

49
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:11,226
- Morning, Martin.
- Morning, Monsignor.

50
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:14,192
which, um, well, sells travel books,

51
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:17,505
and, to be frank with you,
doesn't always sell many of those.

52
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:24,424
Classic.
Profit from major sales push,

53
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:27,506
minus Â£347.

54
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:32,464
Shall l, uh,
go and get you a cappuccino ?

55
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:35,432
- You know, ease the pain a bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

56
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:38,472
Better make it a half.
All l can afford.

57
00:05:38,554 --> 00:05:43,184
Get your logic.
Demi-cappu coming right up.

58
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:08,669
Um, can l help you at all ?

59
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:13,185
No, thanks.
l'll just... look around.

60
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:16,953
Fine.

61
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:25,226
Uh, that book's really not great.

62
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:29,193
Just in case, you know, browsing turned
to buying. You'd be wasting your money.

63
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:31,629
But if it's Turkey
you're interested in,

64
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:34,626
um, this one, on the other hand,
is very good.

65
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:38,753
Um, l think the man who wrote it has
actually been to Turkey, which helps.

66
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:42,543
Um, there's also
a very amusing incident with a kebab,

67
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:45,273
um, which is one
of many amusing incidents.

68
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:47,231
Thanks.
l'll think about it.

69
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:49,703
Or, in the bigger hardback variety,
there's--

70
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:53,707
l'm sorry.
Can you just give me a second ?

71
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:58,830
Excuse me.

72
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:00,870
- Yes ?
- Bad news.

73
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,307
What ?

74
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:05,824
We've got a security camera
in this bit of the shop.

75
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:07,108
So ?

76
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,788
So l saw you put that book
down your trousers.

77
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:15,153
- What book ?
- The one down your trousers.

78
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,702
l don't have a book
down my trousers.

79
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:19,671
Right.

80
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,949
l tell you what.
Um, l'll call the police, and, um,

81
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:25,663
if l'm wrong about the whole
""book down the trousers"" scenario,

82
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:27,107
l really apologize.

83
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:32,348
Okay. What if... l did
have a book down my trousers ?

84
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:35,153
Well, ideally,
when l went back to the desk,

85
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:40,103
you'd remove the Cadogan Guide
to Bali from your trousers...

86
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,266
and either wipe it
and put it back or buy it.

87
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:45,629
l'll see you in a sec.

88
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:48,069
l'm sorry about that.

89
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:50,543
No, it's fine.

90
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:54,343
l was gonna steal one,
but now l've changed my mind.

91
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,232
Oh, signed by the author,
l see.

92
00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:59,544
Um, yeah, couldn't stop him.

93
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:02,387
lf you can find an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.

94
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,343
Excuse me.

95
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:07,345
- Yes ?
- Can l have your autograph ?

96
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:09,789
Uh, sure.

97
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:15,350
- What's your name ?
- Rufus.

98
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,785
What does it say ?

99
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:26,709
That's my signature. And above it, it
says, ""Dear Rufus, you belong in jail.""

100
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,785
Good one.

101
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:33,864
- Do you want my phone number ?
- Tempting.

102
00:08:33,954 --> 00:08:36,673
But... no.
Thank you.

103
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,147
l will take this one.

104
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,589
Oh, right, right.
So, uh--

105
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:49,553
Well, on second thoughts,
um, maybe it's not that bad after all.

106
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,387
Actually, it's a sort
of a classic, really.

107
00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:55,910
None of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days.

108
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,825
And, um, l tell you what.

109
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,791
l'll throw in
one of those for free.

110
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,308
Useful for, uh, lighting fires,

111
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:05,192
wrapping fish,
that sort of thing.

112
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:10,383
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.

113
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:44,426
Cappuccino, as ordered.

114
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:46,470
Thanks.

115
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:49,512
l don't think you'll believe
who was just in here.

116
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:52,313
Who ?
Was it someone famous ?

117
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,745
Would be exciting, though,
wouldn't it,

118
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:00,064
if someone famous
came into the shop ? Hmm ?

119
00:10:00,154 --> 00:10:03,942
Do you know--
and this is pretty amazing, actually--

120
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:06,184
but l once saw Ringo Starr.

121
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:08,469
- Where was that ?
- Kensington High Street.

122
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:10,385
At least l think it was Ringo.

123
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:13,068
lt might have been that man
from Fiddler on the Roof.

124
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,714
- You know, Toppy.
- Topol.

125
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,354
Yes, that's right.
Topol.

126
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:20,265
Mm-hmm.

127
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:24,063
Actually, Ringo Starr doesn't--
doesn't look at all like, uh, Topol.

128
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:27,112
Yeah, but he was--
he was quite a long way away from me.

129
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:30,152
So actually it could've
been neither of them.

130
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:32,953
Yes, l suppose so, yes.

131
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:37,266
- lt's not a classic anecdote, is it ?
- Not a classic, no. No.

132
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:45,146
- Another one ?
- Yes. No.

133
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:48,544
Let's go crazy.
l'll have an orange juice.

134
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:08,072
- Oh, my God !
- Bugger ! l'm so sorry. l'm so sorry.

135
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,873
- Here. Let me--
- Get your hands off !

136
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:13,627
l'm really sorry.
l-- l live just over the street.

137
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,786
l have, um, water and soap.
You can get cleaned up.

138
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:18,990
No, thank you.
l just need to get my car back.

139
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:22,271
l also have a phone.
l'm confident that in five minutes...

140
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:25,187
we could have you spick-and-span
and back on the street again.

141
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:27,868
ln the non-prostitute sense,
obviously.

142
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:33,911
All right. Well-- What do you mean,
""just over the street"" ?

143
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:37,589
- Give it to me in yards.
- Uh, 18 yards.

144
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:40,791
That's my house there
with the blue front door.

145
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:46,711
Come on in.
l'll just-- l'll just--

146
00:11:49,674 --> 00:11:54,543
Um, right. Right.
Come in.

147
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:57,865
lt's, um, not quite as tidy
as it normally is, l fear.

148
00:11:57,954 --> 00:12:00,991
But, um--
The bathroom's on the top floor.

149
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:04,783
And the telephone's just--
just up here.

150
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,504
Here.
Let-- Let me, um--

151
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:17,384
Um, round the corner.
Straight on-- straight on up.

152
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:22,865
Bugger.

153
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:46,671
Would you like a cup of tea
before you go ?

154
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:49,029
- No.
- Coffee ?

155
00:12:49,114 --> 00:12:51,753
- No.
- Orange juice ?

156
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:57,112
Probably not.
Um, something else cold.

157
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:03,069
Coke ? Water ?

158
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:04,985
Some disgusting sugary drink...

159
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:07,065
pretending to have something to do
with fruits of the forest ?

160
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:10,066
- No.
- Would you like something to eat ?

161
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,304
Uh, something to nibble ?

162
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:16,069
Um, apricots soaked in honey ?

163
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:19,430
Quite why, no one knows, because
it stops them tasting of apricots...

164
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:21,744
and makes them taste like honey,

165
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:26,589
and if you wanted honey, you'd just
buy honey instead of... apricots.

166
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:29,029
Um, but nevertheless,
there we go there.

167
00:13:29,114 --> 00:13:31,150
They're yours if you want them.

168
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,749
Do you always say ""no""
to everything ?

169
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:45,468
l'd better be going.

170
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:48,671
Thanks for your, uh, help.

171
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,585
You're welcome.

172
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:55,794
And, uh, may l also say,
um, heavenly.

173
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:58,672
l'll just take
my one chance to say it.

174
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,904
After you've read
that terrible book,

175
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:03,224
you're certainly not going
to be coming back to the shop.

176
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:05,828
Thank you.

177
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:09,702
Yeah.
Well, my pleasure.

178
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:22,473
So...

179
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:24,510
it was nice to meet you.

180
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:28,667
Surreal but, um-- but nice.

181
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:32,505
Sorry.

182
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:43,024
""Surreal but nice"" ?
What was l thinking ?

183
00:14:56,754 --> 00:15:00,633
- l forgot my other bag.
- Oh, right. Right.

184
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:10,945
Thanks.

185
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:44,825
l'm very sorry about
the ""surreal but nice"" comment.

186
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:47,269
- Disaster.
- That's okay.

187
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:51,905
l thought the apricot and honey thing
was the real low point.

188
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,588
Oh, my God.
My flatmate.

189
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:59,234
l'm sorry.
There's no excuse for him.

190
00:16:03,634 --> 00:16:05,864
l'm just going into the kitchen
to get some food.

191
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:10,152
Then l'm gonna tell you a story
that will make your balls shrink
to the size of raisins.

192
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:18,310
Probably best
not to tell anyone about this.

193
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,227
Right. Right.
No one.

194
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,509
l mean, l'll tell myself sometimes.

195
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:26,108
But don't worry.
l won't believe it.

196
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,346
There's something wrong
with this yogurt.

197
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:53,146
lt's not yogurt.
lt's mayonnaise.

198
00:16:53,234 --> 00:16:55,145
Oh, right.
There we are then.

199
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,832
On for a videofest tonight ?

200
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:04,191
l got some absolute classics.

201
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:09,586
- Smile.
- No.

202
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:16,867
- Smile.
- l've got nothing to smile about.

203
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:27,385
Okay.

204
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:29,988
ln about seven seconds,

205
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:32,634
l'm going to ask you
to marry me.

206
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,502
lmagine.

207
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:46,224
Somewhere in the world
there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.

208
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:51,268
Yes, she is, uh,

209
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:55,029
fairly fabulous.

210
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:05,228
- Do you have any books by Dickens ?
- No.

211
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:09,592
No, l'm afraid we're a travel bookshop.
We only sell travel books.

212
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:14,311
Oh, right. How about
the new John Grisham thriller ?

213
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:19,508
Well, no, 'cause that's, uh--
that's a novel too, isn't it ?

214
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:22,313
Oh, right.

215
00:18:23,434 --> 00:18:28,462
Have you got Winnie the Pooh ?

216
00:18:29,994 --> 00:18:32,349
Martin, your customer.

217
00:18:32,434 --> 00:18:34,390
Uh, can l help you ?

218
00:18:51,754 --> 00:18:55,190
Just, um, incidentally,

219
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:58,152
uh, why...
are you wearing that ?

220
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:01,783
Combination of factors really.
Uh, no clean clothes.

221
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,583
There never will be, you know,
unless you actually clean your clothes.

222
00:19:05,674 --> 00:19:07,983
Right.
Vicious circle.

223
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:10,634
And l was, like,
rooting around in your things...

224
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,670
and l found this,
and l thought ""cool.""

225
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,788
Kinda... spacey.

226
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:22,547
There's something wrong
with the goggles, though.

227
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:25,387
No, they were, um, prescription.

228
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:28,944
-Groovy.
-So l could see all the fishes properly.

229
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,548
You should do more
of this stuff.

230
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:35,422
- So, look, any messages today ?
- Yeah, l wrote a couple down.

231
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:38,745
So there were two.
There were two messages ? Right ?

232
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:43,785
You want me to write down
all your messages ?

233
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:47,833
Okay, who are the ones
that you didn't write down from ?

234
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:51,027
No. Gone completely.

235
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:52,945
Oh, no.
There was one from your mum.

236
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:55,548
She said don't forget lunch,
and her leg's hurting again.

237
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:58,068
- No one else ?
- Absolutely no one else.

238
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:04,545
Though if we're going for this obsessive
writing down all the message thing,

239
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:07,910
some American girl called Anna
called a few days ago.

240
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:16,032
- What did she say ?
- Well, it was genuinely bizarre.

241
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:21,347
She said, ""Hi. lt's Anna.""
Then she said, ""Call me at The Ritz""...

242
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:24,744
and then gave herself
a completely different name.

243
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:28,588
- Which was ?
- Absolutely no idea.

244
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,983
Remembering one name's hard enough.

245
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:33,224
No, l-- l know that.
She-- She said that.

246
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:35,464
Um, l know she's using another name.

247
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:38,864
The problem is
she left the message with my flatmate...

248
00:20:38,954 --> 00:20:40,785
which was a very serious mistake.

249
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:44,992
Um, l don't know. lmagine, if you will,
the stupidest person you've ever met.

250
00:20:45,074 --> 00:20:49,113
- Are you doing that ?
- Yes, sir, l have him in my mind.

251
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:52,345
And now double it.
And that is the, um-- what can l say--

252
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,868
the git that l am living with.

253
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,273
And he can't remember--

254
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:59,312
- Try Flintstone.
- l'm sorry, what ?

255
00:20:59,394 --> 00:21:02,704
l think she said
her name was Flintstone.

256
00:21:04,674 --> 00:21:09,429
l don't-- l don't suppose, um,
Flintstone rings any bells, does it ?

257
00:21:09,514 --> 00:21:12,631
- Oh, l'll put you right through, sir.
- Oh, my God.

258
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:18,186
Hello. Hi.

259
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:20,105
- Hi there.
- Hello ?

260
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,709
- Sorry. lt's William... Thacker.
- Yes ?

261
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:28,228
Um, we-- l work in a bookshop.

262
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:35,146
Oh, no, l promise you l've never played
anything cool in my entire life.

263
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:38,590
My flatmate, who'll l'll stab to death
later, never gave me the message.

264
00:21:40,114 --> 00:21:42,628
l don't know.
Perhaps, um,

265
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:46,866
l could drop round
for tea later or something.

266
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:51,742
Right. Right. Great.

267
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:01,751
Classic.

268
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:08,311
Classic.

269
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:47,234
- Which floor ?
- Three, please.

270
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:17,108
Uh, are you sure this is--

271
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:19,788
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

272
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:32,425
- Hi. Hi. l'm Karen.
- Hi.

273
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:34,948
l'm sorry.
Things are running a little bit late.

274
00:23:35,034 --> 00:23:38,947
Here's the, uh, thing.
Do you wanna come this way ?

275
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,628
Through here.

276
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:47,863
So what did you
think of the film ?

277
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:50,627
Yeah, l thought it was fantastic.
l thought it was, uh,

278
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:54,104
Close Encounters
meets Jean de Florette.

279
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,945
l agree.

280
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:00,832
l'm sorry. l didn't get down
what magazines you're from.

281
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:03,269
- Time Out.
- Great.

282
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:06,232
And you're from ?

283
00:24:11,154 --> 00:24:12,951
Horse & Hound.

284
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:20,630
The name's William Thacker. l think,
actually, she might be expecting me.

285
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:23,387
Oh, okay.
Take a seat and l'll go check.

286
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:30,065
l see you've, uh--
l see you've brought her some flowers.

287
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:36,231
These are for my,
um, grandmother.

288
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:38,953
She's in a hospital
just down the road.

289
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:41,628
Thought l'd kill two birds
with one stone, you know.

290
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:44,831
Sure, right.
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:47,508
Which hospital's that ?

292
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:51,030
Do you mind me not saying ?
lt's a rather distressing disease.

293
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,105
Name of the hospital
kind of gives it away.

294
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:59,227
Right, uh, Mr Thacker.
Will you come this way.

295
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:01,589
Right.

296
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:04,427
You've got five minutes.

297
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:15,906
- Hi.
- Hello.

298
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:19,748
Uh, l brought these, but clearly--

299
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:23,463
No, they're great.
They're great.

300
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:26,307
Ah, listen,
l'm sorry about not ringing back.

301
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,225
The whole ""two-names concept""...

302
00:25:28,314 --> 00:25:30,703
was totally too much for my flatmate's
pea-sized intellect.

303
00:25:30,794 --> 00:25:34,469
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.
l always pick a... cartoon character.

304
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:36,624
Last time l was Mrs Bambi.

305
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:42,506
- Everything all right ?
- Yes, thank you.

306
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:45,267
And you're from, uh,
Horse & Hound.

307
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:50,553
ls that so ? Well.

308
00:25:56,274 --> 00:25:58,310
So, uh--

309
00:26:01,274 --> 00:26:06,302
Uh, l'll just... fire away then,
shall l ?

310
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,790
Right.

311
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:16,265
The film's great, and, um,

312
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:19,232
l just was wondering whether...

313
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:21,350
you ever thought of having, um,

314
00:26:21,434 --> 00:26:25,029
more, uh, horses in it.

315
00:26:28,034 --> 00:26:31,424
Uh, well, we would have liked to,

316
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:36,634
but it was, um, difficult,
obviously, being set in space.

317
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:41,749
Space, right, yeah.
Yeah, obviously very difficult.

318
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:44,905
l'm so sorry.
l arrived outside.

319
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:46,871
They thrust this thing
into my hand--

320
00:26:46,954 --> 00:26:50,105
No, it's my fault.
l thought this would all be over by now.

321
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:52,788
l just wanted to sort of apologize
for the kissing thing.

322
00:26:52,874 --> 00:26:54,705
l seriously don't know
what came over me.

323
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:57,672
And l just wanted to make sure
that you were fine about it.

324
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:03,825
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely fine.

325
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:08,713
Do remember that Miss Scott is also
keen to talk about her next project...

326
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,343
which is, um, shooting
later in the summer.

327
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:15,744
Ah, yes, excellent.
Excellent.

328
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:24,473
Any horses in that one ?

329
00:27:24,554 --> 00:27:29,753
Or hounds for that matter. Our readers
are equally intrigued by both species.

330
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:32,507
lt takes place on a submarine.

331
00:27:32,594 --> 00:27:35,904
Oh. Well, bad luck.

332
00:27:37,274 --> 00:27:39,742
But, um,

333
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:42,029
if there were horses in it,

334
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:44,582
would you be riding them...

335
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:49,111
or would you be getting, a--
a stunt-horse-double-man-thing ?

336
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:56,064
l-l'm a complete moron.
l apologize. l--

337
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:59,863
This is very weird. lt's the sort
of thing that happens in dreams,

338
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:02,422
not in real life.

339
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,869
l mean, good dreams.
lt's a--

340
00:28:04,954 --> 00:28:08,390
lt's a dream, in fact,
uh, to see you again.

341
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:13,429
What happens next in the dream ?

342
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:19,392
l suppose in the, uh, dream--

343
00:28:19,474 --> 00:28:22,864
dream scenario--
l just, uh,

344
00:28:22,954 --> 00:28:25,024
change my personality...

345
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:27,674
because you can do that
in dreams and, um,

346
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:33,987
walk over and, uh, kiss the girl.

347
00:28:34,074 --> 00:28:36,634
But, uh--

348
00:28:43,994 --> 00:28:47,543
Time's up, l'm afraid.
Did you get what you wanted ?

349
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:52,628
- Um, nearly, nearly.
- Well, maybe just one last question.

350
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:56,508
- Sure.
- Right, right.

351
00:28:59,994 --> 00:29:03,270
Are you... busy tonight ?

352
00:29:03,354 --> 00:29:08,030
- Yes.
- Right. Right.

353
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:13,342
- Come in.
- Well, it was nice to meet you.

354
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:15,584
Yes, and you.

355
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:17,983
Surreal... but nice.

356
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:22,272
Thank you. You are Horse & Hound's
favourite actress.

357
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:25,949
You and Black Beauty...

358
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:27,865
tied.

359
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:34,625
How was she ?

360
00:29:34,714 --> 00:29:38,024
Oh, um, fabulous.

361
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:42,027
Excellent. Wait a minute.
She took your grandmother's flowers.

362
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:45,504
Uh, yeah, yeah.
That's right.

363
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:47,585
- Bitch.
- Oh, Mr Thacker.

364
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:51,906
Mr Thacker, if you'd like to come with
me, we can rush you through the others.

365
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:53,347
The others ?

366
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:55,902
Mr Thacker is from Horse & Hound.

367
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:01,063
- How's it going ?
- Very well, thank you.

368
00:30:01,154 --> 00:30:02,507
Have a seat.

369
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:07,591
Well, did you enjoy the film ?

370
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:10,632
Yes, enormously.

371
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:12,466
- Well, fire away.
- Right.

372
00:30:13,954 --> 00:30:16,184
Did you enjoy making the film ?

373
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:19,983
- Yes, l did.
- Good.

374
00:30:20,074 --> 00:30:22,429
Any bit in particular ?

375
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:25,506
You tell me what bit
you enjoyed the most,

376
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:28,472
and l'll tell you
if l enjoyed making that bit.

377
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:33,989
Uh, l...

378
00:30:34,074 --> 00:30:36,952
liked the bit in space...

379
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:38,865
very much.

380
00:30:38,954 --> 00:30:42,390
Did you identify with the character
you're playing ?

381
00:30:51,714 --> 00:30:55,343
Oh. Why not ?

382
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:05,029
Because he's playing
a psychopathic flesh-eating robot.

383
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,230
Classic.

384
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:09,987
So, uh,

385
00:31:10,074 --> 00:31:12,542
is this your first film ?

386
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:15,353
No. lt's my 22nd.

387
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:19,188
Of course it is.
Any favourites among the 22 ?

388
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:22,425
Working with Leonardo.

389
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:26,393
- Da Vinci ?
- DiCaprio.

390
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:29,193
Of course.

391
00:31:29,274 --> 00:31:33,108
And is-- is he your favourite
ltalian director ?

392
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:40,466
- Mr Thacker.
- Oh, no.

393
00:31:40,554 --> 00:31:43,227
- Have you got a minute ?
- No.

394
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:57,983
Um-- Yeah, so the, um--

395
00:31:58,074 --> 00:32:02,147
the-- the thing l was doing tonight,
l'm not doing any more.

396
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:04,589
l told them l had
to spend the evening...

397
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:08,303
with Britain's premier
equestrian journalist.

398
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:11,352
Oh. Well, great.

399
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:13,504
Fantastic.
That's, uh--

400
00:32:13,594 --> 00:32:16,711
Oh. Shittity brickitty.

401
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:20,184
lt's my sister's birthday. Shit.
We're meant to be having dinner.

402
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:23,027
- Okay, that's fine.
- No. l'm sure l can get out of it.

403
00:32:23,114 --> 00:32:26,424
No, l mean, if it's fine with you,
l'll be your date.

404
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:30,912
You--
You'll be my date...

405
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:33,588
to my little sister's
birthday party ?

406
00:32:33,674 --> 00:32:37,269
- lf it's all right.
- Well, yeah, l'm sure it's all right.

407
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:39,106
My friend Max is cooking,

408
00:32:39,194 --> 00:32:42,072
and he is generally acknowledged
to be the worst cook in the world.

409
00:32:42,154 --> 00:32:46,386
But, um, you know, you could hide
the food in your handbag or something.

410
00:32:46,474 --> 00:32:50,547
- Okay.
- Okay.

411
00:32:52,474 --> 00:32:56,183
- He's bringing a girl ?
- Miracles do happen.

412
00:32:56,274 --> 00:33:00,187
- Does the girl have a name ?
- Don't know. Wouldn't say.

413
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:02,868
Oh, Christ !
What is going on in there ?

414
00:33:02,954 --> 00:33:06,583
Oh, God !

415
00:33:08,714 --> 00:33:11,387
Hi. Come on in.
Vague food crisis.

416
00:33:17,074 --> 00:33:18,985
Hiya ! Sorry.

417
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:21,872
The guinea fowl is proving
more complicated than expected.

418
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:24,752
- He's cooking guinea-fowl ?
- Don't even ask.

419
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,142
Good Lord,
you're the spitting image of--

420
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:32,145
Bella, this is Anna.

421
00:33:33,834 --> 00:33:35,870
- Right.
- Okay, crisis over.

422
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:38,752
Max, this is Anna.

423
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:42,110
- Hi.
- Hello, Anna--

424
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,833
Scott.
Have some wine.

425
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:47,064
Thank you.

426
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:48,826
l'll get it.

427
00:33:51,714 --> 00:33:53,545
Red or white ?

428
00:33:53,634 --> 00:33:56,273
- Oh. Hey.
- Hi.

429
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:59,744
- Oh, yes, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

430
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:01,950
Look, your brother's
brought this girl.

431
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,387
Hi, guys.

432
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:06,585
Oh, holy fuck !

433
00:34:06,674 --> 00:34:09,984
Hon, this is Anna. Anna, this is Honey.
She's my baby sister.

434
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:11,985
Oh. Hi.

435
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:14,827
Oh, God. This is one
of those key moments in life...

436
00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:17,712
when it's possible
you can be really genuinely cool...

437
00:34:17,794 --> 00:34:22,743
and l-- l'm going to fail
just a hundred percent.

438
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:28,946
l-- l absolutely,
totally and utterly adore you.

439
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:33,152
And l just think... you are
the most beautiful woman in the world.

440
00:34:33,234 --> 00:34:36,271
And, more importantly,
l genuinely believe,

441
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:41,064
and l've believed for some time now,
that we could be best friends.

442
00:34:41,154 --> 00:34:43,987
So what do you think ?

443
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:47,831
Uh, lucky me.

444
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:52,308
Well, happy birthday.

445
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:57,229
Oh, you gave me a present.
We're best friends already then.

446
00:34:57,314 --> 00:34:59,908
Marry Will. He's a really nice guy.
Then we can be sisters.

447
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:02,224
Well, l'll think about it.

448
00:35:04,034 --> 00:35:06,468
That'll be Bernie.

449
00:35:07,634 --> 00:35:09,829
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry l'm late.

450
00:35:09,914 --> 00:35:12,712
Bollocksed up at work again, l fear.

451
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:15,228
- Millions down the drain.
- Well done.

452
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,306
- Bernie, this is Anna.
- Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.

453
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:22,103
-And you.
-Honey bunny, Happy birthday to you

454
00:35:22,194 --> 00:35:24,867
- Hi, Bella.
- Hi.

455
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:28,424
Um, it-- it-- it's a hat.
You don't have to wear it or anything.

456
00:35:28,514 --> 00:35:31,312
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

457
00:35:34,154 --> 00:35:36,668
- Hi.
- What ?

458
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:38,631
- Wine, Bernie ?
- Mm.

459
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:41,023
You haven't slept with her, have you ?

460
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:43,423
That is a cheap question, and
the answer is, or course, no comment.

461
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:45,345
- No comment means ""yes.""
- No, it doesn't.

462
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,265
- Do you ever masturbate ?
- Definitely no comment.

463
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,868
- You see, it means ""yes.""
- Oh, my God !

464
00:35:49,954 --> 00:35:54,311
So, uh, tell me,
um, Anna, what do you do ?

465
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:57,989
- l'm an actress.
- Oh, splendid.

466
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,985
What do you do ?

467
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,669
l'm actually in the stock market myself,
so, uh, not really similar fields.

468
00:36:03,754 --> 00:36:06,746
Though, um-- um, l have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff.

469
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:11,112
Um-- uh, P. G. Wodehouse.
Farce, all that, you know.

470
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:13,708
""Careful there, Vicar.""

471
00:36:13,794 --> 00:36:16,911
Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,
though, acting.

472
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:20,828
- The wages are a scandal, aren't they ?
- They can be.

473
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:22,791
l see friends from university--
clever chaps.

474
00:36:22,874 --> 00:36:24,705
Been in the business longer than you.

475
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:29,345
They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.

476
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,629
You know, it's no life.

477
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:35,912
- What sort of acting do you do ?
- Films, mainly.

478
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:40,670
Oh, splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies ?

479
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:45,430
l mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid ?

480
00:36:45,514 --> 00:36:47,664
Fifteen million dollars.

481
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,505
Right.

482
00:36:50,594 --> 00:36:54,633
So that's, well, fairly good.

483
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:56,670
Right, l think we're ready.

484
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,505
Bella, can you tell me
where l can find--

485
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,550
Oh, sorry.
lt's down the corridor on the right.

486
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:04,625
l'll show you.

487
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,823
Quickly, quickly.
Talk very, very quickly.

488
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:11,427
What are you doing here
with Anna Scott ?

489
00:37:11,514 --> 00:37:13,425
- Anna Scott ?
- Yes. Shut up !

490
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:15,425
- What, the film star ?
- Shh !

491
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:17,982
- Oh, God !
- What ?

492
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:20,793
- Oh, God. Oh, goddy God.
- What did you say to her ?

493
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:24,184
l don't believe it.
l actually walked into the loo with her.

494
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:26,993
l was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning her jeans.

495
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:29,383
- She had to ask me to leave.
- Oh, God.

496
00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:31,385
So you knew who she was ?

497
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:33,584
Of course l did, but he didn't.

498
00:37:33,674 --> 00:37:37,587
Well, not instantly, but l-- l--
l got away with it.

499
00:37:40,514 --> 00:37:45,065
- What do you think of the guinea-fowl ?
- l'm a vegetarian.

500
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:47,463
Oh, God.

501
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:50,227
So, how's the guinea-fowl ?

502
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:53,545
Best guinea-fowl
l've ever tasted.

503
00:38:25,914 --> 00:38:29,793
Having you here, Anna, firmly
establishes what l've long suspected--

504
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,547
that we really are the most
desperate lot of underachievers.

505
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:35,432
- Shame.
- l'm not saying it's a bad thing.

506
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,745
ln fact, l think it's something
we should take pride in.

507
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:41,951
l'm gonna give the last brownie
as a prize...

508
00:38:42,034 --> 00:38:44,309
to the saddest act here.

509
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:46,988
- Uh-oh.
- Bern.

510
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,146
Yeah, all right.
Well, obviously, it's me, isn't it ?

511
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:53,192
l mean, l work in the city in a job
l don't understand,

512
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:55,583
and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me.

513
00:38:55,674 --> 00:38:58,108
l haven't had a girlfriend since--
well, since puberty.

514
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:01,106
And... nobody fancies me.

515
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:03,628
And if these cheeks get any chubbier,
they never will.

516
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:07,343
- Nonsense. l fancy you.
- Really ?

517
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:09,902
Yeah. Or l did
before you got so fat.

518
00:39:09,994 --> 00:39:12,792
You see.
And unless l'm much mistaken,

519
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:15,388
your job still pays you
rather a lot of money...

520
00:39:15,474 --> 00:39:17,783
whilst Honey here
earns 20 pence a week...

521
00:39:17,874 --> 00:39:20,547
flogging her guts out
in London's worst record store.

522
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:23,626
Yes ! And l haven't got hair.
l've got feathers.

523
00:39:23,714 --> 00:39:27,389
And l've got funny goggly eyes.
And l'm attracted to cruel men.

524
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:29,908
And, actually,
no one will marry me...

525
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:32,986
because, um, my boosies
have actually started shrinking.

526
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:35,383
- You see, it's incredibly sad.
- But on the other hand,

527
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,146
her best friend is Anna Scott.

528
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:40,544
That's true. l can't deny it.
She needs me. What can l say ?

529
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:45,110
And most of her limbs work, whereas
l'm stuck in this thing day and night,

530
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:47,105
in a house full of ramps.

531
00:39:47,194 --> 00:39:49,947
And to add insult
to serious injury,

532
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:55,062
l've totally given up smoking,
my favourite thing.

533
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:59,306
And, um, well, the truth is,

534
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:01,510
we can't have a baby.

535
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,945
Oh, Belle.

536
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:12,344
C'est la vie.

537
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:17,663
Still, um, we're lucky in lots of ways.

538
00:40:17,754 --> 00:40:20,632
But surely that's worth a brownie.

539
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:27,182
Well, l don't know.
Look at William.

540
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:30,311
- Very unsuccessful professionally.
- That's true.

541
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:35,024
Divorced. Used to be handsome,
now kind of squidgy round the edges.

542
00:40:36,194 --> 00:40:38,867
And absolutely certain never
to hear from Anna again...

543
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:41,866
- once she's heard that his
nickname at school was--
- Floppy.

544
00:40:41,954 --> 00:40:44,991
You did.
l can't believe it, you did.

545
00:40:45,074 --> 00:40:48,305
Thanks very much. Thank you.
Well, at least l get the last brownie.

546
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:50,225
l think so, yes.

547
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,191
Well, wait.
What about me ?

548
00:40:53,714 --> 00:40:57,593
l'm sorry ?
You think you deserve the brownie ?

549
00:40:57,674 --> 00:41:01,713
Well, a shot at it at least, huh ?

550
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:04,592
You'll have to prove it.
This is a very, very good brownie.

551
00:41:04,674 --> 00:41:07,234
l'm gonna fight for it.

552
00:41:07,314 --> 00:41:10,511
l've been on a diet
every day since l was 19,

553
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:13,791
which basically means
l've been hungry for a decade.

554
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:19,390
l've had a series of not-nice
boyfriends, one of whom hit me.

555
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:22,386
Uh, and every time
l get my heart broken,

556
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:26,626
the newspapers splash it about
as though it's entertainment.

557
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:33,503
And... it's taken two rather painful,
um, operations...

558
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:35,471
to get me looking like this.

559
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:38,546
- Really ?
- Really.

560
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:45,185
And one day not long from now,
my looks will go,

561
00:41:45,274 --> 00:41:47,993
they will discover l can't act,

562
00:41:48,074 --> 00:41:52,704
and l will become
some sad, middle-aged woman...

563
00:41:52,794 --> 00:41:57,424
who... looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.

564
00:42:05,034 --> 00:42:07,389
No, nice try, gorgeous,
but you don't fool anyone.

565
00:42:10,034 --> 00:42:11,911
Pathetic effort
to hog the brownie.

566
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:17,110
- Thank you for such a terrific time.
- l'm delighted.

567
00:42:18,514 --> 00:42:21,312
- That's a great tie.
- Now you're lying.

568
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:23,908
Okay, it's true.
l told you l was bad at acting.

569
00:42:23,994 --> 00:42:26,303
- lt was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, and you. And you.

570
00:42:26,394 --> 00:42:29,033
l'll wait until you've gone
before l tell him you're a vegetarian.

571
00:42:33,314 --> 00:42:36,670
- Good night.
- l'm so sorry about the loo thing.

572
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,143
l meant to leave.
l just--

573
00:42:39,234 --> 00:42:41,543
Ring me if you want someone
to go shopping with.

574
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:45,024
l know lots of nice, cheap places,
not that money is necessarily--

575
00:42:45,114 --> 00:42:46,945
lt was just so nice to meet you.

576
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:49,787
- Happy birthday. You're my style guru.
- Thank you.

577
00:42:49,874 --> 00:42:51,910
- Sorry. Can l just--
- Oh.

578
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:53,825
- Thanks.
- Leave her.

579
00:42:53,914 --> 00:42:55,745
- Good night, everyone.
- Bye.

580
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:58,632
Max, Belle,
we'll see you in a couple of days.

581
00:42:58,714 --> 00:43:01,103
- Thank you, everybody. Call us.
- Bye, guys.

582
00:43:01,194 --> 00:43:03,754
- Bye, Anna.
- Love your work.

583
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:06,143
Bye, Hon.

584
00:43:12,314 --> 00:43:16,068
Sorry. They always do that
when l leave the house.

585
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:19,669
lt's a stupid thing.
l hate it.

586
00:43:29,354 --> 00:43:31,914
- ""Floppy,"" huh ?
- lt's the hair.

587
00:43:31,994 --> 00:43:34,303
- Mm-hmm.
- lt's to do with the hair.

588
00:43:36,794 --> 00:43:38,989
Why is she in a wheelchair ?

589
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:43,306
Uh, because she had an accident
about 18 months ago.

590
00:43:43,394 --> 00:43:46,431
And the pregnancy thing,
is that to do with the accident ?

591
00:43:46,514 --> 00:43:47,867
You know, l'm not sure.

592
00:43:47,954 --> 00:43:51,105
l don't think they tried for kids
before, as fate would have it.

593
00:43:59,274 --> 00:44:02,152
Do you want to, um--

594
00:44:02,234 --> 00:44:05,226
My place is just, um--

595
00:44:05,314 --> 00:44:07,384
Too complicated.

596
00:44:07,474 --> 00:44:09,669
That's fine.

597
00:44:14,394 --> 00:44:16,464
Busy tomorrow ?

598
00:44:18,474 --> 00:44:21,750
- l thought you were leaving tomorrow.
- l was.

599
00:44:24,474 --> 00:44:26,465
All these streets round here have...

600
00:44:26,554 --> 00:44:28,909
these mysterious communal gardens
in the middle of them.

601
00:44:28,994 --> 00:44:31,269
- They're like little villages.
- Let's go in.

602
00:44:31,354 --> 00:44:33,822
Ah, no, that's the point.
They're private villages.

603
00:44:33,914 --> 00:44:36,712
Only the people who live round the edges
are allowed in.

604
00:44:36,794 --> 00:44:39,945
Oh. You abide by rules like that ?

605
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:42,264
l don't. No, no.
But others do.

606
00:44:42,354 --> 00:44:44,629
l just do what l want.

607
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:47,512
Um-- Right.

608
00:44:50,674 --> 00:44:53,393
Whoopsidaisies.

609
00:44:53,474 --> 00:44:55,908
What did you say ?

610
00:44:55,994 --> 00:44:58,508
- Nothing.
- Yes, you did.

611
00:44:58,594 --> 00:45:02,553
- No, l didn't.
- You said, ""Whoopsidaisies.""

612
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:05,785
No one says, ""Whoopsidaisies,"" do they ?
l mean, unless they're--

613
00:45:05,874 --> 00:45:09,071
There is no ""unless."" Because no one
has said ""Whoopsidaisies"" for 50 years.

614
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:12,863
And even then it was-- it was just
little girls with blonde ringlets.

615
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:16,947
Exactly. Right.
So here we go again.

616
00:45:18,794 --> 00:45:21,592
Oh ! Oh ! Whoopsidaisies.

617
00:45:23,114 --> 00:45:25,628
Yeah, well, it's a disease.
lt's a clinical thing.

618
00:45:25,714 --> 00:45:29,309
l'm taking pills and having injections.
And l'm told it won't last long.

619
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,227
- Okay, stand aside.
- l don't think that's a good idea.

620
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:35,192
Really, it's quite, um, tricky.
Anna.

621
00:45:36,794 --> 00:45:40,787
Anna, don't. lt's harder than it--
No, it's not. lt's easy.

622
00:45:48,554 --> 00:45:50,385
Come on, Flopsy.

623
00:45:50,474 --> 00:45:52,544
Right.

624
00:45:52,634 --> 00:45:55,023
All right.

625
00:45:55,114 --> 00:45:58,902
Oh, bugger.

626
00:45:58,994 --> 00:46:02,350
Oh, God,
this could be very unpleasant.

627
00:46:05,954 --> 00:46:09,583
Ay !
Bugger, bugger.

628
00:46:12,994 --> 00:46:18,068
Now what in the world in this garden
could make that ordeal worthwhile ?

629
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:33,388
Nice garden.

630
00:47:04,434 --> 00:47:07,267
""For June who loved this garden.

631
00:47:07,354 --> 00:47:10,505
From Joseph who always sat beside her.''

632
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:17,271
Some people do spend
their whole lives together.

633
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:52,145
Come and sit with me.

634
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,948
Bollocks ! Bollocks !

635
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:09,787
- Have you seen my glasses ?
- No, afraid not.

636
00:48:09,874 --> 00:48:13,867
Big, big bollocks !
Average day, my glasses are everywhere.

637
00:48:13,954 --> 00:48:16,263
Everywhere l look
there's a pair of glasses.

638
00:48:16,354 --> 00:48:18,948
But when l want to go to the cinema,
they've vanished.

639
00:48:19,034 --> 00:48:20,865
lt's one of life's real cruelties.

640
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:24,264
That's compared to, like,
earthquakes in the Far East
or testicular cancer, is it ?

641
00:48:24,354 --> 00:48:26,584
Oh, shit.
ls that the time ?

642
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:30,110
Thanks for all your help
on the glasses thing.

643
00:48:30,194 --> 00:48:32,424
Oh, you're welcome.
Did you find them ?

644
00:48:32,514 --> 00:48:34,391
- Sort of.
- Great.

645
00:49:03,354 --> 00:49:05,185
So who left who ?

646
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:08,027
- Uh, she left me.
- Why ?

647
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:11,265
- She saw through me.
- Uh-oh.

648
00:49:11,354 --> 00:49:14,505
That's not good.

649
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:16,710
You can give me
Anna Scott any day.

650
00:49:16,794 --> 00:49:19,592
l didn't like her last film. Fell asleep
as soon as the lights went down.

651
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:21,505
l don't really care
what the film's like.

652
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:24,188
Any film with her in,
it's fine by me.

653
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:28,224
She's not my type at all.
l prefer the other one.

654
00:49:28,314 --> 00:49:30,703
You know, blonde, sweet-looking.

655
00:49:30,794 --> 00:49:32,625
You know, what's-her-name.

656
00:49:32,714 --> 00:49:34,909
Has an orgasm every time
you take her out for a cup of coffee.

657
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:37,030
Meg Ryan.

658
00:49:37,114 --> 00:49:40,390
No, she's too wholesome.
The point about Miss Scott is...

659
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:43,272
she's got that twinkle in her eyes.

660
00:49:43,354 --> 00:49:45,914
Probably drug-induced.
Spends most of her life in bloody rehab.

661
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:48,462
Well, whatever.
She's so clearly up for it.

662
00:49:48,554 --> 00:49:51,352
You see, most girls, they're all like,
""Stay away, chum.""

663
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:55,347
But Anna,
she is absolutely gagging for it.

664
00:49:57,354 --> 00:49:59,709
Do you know that in over 50Â°%
of the languages,

665
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:03,423
the word for ""actress"" is
the same as the word for ""prostitute"" ?

666
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:06,028
Where did you get that from ?

667
00:50:06,114 --> 00:50:10,585
And Anna is your definitive actress,

668
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,303
someone really filthy
you can just flip over and start again.

669
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:18,951
- Right, that's it. Sorry.
- No, no. There's really no point.

670
00:50:21,794 --> 00:50:23,910
Um, sorry--
sorry to disturb you guys.

671
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:26,303
- But, um--
- Can l help ?

672
00:50:26,394 --> 00:50:29,784
Well, yeah. l wish l hadn't overheard
your conversation, but l did.

673
00:50:29,874 --> 00:50:32,342
And, um, l just think, you know,

674
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:35,232
the person you're talking about
is a real person.

675
00:50:35,314 --> 00:50:38,147
And l think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration...

676
00:50:38,234 --> 00:50:40,794
rather than having jerks like you
drooling over her.

677
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,434
Oh, sod off, mate.
What are you, her dad ?

678
00:50:50,834 --> 00:50:53,029
- l'm sorry.
- No, l love that you tried.

679
00:50:53,114 --> 00:50:55,867
Time was l'd have done the same thing.
ln fact--

680
00:51:00,634 --> 00:51:02,465
Hi.

681
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:05,830
Oh, my God.

682
00:51:05,914 --> 00:51:08,303
l just wanted to apologize for
my friend. He's very sensitive.

683
00:51:08,394 --> 00:51:09,793
Uh, look, l'm sorr--

684
00:51:09,874 --> 00:51:12,672
No, no, leave it. lt's, you know--
l'm sure you didn't mean any harm.

685
00:51:12,754 --> 00:51:15,109
l'm sure it was just friendly banter.

686
00:51:15,194 --> 00:51:17,992
l'm sure you guys have dicks
the size of peanuts. Enjoy your dinner.

687
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,952
The tuna's really good.

688
00:51:23,154 --> 00:51:26,430
l shouldn't have done that.
l shouldn't have done that.

689
00:51:26,514 --> 00:51:29,312
- No, you were brilliant.
- l'm rash and l'm stupid.

690
00:51:29,394 --> 00:51:32,352
What am l doing with you ?

691
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:34,948
Uh, l don't know, l'm afraid.

692
00:51:35,034 --> 00:51:36,865
l don't either.

693
00:51:41,194 --> 00:51:43,662
Here we are.

694
00:51:43,754 --> 00:51:45,585
Yes.

695
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:49,304
- Well, look--
- Do you wanna come up ?

696
00:51:51,514 --> 00:51:56,190
Well, there seems to be...
lots of reasons why l shouldn't, so--

697
00:51:56,274 --> 00:51:59,072
There are lots of reasons.

698
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:05,306
Do you wanna come up ?

699
00:52:08,594 --> 00:52:10,710
Give me five minutes ?

700
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:35,111
To be able to do that
is such a wonderful thing.

701
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:37,105
- You've got to go.
- Why ?

702
00:52:37,194 --> 00:52:42,109
Because my boyfriend who was in America
is, in fact, now in the next room.

703
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:44,310
- Boyfriend ?
- Yes.

704
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:47,830
- Baby, who is it ?
- Uh, it's, uh--

705
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,547
- Uh--
- Uh, room service.

706
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:56,071
Oh. How you doing ? l thought you guys
always wore those, uh, penguin coats.

707
00:52:57,114 --> 00:52:58,945
Usually we do.

708
00:52:59,034 --> 00:53:01,753
But l was just, uh--
just changed to go home.

709
00:53:01,834 --> 00:53:05,873
And, um, then l thought
l'd take this final call.

710
00:53:05,954 --> 00:53:08,548
Oh, great. lf you don't mind,
l would like something too.

711
00:53:08,634 --> 00:53:11,102
Could you bring me up some
really, really cold water ?

712
00:53:11,194 --> 00:53:13,469
l'll see what l can do.

713
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:17,786
- Still, not sparkling.
- Absolutely. lce-cold still water.

714
00:53:17,874 --> 00:53:21,150
Unless it's illegal in the U.K. to serve
beverages below room temperature.

715
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:24,943
l wouldn't want you going to jail
just to satisfy my whim, now.

716
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:26,752
- No, l'm sure it's fine.
- Thank you.

717
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:29,553
Hey, one more thing.

718
00:53:29,634 --> 00:53:32,023
Could you adios these dirty dishes
and take out that trash too ?

719
00:53:34,914 --> 00:53:36,745
- Uh--
- Right.

720
00:53:36,834 --> 00:53:39,143
No. No. Um, don't-- don't--
don't do that.

721
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:41,509
l don't think
it's his job to clear.

722
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:45,633
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
What's your name, man ?

723
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:48,705
Bernie.

724
00:53:48,794 --> 00:53:50,910
Oh, listen, Bernie.

725
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,145
Thank you.
l really appreciate it.

726
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:56,065
Hey, you.

727
00:54:00,314 --> 00:54:05,024
So, tell me. Tell me, tell me.
Good surprise or nasty surprise ?

728
00:54:05,114 --> 00:54:07,787
- Good surprise.
- Oh, you're such a liar.

729
00:54:07,874 --> 00:54:10,183
She hates surprises.
Hey, what are you gonna order ?

730
00:54:10,274 --> 00:54:13,072
- Huh ?
- From him. What are you gonna order ?

731
00:54:13,154 --> 00:54:15,304
Um, l haven't decided yet.

732
00:54:15,394 --> 00:54:17,464
Oh, well, don't overdo it.

733
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:21,433
l don't want people saying,
""There goes that famous actor
with the big, fat girlfriend.""

734
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:25,625
l should leave.

735
00:54:31,594 --> 00:54:34,904
This is a fairly strange reality
to be faced with.

736
00:54:36,194 --> 00:54:38,071
l'm so sorry.

737
00:54:40,674 --> 00:54:42,869
l don't know...

738
00:54:42,954 --> 00:54:45,149
what to say.

739
00:54:45,234 --> 00:54:47,384
Well,

740
00:54:47,474 --> 00:54:49,510
l think, um,

741
00:54:49,594 --> 00:54:52,666
""goodbye"" is traditional.

742
00:56:50,314 --> 00:56:52,544
Come on.

743
00:56:52,634 --> 00:56:55,387
Open up.

744
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:59,069
This is me.
Spikey.

745
00:57:00,554 --> 00:57:04,593
l'm in contact with some quite
important spiritual vibrations.

746
00:57:06,194 --> 00:57:09,869
Come on.
Hit me with it.

747
00:57:13,474 --> 00:57:16,227
- There's this girl--
- Aha.

748
00:57:16,314 --> 00:57:19,943
See, l been gettin' a female vibe.
Good.

749
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:22,548
Speak on, dear friend.

750
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:25,068
She's someone who...

751
00:57:25,154 --> 00:57:28,112
can't be mine, and, uh,

752
00:57:30,234 --> 00:57:35,467
it's as if l've taken love heroin,
and now l can't ever have it again.

753
00:57:35,554 --> 00:57:38,626
l've opened Pandora's box
and there's trouble inside.

754
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:44,943
Yeah.

755
00:57:45,034 --> 00:57:47,502
Tricky.

756
00:57:47,594 --> 00:57:49,425
Tricky.

757
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:54,666
l knew a girl at school
called Pandora.

758
00:57:57,394 --> 00:58:00,306
Never got to see her box or--

759
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,225
Right.

760
00:58:02,314 --> 00:58:05,863
Right. Thanks. That's very helpful.

761
00:58:07,594 --> 00:58:11,030
You didn't know
she had a boyfriend ?

762
00:58:13,554 --> 00:58:15,431
Why ? Did you ?

763
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:18,984
Oh, bloody hell.
l don't believe it.

764
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:23,033
My whole life ruined because
l don't read Hello magazine.

765
00:58:23,114 --> 00:58:26,789
Let's face facts.
This was always a no-win situation.

766
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:30,583
Anna's... a goddess.

767
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,586
You know what happens to mortals
who get involved with the gods.

768
00:58:33,674 --> 00:58:36,347
- Buggered, is it ?
- Every time.

769
00:58:36,434 --> 00:58:41,110
But don't despair. l think l have
the solution to your problems.

770
00:58:41,194 --> 00:58:43,833
- Really ?
- Mm-hmm. Her name is Tessa.

771
00:58:43,914 --> 00:58:45,666
She works in the Contracts Department.

772
00:58:45,754 --> 00:58:48,905
The hair, l admit,
is unfashionably frizzy,

773
00:58:48,994 --> 00:58:52,782
but she's bright as a button and kisses
like a nymphomaniac on death row.

774
00:58:52,874 --> 00:58:55,069
Apparently.

775
00:58:57,514 --> 00:59:00,028
Now... try.

776
00:59:02,954 --> 00:59:05,024
l got completely lost.

777
00:59:05,114 --> 00:59:07,674
lt's very difficult, isn't it ?
Everything's got the word
""Kensington"" in it.

778
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:10,985
Kensington Park Road. Kensington Garden.
Kensington bloody Park Garden.

779
00:59:11,074 --> 00:59:13,463
- Tessa, this is Bella, my wife.
- Hello.

780
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,545
- You're in a wheelchair.
- That's right.

781
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:17,943
And this is William.

782
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:20,264
- Hello, William.
- Hi.

783
00:59:20,354 --> 00:59:23,266
- Max has told me everything about you.
- Has he ?

784
00:59:23,354 --> 00:59:25,868
Oh, yes.
You are a naughty boy.

785
00:59:25,954 --> 00:59:28,149
- Wine ?
- Oh, yes, please.

786
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:30,190
Come on, Willie.
Let's get sloshed.

787
00:59:30,274 --> 00:59:32,230
- Red or white ?
- Red.

788
00:59:34,794 --> 00:59:37,024
Keziah.

789
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:41,591
- Some woodcock ?
- No, thank you. l'm a fruitarian.

790
00:59:45,434 --> 00:59:48,107
What is a fruitarian, exactly ?

791
00:59:48,194 --> 00:59:51,823
We believe that
fruits and vegetables have feelings,

792
00:59:51,914 --> 00:59:54,109
so we think cooking is cruel.

793
00:59:54,194 --> 00:59:58,028
We only eat things that have actually
fallen from the tree or bush,

794
00:59:58,114 --> 01:00:00,230
that are, in fact, dead already.

795
01:00:01,954 --> 01:00:06,027
Ah. Oh, right.

796
01:00:06,114 --> 01:00:07,945
Right.

797
01:00:08,034 --> 01:00:10,104
So, um, these carrots ?

798
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:12,708
- Have been murdered, yes.
- Murdered.

799
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:17,186
Poor old carrots.
That's--

800
01:00:17,274 --> 01:00:19,105
That's beastly.

801
01:00:22,354 --> 01:00:25,312
Delicious coffee.

802
01:00:25,394 --> 01:00:27,828
l'm sorry about the lamb.

803
01:00:27,914 --> 01:00:32,465
No. l thought it was...
really, you know, interesting.

804
01:00:32,554 --> 01:00:35,466
lnteresting means inedible.

805
01:00:35,554 --> 01:00:38,830
Really inedible. Yes, you're right.

806
01:00:41,474 --> 01:00:45,069
Well, maybe we'll meet again.

807
01:00:45,154 --> 01:00:48,669
Yeah, yeah.
That would be, uh--

808
01:00:48,754 --> 01:00:50,631
be great.

809
01:00:57,834 --> 01:00:59,711
Bye.

810
01:01:17,994 --> 01:01:20,383
Well ?

811
01:01:20,474 --> 01:01:22,305
Perfect.

812
01:01:22,394 --> 01:01:24,510
Absolutely perfect.

813
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:29,593
And ?

814
01:01:29,674 --> 01:01:33,303
l think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.

815
01:01:35,394 --> 01:01:39,626
To find someone you actually... love,
who'll love you.

816
01:01:39,714 --> 01:01:42,467
The chances are always minuscule.

817
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,705
Look at me.

818
01:01:45,794 --> 01:01:50,151
Apart from the American, l've only
loved two girls, both total disasters.

819
01:01:50,234 --> 01:01:52,190
- That's not fair.
- One of them marries me,
then leaves me...

820
01:01:52,274 --> 01:01:55,186
faster than you can say
""lndiana Jones.""

821
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:58,550
And the other-- who seriously
ought to have known better--

822
01:01:58,634 --> 01:02:00,511
casually marries my best friend.

823
01:02:00,594 --> 01:02:04,553
- She still loves you, though.
- ln a depressingly asexual way.

824
01:02:06,634 --> 01:02:08,750
l never fancied you much, actually.

825
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:12,224
Oh, God.

826
01:02:12,314 --> 01:02:15,829
l loved you.
You were terribly funny, but...

827
01:02:15,914 --> 01:02:18,064
all that kissing my ears.

828
01:02:18,154 --> 01:02:20,714
l don't believe it.
This is just getting worse.

829
01:02:20,794 --> 01:02:23,388
l shall find myself 30 years from now
still sitting on this sofa.

830
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:28,469
- Do you wanna stay ?
- Yeah. Why not ?

831
01:02:28,554 --> 01:02:31,227
All that awaits me at home
is a masturbating Welshman.

832
01:02:35,154 --> 01:02:37,110
Here we go.

833
01:02:37,194 --> 01:02:39,071
- Good night.
- Night.

834
01:02:57,394 --> 01:02:59,385
- See you.
- Right.

835
01:03:07,394 --> 01:03:09,624
Guilty.
Very, very guilty.

836
01:03:09,714 --> 01:03:11,591
So it seems.

837
01:03:57,114 --> 01:03:59,582
Hi.

838
01:04:01,194 --> 01:04:03,310
Can l come in ?

839
01:04:03,394 --> 01:04:05,225
Come in.

840
01:04:12,234 --> 01:04:15,192
They were taken years ago.

841
01:04:15,274 --> 01:04:18,072
l know it was--

842
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:22,591
But l was poor and--
lt happens a lot.

843
01:04:22,674 --> 01:04:24,949
That's not an excuse.
l just--

844
01:04:27,474 --> 01:04:30,511
But to make matters worse,

845
01:04:30,594 --> 01:04:33,666
it now appears as though...

846
01:04:33,754 --> 01:04:37,588
someone was filming me as well.

847
01:04:37,674 --> 01:04:41,269
So what was a stupid
photo shoot...

848
01:04:41,354 --> 01:04:43,549
now looks like a porn film.

849
01:04:45,954 --> 01:04:48,866
The pictures have been sold
and they're just...

850
01:04:48,954 --> 01:04:50,785
everywhere.

851
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:56,144
l didn't know where to go.

852
01:04:58,554 --> 01:05:00,385
The hotel's surrounded.

853
01:05:04,474 --> 01:05:07,625
l know it's been months, but--

854
01:05:07,714 --> 01:05:09,989
This is the place.

855
01:05:12,234 --> 01:05:14,429
Thank you.

856
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:19,823
l'm just in London...

857
01:05:19,914 --> 01:05:22,633
for two days,
but what with your papers,

858
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:25,512
it's the worst place to be.

859
01:05:25,594 --> 01:05:29,269
These pictures are just so horrible,
and they're so grainy.

860
01:05:29,354 --> 01:05:31,185
lt makes me look like--

861
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:33,230
Don't think about it.

862
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:37,669
We'll sort it out.

863
01:05:40,474 --> 01:05:44,626
What would you like ?
Tea ?

864
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:46,591
Bath ?

865
01:05:50,474 --> 01:05:53,511
A bath would be great.

866
01:05:55,594 --> 01:05:57,425
Oh, Christ alive !

867
01:06:01,954 --> 01:06:04,229
Brilliant. Fantastic.

868
01:06:07,594 --> 01:06:09,630
Magnificent.

869
01:06:15,874 --> 01:06:17,705
You must be Spike.

870
01:06:30,834 --> 01:06:34,224
- Hi.
- Just...

871
01:06:34,314 --> 01:06:36,145
checkin'.

872
01:06:40,754 --> 01:06:42,631
Thank you, God.

873
01:06:46,314 --> 01:06:48,669
l'm really sorry about last time.

874
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:51,029
- Oh--
- He just flew in.

875
01:06:51,114 --> 01:06:52,945
- l had no idea.
- All right.

876
01:06:53,034 --> 01:06:57,425
ln fact, l had no idea
if he was ever gonna fly in again.

877
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:00,472
lt's not often one
has the opportunity to adios...

878
01:07:00,554 --> 01:07:03,307
the plates of
a major Hollywood film star.

879
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:05,828
lt was, um--
lt was thrilling for me.

880
01:07:09,354 --> 01:07:11,231
So how is he ?

881
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:15,111
l don't know.

882
01:07:17,794 --> 01:07:19,625
lt just got to the point...

883
01:07:19,714 --> 01:07:23,024
where l couldn't remember
any of the reasons why we were together.

884
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:26,151
And you and love ?

885
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:31,631
Oh, well, there's a question, um,

886
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,148
without an interesting answer.

887
01:07:38,114 --> 01:07:39,945
l have thought about you.

888
01:07:41,914 --> 01:07:44,906
- Oh.
- lt's just that...

889
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:48,350
any time l've tried to keep...

890
01:07:48,434 --> 01:07:52,109
anything normal
with a person that was...

891
01:07:52,194 --> 01:07:54,264
normal,
it's just been a disaster.

892
01:07:54,354 --> 01:07:58,506
Listen, l appreciate that.
Absolutely.

893
01:07:58,594 --> 01:08:01,427
So what is that,
a film you're doing ?

894
01:08:01,514 --> 01:08:05,473
Um, start in L.A. on Tuesday.

895
01:08:05,554 --> 01:08:08,466
Would you like me to
take you through your lines ?

896
01:08:08,554 --> 01:08:11,512
Would you ?
'Cause it's all talk, talk, talk.

897
01:08:11,594 --> 01:08:13,664
Hand it over.

898
01:08:14,914 --> 01:08:18,429
Right.
Um, basic plot ?

899
01:08:18,514 --> 01:08:21,426
l'm a difficult but brilliant
junior officer...

900
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:26,190
who in about 20 minutes is gonna
save the world from nuclear disaster.

901
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:28,424
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Well done, you.

902
01:08:28,514 --> 01:08:30,664
""Message from Command. Would you
like them to send in the H.K.'s ?""

903
01:08:30,754 --> 01:08:33,632
No. Turn over four T.R.S.'s
and tell them we need radar feedback...

904
01:08:33,714 --> 01:08:35,545
before the K.F.T.'s return at 1900.

905
01:08:35,634 --> 01:08:39,104
Then inform the Pentagon we'll need
Black Star cover from 1000 through 1215.

906
01:08:39,194 --> 01:08:42,982
And if you say one word about how many
mistakes l made in that speech,
l'll pelt you with olives.

907
01:08:43,074 --> 01:08:45,542
- Very well, Captain.
l'll pass that on straightaway.
- Thank you.

908
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:47,465
- How many mistakes did l make ?
- Eleven.

909
01:08:47,554 --> 01:08:51,627
- Damn it. And Wainwright--
- Cartwright.

910
01:08:51,714 --> 01:08:53,784
Cartwright, Wainwright,
whatever your name is,

911
01:08:53,874 --> 01:08:55,705
l promised little Jimmy
l'd be home for his birthday,

912
01:08:55,794 --> 01:08:58,183
so could you get a message to him
that l may be late.

913
01:08:58,274 --> 01:09:00,344
Certainly.
And, uh, little Johnny ?

914
01:09:00,434 --> 01:09:02,709
- My son's name is Johnny ?
- Yep.

915
01:09:02,794 --> 01:09:05,388
- Then get a message to him too.
- l'll do what l can, Captain,

916
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,305
but l can't promise anything.

917
01:09:07,394 --> 01:09:11,865
And Cartwright goes.

918
01:09:11,954 --> 01:09:15,913
- What do you think ?
- Gripping. lt's not Jane Austen.

919
01:09:15,994 --> 01:09:18,827
lt's not Henry James,
but it's... gripping.

920
01:09:18,914 --> 01:09:22,509
- Think l should do Henry James instead?
- You would be brilliant.

921
01:09:22,594 --> 01:09:27,714
But this writer-- writers--
they're pretty damn good too.

922
01:09:27,794 --> 01:09:30,262
You never get anyone
on Wings of the Dove saying,

923
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:33,027
""lnform the Pentagon
we need Black Star cover.""

924
01:09:33,114 --> 01:09:34,945
For me the book is the poorer for it.

925
01:09:40,034 --> 01:09:42,343
l can't believe you have that picture.

926
01:09:43,874 --> 01:09:46,183
You like Chagall ?

927
01:09:46,274 --> 01:09:50,745
l do. lt feels like
how love should be--

928
01:09:50,834 --> 01:09:53,428
floating through a dark blue sky.

929
01:09:53,514 --> 01:09:56,108
With a goat, playing a violin.

930
01:09:56,194 --> 01:09:58,025
Well, yes.

931
01:09:58,114 --> 01:10:01,072
Happiness isn't happiness
without a violin-playing goat.

932
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:23,231
You have big feet.

933
01:10:25,794 --> 01:10:29,787
Yes.
Yes, always have had.

934
01:10:31,554 --> 01:10:34,990
You know what they say
about men with big feet.

935
01:10:36,234 --> 01:10:38,190
No.
What's that ?

936
01:10:38,274 --> 01:10:41,744
Uh, big feet,

937
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:44,394
large... shoes.

938
01:10:49,994 --> 01:10:51,825
The thing that is so irritating...

939
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,145
is that now l'm so fierce
when it comes to nudity clauses.

940
01:10:55,234 --> 01:10:57,828
You actually have... clauses
in your contract about nudity ?

941
01:10:57,914 --> 01:10:59,745
Definitely.

942
01:10:59,834 --> 01:11:03,270
""You may show the dent of the top of the
artist's buttocks, but neither cheek.""

943
01:11:03,354 --> 01:11:06,426
Or if there's
a stunt bottom being used...

944
01:11:06,514 --> 01:11:09,347
""artist must have full consultation.""

945
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:14,383
- You have a stunt bottom ?
- l could have a stunt bottom, yes.

946
01:11:14,474 --> 01:11:18,706
Are people tempted to go
for better bottoms than their own?

947
01:11:18,794 --> 01:11:21,308
Yeah. l would.
This is important stuff.

948
01:11:21,394 --> 01:11:25,228
lt's one hell of a job, isn't it ?
What do you put on your passport ?

949
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,589
""Profession: Mel Gibson's bottom.""

950
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:29,744
Actually, Mel does his own ass work.

951
01:11:29,834 --> 01:11:31,711
- Right.
- Why wouldn't he ?

952
01:11:31,794 --> 01:11:35,707
- Absolutely.
- lt's delicious.

953
01:11:35,794 --> 01:11:38,991
What, the ice cream
or Mel Gibson's bottom ?

954
01:11:39,074 --> 01:11:41,793
Both. Equally.

955
01:11:41,874 --> 01:11:44,388
But you wouldn't necessarily lick both ?

956
01:11:44,474 --> 01:11:48,626
Well, this is tart.

957
01:11:48,714 --> 01:11:50,784
And fuzz-free.

958
01:11:54,714 --> 01:11:57,228
And, uh--

959
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:59,874
Bedroom.
There's clean sheets.

960
01:12:09,354 --> 01:12:11,822
Today's been a good day,

961
01:12:11,914 --> 01:12:14,712
which in the circumstances is...

962
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:17,467
unexpected.

963
01:12:17,554 --> 01:12:19,749
Thank you.

964
01:12:23,154 --> 01:12:26,112
Anyway, um,

965
01:12:26,194 --> 01:12:28,071
time for bed.

966
01:12:29,194 --> 01:12:31,071
Or sofa bed.

967
01:12:37,194 --> 01:12:39,071
Good night.

968
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,031
Good night.

969
01:13:24,754 --> 01:13:26,631
Oh, my God.

970
01:13:34,434 --> 01:13:36,743
Hello ?

971
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:38,665
Hello.

972
01:13:40,354 --> 01:13:43,790
-Spike.
-l wonder if l could have a little word.

973
01:13:43,874 --> 01:13:47,025
- Right.
- l don't want to interfere or anything,

974
01:13:47,114 --> 01:13:49,674
but she's just split up
from her boyfriend, right ?

975
01:13:49,754 --> 01:13:53,383
- Maybe.
- And she's in your house.

976
01:13:54,834 --> 01:13:58,190
- Yes.
- And you get on very well.

977
01:13:59,834 --> 01:14:02,428
- Yes.
- Well, isn't this, perhaps,

978
01:14:02,514 --> 01:14:04,505
a nice opportunity to...

979
01:14:08,114 --> 01:14:09,945
slip her one.

980
01:14:10,034 --> 01:14:11,911
Spike, for God's sakes.
She's in trouble. Get a grip.

981
01:14:11,994 --> 01:14:14,554
You think it's the wrong moment.
Fair enough.

982
01:14:19,514 --> 01:14:21,391
- Do you mind if l have a go ?
- Spike !

983
01:14:21,474 --> 01:14:24,227
- Okay.
- l'll talk to you in the morning.

984
01:14:24,314 --> 01:14:28,865
Okay.
Might be too late, but okay.

985
01:14:38,274 --> 01:14:41,823
Please, sod off.

986
01:14:41,914 --> 01:14:43,745
- Okay. All right.
- No. No, no !

987
01:14:43,834 --> 01:14:47,463
Wait ! l thought you were,
um, someone else.

988
01:14:49,154 --> 01:14:52,749
l thought you were Spike.
l'm thrilled that you're not.

989
01:15:51,794 --> 01:15:53,671
Wow.

990
01:15:55,874 --> 01:15:57,705
What ?

991
01:15:57,794 --> 01:15:59,625
Nothing.

992
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:35,914
lt does strike me as,

993
01:16:35,994 --> 01:16:39,543
well, surreal that l'm allowed
to see you naked.

994
01:16:39,634 --> 01:16:42,467
- You and every person in this country.
- l'm sorry.

995
01:16:43,954 --> 01:16:46,514
What is it about men and nudity, huh ?

996
01:16:46,594 --> 01:16:48,425
Particularly breasts.

997
01:16:48,514 --> 01:16:52,985
- How can you be so interested in them ?
- Well--

998
01:16:53,074 --> 01:16:55,508
But, seriously,
they're just breasts.

999
01:16:55,594 --> 01:16:58,313
Every second person
in the world has them.

1000
01:16:58,394 --> 01:17:01,943
More than that, when you think about it.
Meat Loaf has a very nice pair.

1001
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,344
But they're odd-looking.

1002
01:17:05,434 --> 01:17:08,107
They're for milk.
Your mother has them.

1003
01:17:08,194 --> 01:17:11,550
You've seen a thousand of them.
What's all the fuss about ?

1004
01:17:11,634 --> 01:17:14,751
Actually, l can't think
what it is, really.

1005
01:17:14,834 --> 01:17:17,348
Let me just have a quick look.

1006
01:17:21,794 --> 01:17:24,672
Nope, nope. Beats me.

1007
01:17:27,634 --> 01:17:31,024
Rita Hayworth used to say,

1008
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:34,663
""They go to bed with Gilda,
they wake up with me.""

1009
01:17:34,754 --> 01:17:39,669
- Who was Gilda ?
- Her most famous part.

1010
01:17:39,754 --> 01:17:42,552
Men went to bed with the dream,

1011
01:17:42,634 --> 01:17:46,149
and they didn't like it
when they woke up with the reality.

1012
01:17:47,674 --> 01:17:49,505
Do you feel that way ?

1013
01:17:52,154 --> 01:17:55,703
You are lovelier this morning
than you have ever been.

1014
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,105
l'll be right back.

1015
01:18:14,154 --> 01:18:15,985
Breakfast in bed.

1016
01:18:16,074 --> 01:18:20,272
- Oh.
- Or it's brunch or lunch or something.

1017
01:18:20,354 --> 01:18:22,948
My God.

1018
01:18:23,034 --> 01:18:24,865
Can l stay a bit longer ?

1019
01:18:27,554 --> 01:18:29,385
Stay forever.

1020
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:33,984
Okay.
Oh. Forgot the jam.

1021
01:18:38,154 --> 01:18:40,429
l'll get the jam,
you get the door.

1022
01:18:55,674 --> 01:18:57,471
Jesus Christ.

1023
01:19:00,114 --> 01:19:02,389
What ?

1024
01:19:02,474 --> 01:19:04,704
What is it ?

1025
01:19:04,794 --> 01:19:07,627
- Nothing, really.
- You're up to something.

1026
01:19:07,714 --> 01:19:10,467
Anna, no, please !

1027
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:17,510
My God. And they got a picture of you
dressed like that.

1028
01:19:17,594 --> 01:19:19,266
Yes.

1029
01:19:21,034 --> 01:19:22,911
Undressed like this, yeah.

1030
01:19:24,674 --> 01:19:28,144
- Morning, darling ones.
- lt's me. The press are here.

1031
01:19:28,234 --> 01:19:30,350
No, there are hundreds of them.

1032
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:32,948
My brilliant plan
was not so brilliant. l know.

1033
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:36,151
l know. l know.
Just get over here.

1034
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:38,111
Damn it.

1035
01:19:43,074 --> 01:19:45,986
- Um, l wouldn't go outside.
- Why not ?

1036
01:19:48,554 --> 01:19:51,114
- Just take my word for it.
- Oh.

1037
01:20:12,714 --> 01:20:14,830
How did l look ?
Not bad.

1038
01:20:14,914 --> 01:20:18,748
Not at all bad.
Well-chosen briefs, l'd say.

1039
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:21,394
Chicks love grey.

1040
01:20:21,474 --> 01:20:24,034
Nice firm buttocks.

1041
01:20:27,834 --> 01:20:29,665
How are you doing ?

1042
01:20:29,754 --> 01:20:32,222
How do you think l'm doing ?

1043
01:20:33,594 --> 01:20:35,744
- l don't know what happened.
- l do.

1044
01:20:35,834 --> 01:20:40,544
Your furry friend thought he'd make
a buck telling the papers where l was.

1045
01:20:40,634 --> 01:20:42,465
- That's not true.
- Really ?

1046
01:20:42,554 --> 01:20:45,751
The entire British press
got up this morning and thought,
""l know where Anna Scott is.

1047
01:20:45,834 --> 01:20:48,632
She's in that house with the blue door
in Notting Hill.''

1048
01:20:48,714 --> 01:20:51,353
Then you go out
in your goddam underwear !

1049
01:20:51,434 --> 01:20:54,267
-l went out in my goddam underwear too.
-Get out !

1050
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:56,310
Sorry.

1051
01:20:56,394 --> 01:21:00,069
- l'm so sorry.
- This is such an unbelievable mess.

1052
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:02,952
l come to you to protect myself
against more crappy gossip,

1053
01:21:03,034 --> 01:21:04,865
and now l've landed in it
all over again.

1054
01:21:04,954 --> 01:21:07,673
For God's sake, l've got a boyfriend !

1055
01:21:07,754 --> 01:21:11,303
- You have ?
- As far as they're concerned l do.

1056
01:21:11,394 --> 01:21:16,024
And now, tomorrow there'll be
pictures of you in every newspaper
from here to Timbuktu !

1057
01:21:16,114 --> 01:21:18,947
l know that, but...
just let's stay calm.

1058
01:21:19,034 --> 01:21:22,629
You stay calm ! This is a perfect
situation for you, isn't it?

1059
01:21:22,714 --> 01:21:24,944
Minimum input, maximum publicity.

1060
01:21:25,034 --> 01:21:27,502
Everywhere you go, people will say,
""Well done, you.

1061
01:21:27,594 --> 01:21:31,223
You slept with that actress.
We saw the pictures.''

1062
01:21:31,314 --> 01:21:33,953
- That is spectacularly unfair.
- That's yours.

1063
01:21:34,034 --> 01:21:35,865
Maybe it'll even help business.

1064
01:21:35,954 --> 01:21:38,422
Buy a boring book about Egypt
from the guy that screwed Anna Scott.

1065
01:21:38,514 --> 01:21:42,143
Stop ! Stop ! l beg you !

1066
01:21:42,234 --> 01:21:44,384
Calm down.
How about a cup of tea ?

1067
01:21:44,474 --> 01:21:46,465
l don't want
a goddam cup of tea.

1068
01:21:47,794 --> 01:21:50,354
l just wanna go home.

1069
01:21:50,434 --> 01:21:53,073
Spike, see who that is,
and put some clothes on, for God's sake.

1070
01:21:53,154 --> 01:21:55,668
Looks like a chauffeur to me.

1071
01:21:55,754 --> 01:21:58,063
Spike owes you
an expensive dinner or holiday,

1072
01:21:58,154 --> 01:22:01,066
depending who's got the brains
to get the going rate on betrayal.

1073
01:22:01,154 --> 01:22:02,985
That is not true.
Wait a minute.

1074
01:22:03,074 --> 01:22:05,634
This is crazy behaviour.

1075
01:22:05,714 --> 01:22:08,831
Can't we just
laugh about all this ?

1076
01:22:08,914 --> 01:22:12,463
Seriously. ln the huge sweep of things,
this stuff doesn't matter.

1077
01:22:12,554 --> 01:22:15,626
What he's gonna say next is
there's people starving in the Sudan.

1078
01:22:15,714 --> 01:22:19,309
Well, there are, and we don't
have to go anywhere near that far.

1079
01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:22,192
My best friend slipped down stairs,
cracked her back...

1080
01:22:22,274 --> 01:22:24,708
and she's in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life.

1081
01:22:24,794 --> 01:22:28,946
All l'm asking for is
a normal amount of perspective.

1082
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:31,423
You're right.
Of course, you're right.

1083
01:22:31,514 --> 01:22:34,187
lt's just that l've dealt
with this garbage for ten years.

1084
01:22:34,274 --> 01:22:36,105
You've had it for ten minutes.

1085
01:22:36,194 --> 01:22:39,504
Our perspectives are very different.

1086
01:22:39,594 --> 01:22:42,950
Today's newspapers will be lining
tomorrow's wastepaper bin.

1087
01:22:43,034 --> 01:22:45,070
- Excuse me ?
- You know.

1088
01:22:45,154 --> 01:22:47,224
lt's just one day.

1089
01:22:47,314 --> 01:22:50,750
Tomorrow, today's papers
will all have been thrown out.

1090
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:52,904
You really don't get it.

1091
01:22:52,994 --> 01:22:55,303
This story will be filed.

1092
01:22:55,394 --> 01:23:00,070
Every time anyone writes anything
about me, they'll dig up these photos.

1093
01:23:00,154 --> 01:23:02,065
Newspapers last forever.

1094
01:23:02,154 --> 01:23:04,873
l'll regret this forever.

1095
01:23:06,914 --> 01:23:08,745
Right.

1096
01:23:11,914 --> 01:23:14,189
Right.

1097
01:23:14,274 --> 01:23:16,424
l will feel the opposite,

1098
01:23:16,514 --> 01:23:20,473
if that's okay by you, and, uh,

1099
01:23:20,554 --> 01:23:23,432
always be glad that you...
came to stay.

1100
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,632
But, um, you're probably right.

1101
01:23:28,714 --> 01:23:30,545
You better go.

1102
01:24:09,594 --> 01:24:11,744
Was it you ?

1103
01:24:13,994 --> 01:24:18,624
l may have told a few people
down at the pub.

1104
01:24:20,354 --> 01:24:22,185
Right.

1105
01:26:07,394 --> 01:26:10,989
Have l got something for you. Something
which will make you love me so much,

1106
01:26:11,074 --> 01:26:14,225
you will want to hug me every day
for the rest of my life.

1107
01:26:14,314 --> 01:26:17,112
Blimey. What is it ?

1108
01:26:17,194 --> 01:26:19,310
Phone number of Anna Scott's agent
in London...

1109
01:26:19,394 --> 01:26:21,828
and her agent in New York.

1110
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:28,825
Listen, you think about her all
the time. Now you can ring her.

1111
01:26:28,914 --> 01:26:32,304
Yeah. Brilliant. Thanks.

1112
01:26:32,394 --> 01:26:35,272
l'll see you tonight.
Hey, Marty. Ooh ! Sexy cardi.

1113
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:04,432
Shh ! Hello !
l have a little speech to make.

1114
01:27:04,514 --> 01:27:09,190
l won't stand up because
l can't... be bothered.

1115
01:27:09,274 --> 01:27:13,825
Exactly a year ago today, this man here
started the finest restaurant in London.

1116
01:27:13,914 --> 01:27:15,745
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you very much.

1117
01:27:15,834 --> 01:27:18,268
Unfortunately,
no one ever came to eat here.

1118
01:27:18,354 --> 01:27:21,073
lt's a tiny hiccup.

1119
01:27:21,154 --> 01:27:24,305
And so we have to face the fact
that from next week,

1120
01:27:24,394 --> 01:27:26,225
we must find somewhere new to eat.

1121
01:27:27,554 --> 01:27:31,672
l just want to say to Tony...
don't take it personally.

1122
01:27:31,754 --> 01:27:35,429
The more l think about things, the more
l see no rhyme or reason in life.

1123
01:27:35,514 --> 01:27:39,029
No one knows why some things work out
and some things don't.

1124
01:27:39,114 --> 01:27:40,832
Why some of us get lucky...

1125
01:27:40,914 --> 01:27:43,951
- and some of us--
- Get fired.

1126
01:27:44,034 --> 01:27:45,262
- What ?
- No !

1127
01:27:45,354 --> 01:27:47,993
Yeah, well, it seems
they're shifting the whole outfit...

1128
01:27:48,074 --> 01:27:50,542
much more towards
the emerging markets.

1129
01:27:50,634 --> 01:27:55,071
And, of course, well,
l was total crap, so--

1130
01:27:55,154 --> 01:27:57,304
A toast to Bernie-- the worst
stockbroker in the whole world.

1131
01:27:57,394 --> 01:27:59,988
l thank you.
And Tony, the worst restaurateur.

1132
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,542
- Tony and Bernie. Both crap...
- The terrible two.

1133
01:28:02,634 --> 01:28:05,194
in their own special ways.

1134
01:28:07,834 --> 01:28:10,143
Since it's an evening
of announcements,

1135
01:28:10,234 --> 01:28:13,465
uh, l've also got one.

1136
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:16,626
Um, l've decided to get engaged.

1137
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:21,913
l've found myself a nice,
slightly odd-looking bloke...

1138
01:28:21,994 --> 01:28:25,066
who l know is gonna make me happy
for the rest of my life.

1139
01:28:26,674 --> 01:28:29,234
Wait a sec. l mean, l--

1140
01:28:29,314 --> 01:28:33,148
l'm your brother. l don't know
anything about this. ls he--

1141
01:28:33,234 --> 01:28:36,624
ls he financially viable ?

1142
01:28:36,714 --> 01:28:39,274
He's an artist...
with brilliant prospects.

1143
01:28:41,754 --> 01:28:44,746
This is a secret
you've been keeping from me.

1144
01:28:44,834 --> 01:28:46,790
By the way, it's you.

1145
01:28:49,994 --> 01:28:53,031
- Me ?
- What do you think ?

1146
01:28:54,794 --> 01:28:56,671
Well, yeah.

1147
01:28:58,634 --> 01:29:00,864
Groovy.

1148
01:29:00,954 --> 01:29:04,993
Excuse me.
Are there any more announcements ?

1149
01:29:05,074 --> 01:29:07,508
Well, actually, yes.

1150
01:29:07,594 --> 01:29:10,392
l feel l should
apologize to everyone...

1151
01:29:10,474 --> 01:29:12,749
for my behaviour
over the last six months.

1152
01:29:12,834 --> 01:29:16,304
l have, as you know,
been somewhat down in the mouth.

1153
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:19,784
There's an understatement.
There are dead people on better form.

1154
01:29:19,874 --> 01:29:23,423
But l just wish to make it clear
that l've turned a corner,

1155
01:29:23,514 --> 01:29:27,427
and, um, henceforward intend
to be impressively happy.

1156
01:29:33,194 --> 01:29:36,903
Without a love of my own

1157
01:29:40,754 --> 01:29:44,827
-Blue moon
-Ba-boom, ba-boom

1158
01:29:44,914 --> 01:29:48,190
You knew just what l was there for

1159
01:29:48,274 --> 01:29:51,027
Oh, God. l'm horribly drunk.

1160
01:29:51,114 --> 01:29:54,072
You heard me saying a prayer for

1161
01:29:54,154 --> 01:29:56,145
- Come here.
-Ba-boom, ba-boom

1162
01:29:56,234 --> 01:29:59,271
Someone l really could care for

1163
01:29:59,354 --> 01:30:03,506
So you've laid the ghost ?

1164
01:30:03,594 --> 01:30:05,391
l believe l have.

1165
01:30:05,474 --> 01:30:08,671
Don't give a damn
about the famous girl?

1166
01:30:08,754 --> 01:30:10,472
No.

1167
01:30:10,554 --> 01:30:13,227
No, l don't think l do.

1168
01:30:13,314 --> 01:30:16,067
Which means you won't be distracted
by the fact that she's back in London...

1169
01:30:16,154 --> 01:30:17,746
grasping her Oscar...

1170
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:20,712
and currently to be found filming,
most days, on Hampstead Heath.

1171
01:30:22,474 --> 01:30:24,351
Oh, God, no.

1172
01:30:27,474 --> 01:30:30,147
So not over her, in fact.

1173
01:31:11,914 --> 01:31:14,712
- Can l help you ?
- Yeah, l'm, um--

1174
01:31:14,794 --> 01:31:17,069
- l'm looking for Anna Scott.
- Does she know you're coming ?

1175
01:31:17,154 --> 01:31:20,464
No. No, uh, she doesn't.

1176
01:31:20,554 --> 01:31:23,705
- l'm afraid l can't let you through.
- Right.

1177
01:31:23,794 --> 01:31:28,584
l mean, l am actually a friend.
l'm not a lunatic, but--

1178
01:31:28,674 --> 01:31:31,427
- No, you basically, er--
- Can't let you through, sir.

1179
01:32:11,634 --> 01:32:13,033
Well, this is, uh--

1180
01:32:13,114 --> 01:32:16,311
l only found out
you were here yesterday.

1181
01:32:16,394 --> 01:32:19,989
- l was going to call, but l--
- Uh, Anna.

1182
01:32:20,074 --> 01:32:22,429
Yes. Um--

1183
01:32:22,514 --> 01:32:24,823
Things aren't going very well,
and it's our last day.

1184
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:27,223
Absolutely, yeah.
You're clearly very busy.

1185
01:32:27,314 --> 01:32:29,623
But if-- if you could wait,

1186
01:32:29,714 --> 01:32:32,274
there are... things to say.

1187
01:32:36,554 --> 01:32:38,431
Okay.

1188
01:32:40,274 --> 01:32:43,072
Drink tea.
There's lots of tea.

1189
01:32:49,234 --> 01:32:51,111
Come and have a look.

1190
01:32:55,274 --> 01:32:58,311
Are you a fan of Henry James ?

1191
01:32:58,394 --> 01:33:01,033
- This is a Henry James film ?
- Yeah.

1192
01:33:07,954 --> 01:33:10,070
This is, uh, Harry.

1193
01:33:10,154 --> 01:33:13,226
He'll give you a pair of headphones
so you can hear the dialogue.

1194
01:33:13,314 --> 01:33:15,145
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

1195
01:33:15,234 --> 01:33:17,748
- Hi.
- Hi. Here we go.

1196
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:21,190
- Volume's on the side. Have a seat.
- Thank you.

1197
01:33:29,074 --> 01:33:32,384
We are living in cloud cuckoo land.
We'll never get this done today.

1198
01:33:32,474 --> 01:33:34,624
We've got to.
l have to be in New York on Thursday.

1199
01:33:34,714 --> 01:33:38,707
Oh, stop showing off.
God, that's an enormous ass.

1200
01:33:38,794 --> 01:33:42,833
- l'm not listening.
- But seriously, it's not fair.

1201
01:33:42,914 --> 01:33:45,109
So many tragic young teenagers
with anorexia...

1202
01:33:45,194 --> 01:33:47,708
and that girl has an ass
she could perfectly well share around...

1203
01:33:47,794 --> 01:33:51,503
with at least ten other women
and still be big-bottomed.

1204
01:33:51,594 --> 01:33:53,983
l would think, looking at
something nice like that,

1205
01:33:54,074 --> 01:33:58,067
you and your...
bony little excuse for an arse...

1206
01:33:58,154 --> 01:34:00,224
would be well advised to keep quiet.

1207
01:34:00,314 --> 01:34:02,191
Now down to business.
The end of the scene.

1208
01:34:02,274 --> 01:34:05,311
Um, l ask you when you're
telling everyone, and you say--

1209
01:34:05,394 --> 01:34:09,387
Um, tomorrow will be soon enough.

1210
01:34:09,474 --> 01:34:11,783
And then l-- Right. Okay.

1211
01:34:11,874 --> 01:34:15,503
Say, who was that rather diffident chap
l saw you talking to round the back ?

1212
01:34:15,594 --> 01:34:17,471
No one.

1213
01:34:18,794 --> 01:34:21,706
Just some guy from the past. l--

1214
01:34:21,794 --> 01:34:25,548
lt's a bit of an awkward situation.
l don't know what he's doing here.

1215
01:34:41,994 --> 01:34:43,825
'Course.

1216
01:34:49,354 --> 01:34:52,312
Thanks. l've got to, um--

1217
01:34:52,394 --> 01:34:54,271
Any time.

1218
01:35:03,434 --> 01:35:06,710
Ladies and gentlemen,
can we have you on your first marks ?

1219
01:35:06,794 --> 01:35:08,864
On your first marks !

1220
01:35:20,474 --> 01:35:23,671
Uh, l-l do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

1221
01:35:23,754 --> 01:35:26,791
but, uh, there's a delivery for you.

1222
01:35:26,874 --> 01:35:29,104
Martin, really.
Can't you just do it yourself ?

1223
01:35:29,194 --> 01:35:33,551
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

1224
01:35:34,594 --> 01:35:36,107
Right. Okay.

1225
01:35:36,194 --> 01:35:40,710
Tell me, if l employ a wet rag, would l
have to pay it as much as l pay you ?

1226
01:35:44,714 --> 01:35:45,863
Hi.

1227
01:35:47,474 --> 01:35:49,465
Hello.

1228
01:35:49,554 --> 01:35:51,590
You disappeared.

1229
01:35:51,674 --> 01:35:54,188
Yeah. Yeah. Um--

1230
01:35:54,274 --> 01:35:57,949
l had to leave.
l didn't want to disturb.

1231
01:35:58,034 --> 01:36:01,868
- How have you been ?
- Fine, fine. Everything much the same.

1232
01:36:01,954 --> 01:36:05,867
When they change the law,
Spike and l will marry immediately.

1233
01:36:05,954 --> 01:36:08,866
Whereas you, l've watched in wonder.

1234
01:36:08,954 --> 01:36:11,070
- Awards, glory.
- Oh, no.

1235
01:36:11,154 --> 01:36:14,430
lt's-- lt's all nonsense, believe me.

1236
01:36:14,514 --> 01:36:17,347
l'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but...

1237
01:36:17,434 --> 01:36:19,265
nonsense it all is.

1238
01:36:21,354 --> 01:36:23,709
Well, um--

1239
01:36:23,794 --> 01:36:28,629
Yesterday was our last day of filming,
so... l'm leaving.

1240
01:36:30,674 --> 01:36:33,984
But, um--

1241
01:36:34,074 --> 01:36:37,544
l brought this for you from home,

1242
01:36:37,634 --> 01:36:39,750
so l thought l'd give it to you.

1243
01:36:41,154 --> 01:36:43,952
Thank you.

1244
01:36:44,034 --> 01:36:45,865
Shall l--

1245
01:36:45,954 --> 01:36:48,422
Oh, no, don't open it now.
l'll be embarrassed.

1246
01:36:51,154 --> 01:36:54,385
Well, thank you. l don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

1247
01:36:54,474 --> 01:36:58,786
Actually, l had it in my apartment,
and l thought you'd--

1248
01:37:01,074 --> 01:37:03,747
But when it came to it,
l didn't know how to call,

1249
01:37:03,834 --> 01:37:06,792
having behaved so badly.

1250
01:37:06,874 --> 01:37:08,705
Twice.

1251
01:37:10,274 --> 01:37:14,233
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

1252
01:37:14,314 --> 01:37:18,466
Then you came and... l figured--

1253
01:37:21,994 --> 01:37:24,224
The thing is--

1254
01:37:24,314 --> 01:37:26,145
The thing is--

1255
01:37:28,834 --> 01:37:31,587
What ? What is the thing ?

1256
01:37:32,794 --> 01:37:35,024
Don't even think about it.
Go away immediately.

1257
01:37:35,114 --> 01:37:37,628
- Go away.
- Right.

1258
01:37:37,714 --> 01:37:39,591
Sorry.

1259
01:37:41,754 --> 01:37:44,063
You were saying ?

1260
01:37:46,474 --> 01:37:49,784
Yes.

1261
01:37:49,874 --> 01:37:52,593
l have to go away today, but l...

1262
01:37:52,674 --> 01:37:55,825
wondered if l didn't...

1263
01:37:55,914 --> 01:38:00,112
whether you might
let me see you a little,

1264
01:38:00,194 --> 01:38:02,947
or... a lot, maybe.

1265
01:38:06,074 --> 01:38:08,827
See if you could like me again.

1266
01:38:08,914 --> 01:38:11,223
But yesterday
that actor asked you who l was,

1267
01:38:11,314 --> 01:38:13,987
and you just
dismissed me out of hand.

1268
01:38:15,274 --> 01:38:18,232
l heard.

1269
01:38:18,314 --> 01:38:21,386
You had a microphone.
l had headphones.

1270
01:38:21,474 --> 01:38:23,351
You expect me
to tell the truth about my life...

1271
01:38:23,434 --> 01:38:25,948
to the most indiscreet man
in England ?

1272
01:38:27,314 --> 01:38:29,544
Uh, excuse me.

1273
01:38:29,634 --> 01:38:31,943
lt's your mother on the phone.

1274
01:38:34,634 --> 01:38:36,625
Will you tell her
l'll ring her back ?

1275
01:38:36,714 --> 01:38:39,672
l've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

1276
01:38:39,754 --> 01:38:41,631
and it's now been about 24 hours...

1277
01:38:41,714 --> 01:38:44,990
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in colour and--

1278
01:38:45,074 --> 01:38:48,703
Right, right. Yeah.
Perfect timing, as ever.

1279
01:38:50,794 --> 01:38:53,433
Martin, hold the fort a second.

1280
01:38:53,514 --> 01:38:55,789
Uh, yes. All right.

1281
01:39:00,714 --> 01:39:03,148
Um, could l just say--

1282
01:39:03,234 --> 01:39:08,069
l thought Ghost
was the most wonderful film.

1283
01:39:09,274 --> 01:39:11,834
- ls that right ?
- Oh, yes.

1284
01:39:14,914 --> 01:39:18,623
Um, l've always wondered...

1285
01:39:18,714 --> 01:39:21,751
what Patrick Swayze's like
in-- in-- in real life.

1286
01:39:21,834 --> 01:39:25,349
l can't say that l know Patrick
all that well.

1287
01:39:25,434 --> 01:39:27,584
He wasn't that friendly during filming ?

1288
01:39:27,674 --> 01:39:32,873
Well, l'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.

1289
01:39:35,274 --> 01:39:37,504
Oh. Oh, right.

1290
01:39:37,594 --> 01:39:39,425
Sorry.

1291
01:39:41,034 --> 01:39:44,151
Always been a bit of an ass.

1292
01:39:44,234 --> 01:39:47,032
Um, anyway-- Um--

1293
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:48,945
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

1294
01:39:49,034 --> 01:39:51,343
l'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

1295
01:39:51,434 --> 01:39:54,949
And Demi's, of course.

1296
01:39:57,354 --> 01:39:59,470
Sorry.

1297
01:39:59,554 --> 01:40:01,306
That's fine.

1298
01:40:01,394 --> 01:40:05,023
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

1299
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:10,226
Anna, look, um--

1300
01:40:10,314 --> 01:40:13,943
l'm a fairly levelheaded bloke,

1301
01:40:14,034 --> 01:40:17,743
not often in and out of love.

1302
01:40:17,834 --> 01:40:19,870
But, uh--

1303
01:40:24,234 --> 01:40:26,509
Can l just say no to your...

1304
01:40:26,594 --> 01:40:30,746
kind request and, uh, leave it at that ?

1305
01:40:33,994 --> 01:40:37,191
Yes.

1306
01:40:37,274 --> 01:40:40,630
Fine. Of course. l--

1307
01:40:40,714 --> 01:40:42,705
Of course.

1308
01:40:44,354 --> 01:40:47,266
l'll just be going, then.
lt was nice to see you.

1309
01:40:47,354 --> 01:40:50,152
The thing is,

1310
01:40:50,234 --> 01:40:53,544
with you l'm in real... danger.

1311
01:40:53,634 --> 01:40:56,671
lt seems like a... perfect situation,

1312
01:40:56,754 --> 01:41:00,064
apart from that
foul temper of yours, but...

1313
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:04,511
my relatively inexperienced heart
would, l fear, not...

1314
01:41:04,594 --> 01:41:07,267
recover, uh, if l was...

1315
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:11,233
once again cast aside,
as l would absolutely expect to be.

1316
01:41:11,314 --> 01:41:16,263
There are just too many pictures of you,
too many films.

1317
01:41:16,354 --> 01:41:19,551
You'd go and l'd be, uh,

1318
01:41:19,634 --> 01:41:22,148
well, buggered, basically.

1319
01:41:23,594 --> 01:41:26,392
That really is a real no, isn't it ?

1320
01:41:26,474 --> 01:41:30,990
l live in Notting Hill.
You live in... Beverly Hills.

1321
01:41:31,074 --> 01:41:32,905
Everyone in the world
knows who you are.

1322
01:41:32,994 --> 01:41:36,543
My mother has trouble
remembering my name.

1323
01:41:36,634 --> 01:41:38,465
Fine.

1324
01:41:40,274 --> 01:41:44,426
Fine. Good decision.
Good decision.

1325
01:41:47,994 --> 01:41:51,384
The fame thing isn't really real,
you know ?

1326
01:41:55,034 --> 01:41:58,504
And don't forget l'm--

1327
01:41:58,594 --> 01:42:02,223
l'm also just a girl...

1328
01:42:02,314 --> 01:42:06,273
standing in front of a boy...

1329
01:42:06,354 --> 01:42:08,822
asking him to love her.

1330
01:42:19,274 --> 01:42:21,105
Goodbye.

1331
01:42:42,594 --> 01:42:44,903
So what do you think ?
Good move ?

1332
01:42:44,994 --> 01:42:47,189
Yeah, good move.

1333
01:42:47,274 --> 01:42:49,834
l mean, when all's said and done,
she's nothing special.

1334
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:51,745
l saw her taking her trousers down,

1335
01:42:51,834 --> 01:42:54,553
and l definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

1336
01:42:54,634 --> 01:42:57,353
Good decision, yeah.

1337
01:42:57,434 --> 01:42:59,743
All actresses are as mad as snakes.

1338
01:42:59,834 --> 01:43:02,746
- Tones, what do you reckon ?
- Never met her, never want to.

1339
01:43:02,834 --> 01:43:06,383
- Brilliant. Max ?
- Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.

1340
01:43:06,474 --> 01:43:09,113
Great. Thanks. Brilliant.

1341
01:43:10,354 --> 01:43:12,788
l was called and l came. What's up ?

1342
01:43:12,874 --> 01:43:14,944
William's just turned down Anna Scott.

1343
01:43:16,514 --> 01:43:19,267
You daft prick.

1344
01:43:19,354 --> 01:43:22,630
No, no.
No, no, it's actually quite sensible.

1345
01:43:25,834 --> 01:43:29,429
That painting
isn't the original, is it ?

1346
01:43:29,514 --> 01:43:31,982
Um, you know,
l think it might be, yeah.

1347
01:43:34,794 --> 01:43:37,024
But she said
she wanted to go out with you.

1348
01:43:39,474 --> 01:43:42,307
- Yeah.
- Well, that's nice.

1349
01:43:43,794 --> 01:43:46,752
What ?

1350
01:43:46,834 --> 01:43:48,904
Well, you know,

1351
01:43:48,994 --> 01:43:52,953
anyone saying they wanna go out with you
is pretty great, isn't it ?

1352
01:43:58,474 --> 01:44:01,068
lt was...

1353
01:44:01,154 --> 01:44:03,304
sort of... sweet, actually.

1354
01:44:03,394 --> 01:44:06,192
Um, l mean,
l know she's an actress and all that...

1355
01:44:06,274 --> 01:44:11,906
so she can... deliver a line, but, um,

1356
01:44:11,994 --> 01:44:14,383
she said she might be
as famous as she can be,

1357
01:44:14,474 --> 01:44:17,227
but also that she was...

1358
01:44:17,314 --> 01:44:20,465
just a girl...

1359
01:44:20,554 --> 01:44:24,752
standing in front of a boy...

1360
01:44:24,834 --> 01:44:27,189
asking him... to love her.

1361
01:44:41,674 --> 01:44:44,984
Oh, sod a dog. l've made
the wrong decision, haven't l ?

1362
01:44:46,954 --> 01:44:48,706
Yeah.

1363
01:44:48,794 --> 01:44:51,866
Max, how fast is your car ?

1364
01:44:55,154 --> 01:44:58,783
- Good luck !
- lf anyone gets in our way,
we have small nuclear devices.

1365
01:44:58,874 --> 01:45:00,626
- Where to ?
- All l can think is The Ritz.

1366
01:45:00,714 --> 01:45:03,182
- Where's Bella ?
- She's not coming.

1367
01:45:03,274 --> 01:45:06,346
- Oh, sod that. Bernie, in the back.
- What ?

1368
01:45:08,874 --> 01:45:11,183
Max, l'm okay.

1369
01:45:11,274 --> 01:45:13,265
Come on, babe.

1370
01:45:20,994 --> 01:45:23,189
Which way are you going ?

1371
01:45:23,274 --> 01:45:26,311
Down Kensington Church Street, then
Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.

1372
01:45:26,394 --> 01:45:28,954
- No, crazy. Go along Bayswater.
- That's right. Then Park Lane.

1373
01:45:29,034 --> 01:45:30,990
No, straight down to the Cromwell Road,
then left.

1374
01:45:34,314 --> 01:45:37,829
Stop right there !
l will decide the route. All right ?

1375
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:40,030
Sorry, Max.

1376
01:45:40,114 --> 01:45:42,912
James Bond never has to put up
with this sort of shit.

1377
01:45:49,714 --> 01:45:52,148
Turn right !

1378
01:45:52,234 --> 01:45:53,667
- l can't. lt's one way.
- Do a U-turn.

1379
01:45:53,754 --> 01:45:56,393
Oh, sod it. Hold on.

1380
01:46:02,034 --> 01:46:05,106
Brilliant !

1381
01:46:09,554 --> 01:46:12,830
Bloody hell, this is fun !

1382
01:46:12,914 --> 01:46:14,745
Sorry.

1383
01:46:14,834 --> 01:46:17,029
Hi.
ls Miss Scott staying here ?

1384
01:46:17,114 --> 01:46:20,345
- No, sir.
- How 'bout Miss Flintstone ?

1385
01:46:20,434 --> 01:46:23,346
- No, sir.
- Uh, Bambi ?

1386
01:46:23,434 --> 01:46:26,392
- No, sir.
- Or, um--

1387
01:46:26,474 --> 01:46:30,433
l don't know.
Beavis or Butthead ?

1388
01:46:30,514 --> 01:46:33,233
No, sir.

1389
01:46:33,314 --> 01:46:35,828
Thanks. Thanks.

1390
01:46:35,914 --> 01:46:38,428
There was a Miss Pocahontas,

1391
01:46:38,514 --> 01:46:41,028
but she checked out
about an hour ago.

1392
01:46:41,114 --> 01:46:43,708
l believe she's holding
a press conference at the Savoy...

1393
01:46:43,794 --> 01:46:46,752
before flying to America.

1394
01:46:50,874 --> 01:46:52,705
We have liftoff.

1395
01:47:01,474 --> 01:47:03,351
You have message for Takiama ?

1396
01:47:03,434 --> 01:47:05,504
l'll just check, sir.

1397
01:47:27,714 --> 01:47:29,989
Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.

1398
01:47:34,114 --> 01:47:37,663
Stop ! Stop ! Stop !
Stay there ! Go ! Go !

1399
01:47:37,754 --> 01:47:40,871
Whoa, whoa, whoa ! Hang on !

1400
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:43,832
Come on ! No ! Wait ! Wait there !

1401
01:47:43,914 --> 01:47:45,950
Come on ! Come on ! Wait !

1402
01:47:46,034 --> 01:47:49,071
Whoa, whoa, whoa ! Go on !
Through, through !

1403
01:47:50,634 --> 01:47:53,102
You're my hero !

1404
01:47:53,194 --> 01:47:55,025
Whoa ! Down, boy.

1405
01:48:13,954 --> 01:48:15,785
Excuse me.

1406
01:48:15,874 --> 01:48:18,388
- Yes ?
- Where's the press conference, please ?

1407
01:48:18,474 --> 01:48:21,511
- Are you an accredited
member of the press ?
- Yep.

1408
01:48:22,954 --> 01:48:27,232
- There you go.
- That's a Blockbuster Video
membership card, sir.

1409
01:48:27,314 --> 01:48:30,306
That's right.
l work for their in-house magazine.

1410
01:48:30,394 --> 01:48:32,544
- Movies Are Our Business.
- l'm sorry, sir.

1411
01:48:32,634 --> 01:48:35,023
- He's with me.
- And you are ?

1412
01:48:35,114 --> 01:48:39,266
Writing an article on how London hotels
treat people in wheelchairs.

1413
01:48:40,234 --> 01:48:43,226
Yes, of course, madam.
lt's in the Lancaster Room.

1414
01:48:43,314 --> 01:48:45,623
Though l'm afraid you're rather late.

1415
01:48:45,714 --> 01:48:47,591
Run !

1416
01:49:02,274 --> 01:49:05,903
Does this mean that Miss Scott
will not be publicizing her next film ?

1417
01:49:05,994 --> 01:49:08,144
No, it absolutely
does not mean that.

1418
01:49:08,234 --> 01:49:10,304
She'll be abiding by
all her present commitments.

1419
01:49:10,394 --> 01:49:14,103
She just won't be making
any more for the next year.

1420
01:49:14,194 --> 01:49:16,185
When will the film be released ?

1421
01:49:16,274 --> 01:49:18,469
At the moment,
the plan is to release in America...

1422
01:49:18,554 --> 01:49:20,385
towards the end of the autumn,

1423
01:49:20,474 --> 01:49:23,671
and over here around Christmas
or early in the new year.

1424
01:49:23,754 --> 01:49:25,745
Right ! Dominic.

1425
01:49:25,834 --> 01:49:28,826
Anna, how much longer are you
staying in the U.K., then ?

1426
01:49:28,914 --> 01:49:30,745
No time at all.
l leave tonight.

1427
01:49:30,834 --> 01:49:35,544
Which is why we have to round things
up now, so final questions, please.

1428
01:49:35,634 --> 01:49:37,272
Yes. Lady there.

1429
01:49:37,354 --> 01:49:40,073
ls your decision to take
a year off anything to do...

1430
01:49:40,154 --> 01:49:43,271
with the rumours about Jeff
and his present leading lady ?

1431
01:49:43,354 --> 01:49:46,630
- Absolutely not.
- Do you believe the rumours ?

1432
01:49:46,714 --> 01:49:50,389
Well, it's really
not my business any more.

1433
01:49:50,474 --> 01:49:55,104
Though l will say, from my experience,
rumours about Jeff do tend to be true.

1434
01:49:57,674 --> 01:50:01,508
Yeah. The last time you were here, there
were some fairly graphic photographs...

1435
01:50:01,594 --> 01:50:05,428
taken of you
with a young English guy.

1436
01:50:05,514 --> 01:50:08,506
So, uh, what happened there ?

1437
01:50:08,594 --> 01:50:11,825
He was just a friend.
We're still friends, l think.

1438
01:50:11,914 --> 01:50:15,031
Right, um--

1439
01:50:15,114 --> 01:50:17,389
Yes. Gentleman in the pink shirt.

1440
01:50:22,834 --> 01:50:27,191
Yes. Miss Scott,

1441
01:50:27,274 --> 01:50:29,583
are there any circumstances in which...

1442
01:50:29,674 --> 01:50:32,472
the two of you...

1443
01:50:32,554 --> 01:50:35,591
might be more than just good friends ?

1444
01:50:37,274 --> 01:50:41,825
l hoped there would be, but no,
l'm... assured there aren't.

1445
01:50:41,914 --> 01:50:45,304
- But what would you say if--
- Sorry. Just the one question, please.

1446
01:50:45,394 --> 01:50:47,908
No, it's all right.
You were saying ?

1447
01:50:49,554 --> 01:50:52,466
l was just wondering if, uh,

1448
01:50:52,554 --> 01:50:56,149
it turned out that this person, uh--

1449
01:50:56,234 --> 01:50:58,111
Thacker. His name was Thacker.

1450
01:50:58,194 --> 01:51:00,230
Thanks, thanks.

1451
01:51:00,314 --> 01:51:02,874
l just wondered whether if...

1452
01:51:02,954 --> 01:51:06,742
Mr Thacker realized he'd been
a daft prick...

1453
01:51:09,074 --> 01:51:12,350
and got down on his knees and...
begged you to reconsider,

1454
01:51:12,434 --> 01:51:16,029
whether you would, in fact, then...

1455
01:51:16,114 --> 01:51:18,105
reconsider ?

1456
01:51:27,234 --> 01:51:30,271
Yes, l believe l would.

1457
01:51:32,394 --> 01:51:35,352
That's very good news.
Um--

1458
01:51:36,714 --> 01:51:40,024
The readers of Horse & Hound
will be absolutely delighted.

1459
01:51:46,634 --> 01:51:49,944
Right. Uh, Dominic, if you'd
like to ask your question again ?

1460
01:51:50,034 --> 01:51:55,233
Yeah ? Anna, how long are you
intending to stay here in Britain ?

1461
01:52:01,954 --> 01:52:03,433
lndefinitely.

1462
01:52:27,274 --> 01:52:30,072
- What happened ?
- lt was good.
