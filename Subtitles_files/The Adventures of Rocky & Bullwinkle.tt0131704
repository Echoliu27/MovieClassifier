1964, a crucial moment[br]in American history..

Lyndon Johnson is re-elected to[br]the presidency by a landslide,.

the New York World's Fair[br]introduces a bright new future,.

00:00:56.55,00:00:58.95
and after five scintillating[br]years on the air...

00:00:59.06,00:01:00.55
Presto!

00:01:00.66,00:01:03.12
The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show[br]is abruptly cancelled.

00:01:03.23,00:01:04.35
- Cancelled?![br]- Cancelled?!

00:01:05.56,00:01:08.12
Uh, sorry about that, boys.

The Cold War is over.

00:01:15.51,00:01:18.24
And The Rocky and[br]Bullwinkle Show...

00:01:18.34,00:01:20.37
is still cancelled.

00:01:25.15,00:01:27.14
Frostbite Falls, Minnesota,

00:01:27.25,00:01:29.05
once the beloved home[br]of Rocky and Bullwinkle,

00:01:29.15,00:01:30.88
had been a thriving[br]cartoon town.

00:01:30.99,00:01:34.65
Nowit was crippled[br]by years of reruns.

00:01:34.76,00:01:37.39
The beautiful[br]Frostbite Falls Forest--

00:01:37.49,00:01:39.05
decimated.

00:01:42.00,00:01:44.09
The once majestic falls[br]above Veronica Lake...

00:01:44.20,00:01:47.07
( Whistle Blowing )[br]...devastated.

00:01:47.17,00:01:49.50
While the narrator--[br]that's me--

00:01:49.64,00:01:51.23
down on his luck[br]and out of a job,

00:01:51.34,00:01:52.67
was forced to move in[br]with his mother

00:01:52.81,00:01:54.24
where he was reduced[br]to narrating

00:01:54.34,00:01:55.87
the events[br]of his own life.

00:01:55.98,00:01:57.34
"With the speed and dexterity

00:01:57.45,00:01:59.04
astonishing in a woman[br]of her advancing years,

00:01:59.15,00:02:01.08
Mother bastes the chicken,[br]tosses the salad,

00:02:01.18,00:02:02.28
and mashes the potatoes."

( Metal Clank)[br]Ow!

00:02:06.06,00:02:08.62
And in a little house[br]at the top of a stump forest,

00:02:08.72,00:02:10.42
Rocky and Bullwinkle[br]themselves,

00:02:10.53,00:02:12.59
were forced to subsist[br]on ever-diminishing[br]residual checks

00:02:12.70,00:02:14.53
from reruns of their oldshow.

00:02:14.63,00:02:16.60
World famous television stars

00:02:16.70,00:02:19.07
whose adventures once[br]took them all over the globe,

00:02:19.17,00:02:21.60
now their exploits[br]were just a memory.

00:02:23.04,00:02:26.10
Yes, it was a[br]melancholy time indeed.

00:02:26.21,00:02:27.80
( Record Skipping )

00:02:29.38,00:02:32.07
Rocky the flying squirrel[br]hadn't flown in years.

00:02:32.18,00:02:33.77
What's the point?

00:02:33.88,00:02:37.61
I guess the world just doesn't[br]need us anymore, Bullwinkle.

00:02:37.72,00:02:39.95
Say, where are[br]you going?

00:02:40.06,00:02:42.12
All this exposition[br]is wearing me out.

00:02:42.23,00:02:44.28
I'm going for a walk[br]in the woods.

00:02:44.39,00:02:46.88
But, Bullwinkle,[br]there aren't any[br]woods anymore.

00:02:47.03,00:02:49.00
You don't have[br]to tell me.

00:02:49.10,00:02:52.30
I'm the chairman of[br]the Frostbite Falls Society[br]for Wildlife Conversation.

00:02:52.40,00:02:54.39
You mean[br]wildlife conservation.

00:02:54.50,00:02:55.56
What did I say?

00:02:55.67,00:02:57.94
You said,[br]"wildlife conversation."

00:02:58.04,00:03:00.60
Somebody's going to start[br]talking about these things.

00:03:00.71,00:03:05.01
Yes, even their wordplay[br]had become hackneyed and cheap.

00:03:05.11,00:03:07.11
No, it was always[br]like this.

00:03:07.22,00:03:10.08
But times were just as tough[br]half way across the drawing

00:03:10.19,00:03:12.48
in the former Soviet satellite[br]of Pottsylvania.

00:03:12.59,00:03:14.45
Where Rocky and Bullwinkle's[br]archrivals,

00:03:14.56,00:03:15.49
Boris and Natasha,

00:03:15.59,00:03:16.75
and their fearless leader--

00:03:16.86,00:03:17.95
Fearless Leader--

00:03:18.06,00:03:19.53
were cooking up[br]their latest scheme

00:03:19.63,00:03:20.99
for taking over the world,

00:03:21.10,00:03:22.33
when their plans[br]were crushed

00:03:22.43,00:03:24.19
by the fall[br]of the lron Curtain.

00:03:25.74,00:03:27.00
What's going on?

00:03:27.10,00:03:28.26
But, while the citizens[br]of Pottsylvania

00:03:28.37,00:03:30.50
rejoiced in their[br]new found freedom...

00:03:30.61,00:03:32.04
Yay!

00:03:32.14,00:03:34.30
...Fearless Leaderand[br]his cohorts went underground,

00:03:34.41,00:03:37.17
where upon they embarked[br]upona terrifying plan,

00:03:37.28,00:03:40.08
a plan that would take them[br]to a strange new land

00:03:40.22,00:03:43.38
where the line between cartoon[br]and reality is so thin,

00:03:43.49,00:03:45.65
that's it's hard to tell[br]one from the other.

00:03:45.76,00:03:47.48
A place where with[br]the right special effects,

00:03:47.59,00:03:49.56
it might just be possible[br]to break through...

00:03:49.66,00:03:51.15
to the otherside!

00:03:51.26,00:03:54.53
( " Hooray For Hollywood" Plays )

00:03:56.80,00:04:00.57
It was a beautiful and smoggy[br]day at Phony Pictures Studio,

00:04:00.67,00:04:03.54
where an ambitious junior[br]executive named Minnie Mogul

00:04:03.64,00:04:06.51
was busy searching[br]for a hot new script.

00:04:06.61,00:04:08.20
Too intelligent.

00:04:09.65,00:04:11.24
( Shredding )

00:04:11.35,00:04:12.84
Too intelligent.

00:04:12.95,00:04:15.14
Hello, Minnie.

00:04:15.25,00:04:16.88
Holy mackerel![br]Who areyou?

00:04:16.99,00:04:19.05
Three ofthe most[br]terrifying villains

00:04:19.16,00:04:21.42
in the history of[br]children's television.

00:04:21.52,00:04:22.51
How do you do?

00:04:22.63,00:04:23.89
Nice to meetyou.

00:04:23.99,00:04:25.15
What do you want?

00:04:25.26,00:04:27.56
We were wondering,[br]how would you like

00:04:27.66,00:04:30.06
toproduce the Rocky[br]andBullwinkle movie?

00:04:30.17,00:04:33.07
I'd love to.[br]I love it.

00:04:33.17,00:04:34.50
What is it?

00:04:34.60,00:04:37.90
It's classic American cartoon[br]from early '60s.

00:04:38.01,00:04:38.94
Mm-hmm.

00:04:39.04,00:04:40.51
Listen, Minnie...

00:04:40.61,00:04:43.34
we're stuck in reruns.[br]You're looking for a project.

00:04:43.45,00:04:44.88
Maybe we can help[br]each other out.

00:04:44.98,00:04:47.21
This contractgives[br]youallrights

00:04:47.32,00:04:49.44
to The Rockyand[br]Bullwinkle Show.

00:04:49.55,00:04:51.21
All you have to do[br]is sign right here

00:04:51.32,00:04:56.35
andyour fiirst[br]producing endeavor[br]is as goodas gold.

00:04:56.46,00:04:57.79
What's the matter?

00:04:57.89,00:04:59.52
I can't sign a contract

00:04:59.63,00:05:02.22
that will help three ruthless[br]villains take over the world.

00:05:02.33,00:05:03.09
I just can't.

00:05:03.20,00:05:04.69
Why not!?

00:05:04.80,00:05:06.27
My pen's out ofink.

00:05:06.37,00:05:08.10
Use mine.

00:05:08.20,00:05:09.60
Okay.

00:05:09.71,00:05:11.37
And then through the miracle[br]of computer-generated

00:05:11.47,00:05:12.60
digital technology...

00:05:12.71,00:05:14.14
Minnie reached[br]into the televisionset

00:05:14.24,00:05:15.87
and signedthe contract.

00:05:15.98,00:05:19.11
But when she tried[br]to pull the contractout...

00:05:19.22,00:05:21.41
the expensive animated[br]characters

00:05:21.52,00:05:23.61
were instantly converted[br]into evenmore expensive

00:05:23.72,00:05:26.12
motionpicture stars.

00:05:26.22,00:05:27.95
( Screaming )

00:05:28.06,00:05:30.03
( Crashing )

00:05:41.00,00:05:42.63
Hey...

00:05:42.74,00:05:44.33
how did that happen?

00:05:44.44,00:05:46.14
We're attached[br]to the project.

00:05:48.24,00:05:49.80
But even though thepun[br]was weak,

00:05:49.91,00:05:52.11
the contract was ironclad.

00:05:52.21,00:05:54.31
And the three villains[br]walked out of the studio

00:05:54.42,00:05:56.15
and into the real world,

00:05:56.25,00:05:57.69
while Minnie marched[br]straight into the offiice

00:05:57.79,00:06:00.59
of Phony Pictures' C.E.O.,[br]P. G. Biggershot.

00:06:01.96,00:06:03.48
But unfortunately for her,

00:06:03.59,00:06:05.46
when she pitched her project[br]to the powerful executive,

00:06:05.56,00:06:07.93
she ran into[br]an unexpected snag.

00:06:08.03,00:06:10.66
I don't like[br]moose pictures.

00:06:10.77,00:06:13.53
So while Minnie's motion[br]picture plans were stymied,

00:06:13.64,00:06:15.16
back in Frostbite Falls,

00:06:15.27,00:06:17.47
Bullwinkle got a rare flash[br]of inspiration.

00:06:17.57,00:06:19.17
It is kinda hot in here.

00:06:19.28,00:06:21.37
I've been inspiring[br]for hours.

00:06:21.48,00:06:23.88
- Hey, where areyou going?[br]- I'm going to the White House,

00:06:23.98,00:06:26.68
to talk to the president[br]about the trees.

00:06:26.78,00:06:29.48
So Rocky and Bullwinkle set off[br]on the road to Washington.

00:06:29.59,00:06:32.45
I don't know, Bullwinkle,[br]it looks a little jammed.

00:06:32.56,00:06:34.58
Horsefeathers![br]How bad could it be?

00:06:38.73,00:06:40.63
Rocky:[br]Look at all the red tape!

00:06:40.73,00:06:41.99
Don't worry,[br]little buddy.

00:06:42.10,00:06:43.46
I'm sure the president[br]will send for us

00:06:43.57,00:06:45.53
after all the letters[br]I wrote him.

00:06:45.63,00:06:47.50
Why, I bet[br]any second now...

00:06:47.60,00:06:51.31
or two...[br]or three... or four...

00:06:51.31,00:06:51.64
or two...[br]or three... or four...

00:06:51.74,00:06:55.07
There the matter seemed[br]destined to rest...

00:06:55.18,00:06:58.01
until six months later,[br]in Washington, D. C.,

00:06:58.11,00:06:59.64
when idealistic,[br]warm hearted,

00:06:59.75,00:07:02.41
and beautiful FBl agent,[br]Karen Sympathy,

00:07:02.52,00:07:04.82
was summoned to the office[br]of hard-boiled FBl director,

00:07:04.92,00:07:06.72
"Cappy" Von Trappment.

00:07:06.82,00:07:08.38
Agent Sympathy,

00:07:08.49,00:07:10.32
given all your bungled[br]assignments in the past,

00:07:10.43,00:07:11.52
I suppose[br]you were wondering

00:07:11.63,00:07:12.99
why I picked you[br]for this mission.

00:07:13.10,00:07:14.43
Yes, sir.

00:07:14.53,00:07:16.50
Sympathy,[br]allow me to be frank.

00:07:16.60,00:07:19.23
Thisjob requires[br]the ideal FBI agent--

00:07:20.34,00:07:21.70
someone tough,

00:07:21.80,00:07:22.93
someone[br]hard-bitten,

00:07:23.04,00:07:24.27
someone[br]emotionless.

00:07:24.37,00:07:25.60
Do you understand?

00:07:25.71,00:07:28.07
Yes, sir. Tough![br]Hard-boiled! Unemotional!

00:07:28.18,00:07:30.67
Good.

00:07:30.78,00:07:33.58
Are you familiar with[br]The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show?

00:07:33.68,00:07:34.67
Oh-hh!

00:07:37.85,00:07:39.75
I mean... ahem...

00:07:39.86,00:07:41.76
I've heard of it.

00:07:41.86,00:07:44.59
17 1/2 short minutes later...

00:07:44.69,00:07:45.92
Cappy:[br]Mr. President,

00:07:46.03,00:07:48.16
this is a regular[br]networkTV station.

00:07:49.87,00:07:51.09

standing firm lyin[br]the middle of the road.

00:07:53.97,00:07:56.30
But lookwhat happens[br]when we switch to cable...

00:07:57.21,00:07:58.20
( Static )

00:08:03.01,00:08:04.88
For the last six months,

00:08:04.98,00:08:07.28
a cartoon villain from the old[br]Rocky and Bullwinkle Show

00:08:07.38,00:08:09.04
named Fearless Leader[br]has been buying up

00:08:09.19,00:08:12.59
every single hour of cable[br]programming in this country,

00:08:12.69,00:08:14.78
forming asingle[br]gigantic network

00:08:14.89,00:08:17.15
called RBTV,

00:08:17.26,00:08:20.39
or " Really Bad Television."

00:08:20.50,00:08:22.79
According to our sources,[br]three days from now

00:08:22.90,00:08:25.73
Fearless Leader plans[br]to broadcast TV shows[br]so terrible,

00:08:25.84,00:08:27.50
they'll turn anyone[br]who watches them

00:08:27.60,00:08:29.33
into a mindless zombie,

00:08:29.44,00:08:31.24
incapable of independent[br]thought.

00:08:31.34,00:08:34.28
Totally different[br]than regular TV.

00:08:34.38,00:08:37.81
The RBTV broadcast[br]starts at noon on Saturday.

00:08:37.91,00:08:39.40
By 8:00 that night,

00:08:39.52,00:08:41.85
Fearless Leaderwill have[br]hypnotized enough viewers

00:08:41.95,00:08:43.44
that he can go on the air

00:08:43.55,00:08:45.82
and make the whole country[br]vote for him as president.

00:08:47.86,00:08:49.15
Well...

00:08:49.26,00:08:50.49
that's no good...

00:08:50.59,00:08:51.75
No.

00:08:51.86,00:08:53.49
No, I mean--

00:08:53.60,00:08:55.26
I want to be president again.

00:08:55.36,00:08:56.33
Yes.

00:08:58.30,00:08:59.60
We all know that, sir.

00:08:59.70,00:09:01.50
Can't the Pentagon[br]do something about this?

00:09:01.60,00:09:02.94

00:09:07.48,00:09:09.00
( Mumbling )[br]We can't think ofanything,[br]Mr. President.

Can't the FBI[br]do anything, Cappy?

00:09:12.82,00:09:16.08

Mr. President,

00:09:35.07,00:09:37.37
our only chance is to call on[br]those two gallant heroes...

00:09:37.47,00:09:40.70
who successfully foiled[br]Fearless Leader's schemes[br]forworld conquest...

00:09:40.81,00:09:42.90
backwhen he posed[br]a threat in the 1960s.

00:09:43.01,00:09:44.84
If anyone can stop him,[br]they can.

00:09:44.95,00:09:46.47

00:09:58.69,00:10:00.25
to get Rocky and Bullwinkle[br]to New York

00:10:00.36,00:10:02.49
and shut down[br]Fearless Leader's[br]broadcast.

00:10:02.60,00:10:04.09
Thank you, sir.[br]I won't fail.

00:10:04.20,00:10:05.50
just be careful.

00:10:05.60,00:10:07.26
We've already lost three[br]ofour best agents.

00:10:07.37,00:10:08.93
So good luck.

00:10:09.04,00:10:10.87
Oh, sir,[br]just one thing--

00:10:10.97,00:10:13.60
How do I get Rocky and[br]Bullwinkle out ofreruns?

00:10:13.71,00:10:15.77
I don't know.

00:10:15.88,00:10:17.21
Fearless Leader[br]and those other two

00:10:17.31,00:10:18.34
got out somehow,[br]didn't they?

00:10:19.85,00:10:20.97
Figure it out!

00:10:25.02,00:10:26.78

Didyou watch ourshow?

00:15:52.35,00:15:55.41

- You did?[br]- Sure!

00:15:57.39,00:15:59.51
Ever since I was a kid[br]I wanted to have adventures[br]like you guys.

escaped from the cartoon world[br]into the real world.

00:16:34.86,00:16:37.05
- So the president sent me to...[br]- Ofcourse!

00:16:37.16,00:16:39.15
The president got my letters[br]about the trees!

00:16:39.26,00:16:40.73
What trees?

00:16:40.83,00:16:43.66

00:16:43.77,00:16:45.63
- Look, we don't have time...[br]- Bullwinkle,

00:16:45.73,00:16:47.96
this lady isn't here[br]about the trees.

00:16:48.07,00:16:50.73
- She's from the FBl.[br]- FBl?

00:16:50.84,00:16:52.64
Didn't they take[br]our show off the air?

00:16:52.74,00:16:55.68
- You mean the FCC.[br]- Didn't they like it either?

00:16:55.78,00:16:57.27

00:16:57.38,00:16:59.01

Would you listen[br]to me, please?

this is the quality control.

Andso, racked with[br]internal conflicts,

00:27:56.24,00:27:58.40
they made their way[br]across the Great Divide

Butsince they were[br]in themiddle ofthe desert,

00:28:15.89,00:28:17.95
there was obviously[br]no chance whatsoever

00:29:42.88,00:29:44.78
I can't mess up[br]this time.

00:29:44.88,00:29:47.61
"This time"?[br]Was there a last time?

00:29:47.72,00:29:49.74
Tell us about[br]yourself, Karen.

00:29:50.99,00:29:53.39
Let'sjust say[br]I've made...

00:29:53.49,00:29:54.58
mistakes.

00:29:57.63,00:29:59.29
Look, I can't blow this one.

00:29:59.39,00:30:01.22
The whole world depends on it,

00:30:01.33,00:30:04.03
and I can't do it[br]withoutyour help.

00:30:05.80,00:30:07.20
Agent Sympathy,

00:30:07.30,00:30:09.43
you can count on[br]Bullwinkle and me.

00:30:09.54,00:30:12.20
- We won't letyou down.[br]- No.

00:30:12.31,00:30:14.10
Thanks, you guys.

00:30:14.21,00:30:15.70
You know,

00:30:15.81,00:30:18.30
I'm glad Cappy picked me[br]for this mission.

00:30:18.41,00:30:20.57
I think we're gonna make[br]a great team.

00:30:20.68,00:30:22.67
( Police Siren )

00:30:22.82,00:30:24.38
- Huh?[br]- Oh, no.

00:30:24.49,00:30:26.11
And just as[br]this sentimental moment

00:30:26.22,00:30:27.95
had mercifully[br]come to a close,

00:30:28.06,00:30:30.46
our heroes were pulled over[br]by two state troopers

00:30:30.56,00:30:31.56
and a cameraman[br]from the hit TV show,

Step out of the vehicle[br]with your hands up, please!

00:30:40.90,00:30:43.13
It's okay, Officers,[br]I'm with the FBl--

00:30:43.24,00:30:44.97
Step out of the vehicle now!

00:30:45.07,00:30:46.80
Hey, Rock,[br]your face is all blurry.

00:30:46.91,00:30:48.14
So's yours.

00:30:48.24,00:30:49.80
This truck matches[br]the description...

00:30:49.91,00:30:52.35
ofa vehicle reported stolen[br]outside Red Bait, Oklahoma,

00:30:52.45,00:30:54.24
just a couple ofhours ago.

00:30:54.35,00:30:57.08
You are under arrest[br]for grand theft auto

00:30:57.19,00:31:00.31
and for impersonating[br]FBI agent, Karen Sympathy.

00:31:00.42,00:31:02.95
I am FBI Agent[br]Karen Sympathy!

00:31:03.06,00:31:04.32
Like fun you are.

00:31:04.43,00:31:05.82
We both know Agent[br]Karen Sympathy...

has a heavy[br]Pottsylvanian accent.

00:31:07.93,00:31:09.02
We heard her on the radio.

00:31:09.13,00:31:11.10
But she really is[br]with the FBl!

00:31:11.20,00:31:12.63
Yeah, and I'm really[br]john Goodman.

00:31:12.73,00:31:13.93
Let's get in the car.

00:31:14.04,00:31:15.30
just one minute, Officer!

00:31:15.40,00:31:17.50
Wherever she goes,[br]we go.

00:31:17.61,00:31:19.84
Yeah, that's right.[br]We're a team!

00:31:19.94,00:31:22.31
Well, she's going off[br]to the federal pen...

00:31:22.41,00:31:24.94
to break rocks for[br]the next fiiveyears.

00:31:25.05,00:31:28.68
Okay, well,[br]don't forget to write.

00:31:28.78,00:31:30.38
I guess we could always[br]appear atyour trial...

00:31:30.48,00:31:32.51
as animated character[br]witnesses!

00:31:32.62,00:31:34.68
No![br]Rocky, Bullwinkle...

00:31:34.79,00:31:37.52
it's your duty to get[br]to New York by 8:00 PM tomorrow.

00:31:37.63,00:31:39.79
Rocky:[br]Karen, we can't[br]leaveyounow.

00:31:39.89,00:31:42.62
Hey, I'm an FBI agent,[br]remember?

00:31:42.73,00:31:45.22
I'll straighten this out,[br]and catch up with you later.

00:31:45.33,00:31:48.39
But we've never been[br]in the real world before!

00:31:48.50,00:31:50.77
Oh, you'll do great.[br]I know it.

00:31:52.74,00:31:55.21
Hey![br]What about our faces?

00:31:55.31,00:31:56.80
Oh--[br]sorry.

00:32:11.16,00:32:13.89
Wait, you can't just leave them[br]on the side ofthe road[br]like that.

00:32:14.00,00:32:16.59
They don't even know[br]where they are.

00:32:16.70,00:32:19.43
Don't worry, ma'am.[br]They're animals.

00:32:19.53,00:32:20.90
They'll forage.

00:32:27.64,00:32:29.23
Bullwinkle:[br]C'mon, Rock,[br]time's a-wastin'!

00:32:29.34,00:32:31.71
We owe it to Karen[br]to see the president[br]about the trees!

00:32:31.81,00:32:33.01
Trees?

00:32:33.11,00:32:35.21
Bullwinkle, we have[br]to go to New York.

00:32:35.32,00:32:37.72
We don't have time[br]to get to Washington!

00:32:37.82,00:32:40.41
This is no time to worry[br]about getting the washing done.

00:32:40.52,00:32:43.62
Not "washing done."[br]Washing-ton!

00:32:43.72,00:32:44.78
A ton?!

00:32:44.89,00:32:46.05
Well, that is[br]a lot oflaundry.

00:32:46.16,00:32:48.59
Bullwinkle, that joke[br]just won't wash!

00:32:48.70,00:32:50.46
Well, you can't[br]blame me for drying!

00:32:50.56,00:32:51.59
( Chuckles )

00:32:51.70,00:32:53.46
I think I'll fly ahead.

00:32:55.80,00:32:58.10
Butit was just no use.

00:32:58.21,00:33:00.30
Faced with[br]the utter hopelessness[br]of their predicament,

00:33:00.41,00:33:02.31
the razor-sharp mind[br]of Bullwinkle

00:33:02.41,00:33:04.57
quickly formulated[br]a daring plan.

00:33:04.68,00:33:06.15
Help! Help!

00:33:06.25,00:33:08.04
Somebody please help!

00:33:08.15,00:33:10.48
Help!

00:33:10.58,00:33:12.88
So on they walked,[br]two lone figures...

00:33:12.99,00:33:15.42
making their way[br]through a foreign and hostile[br]live-action landscape.

00:33:15.52,00:33:16.72

I thought you said[br]we were in Oklahoma.

00:33:18.56,00:33:19.79
Would you like to[br]narrate this movie?

00:33:19.89,00:33:21.12
No.

00:33:21.23,00:33:23.13
And so on they walked,[br]two lone figures...

00:33:23.23,00:33:25.96
making their way[br]through a foreign and hostile[br]live-action landscape.

00:33:26.07,00:33:27.63
They walked until[br]their thumbs ached,

00:33:27.74,00:33:28.96
but no one wanted[br]to take a chance...

00:33:29.07,00:33:30.77
ona 6'7"[br]talking moose

00:33:30.87,00:33:32.93
and a flying squirrel[br]who couldn't fly.

00:33:33.04,00:33:35.84
I could f-fly if l had to!

( Truck Horn Blares )

00:33:40.61,00:33:42.08
Whoa!

00:33:43.92,00:33:45.01
Ow!

00:33:46.39,00:33:48.32
Kinda makes you[br]feel discouraged.

00:33:48.42,00:33:50.48
Maybe we should be a little[br]more aggressive.

00:33:51.43,00:33:52.98
( Horn Blares )

00:33:55.23,00:33:55.89
Stop!

00:33:58.80,00:34:00.13
This movie's gettin'[br]kind of...

00:34:00.23,00:34:01.13
Don't say it!

00:34:02.74,00:34:04.86
Yes, things were beginning[br]to look mighty dark...

00:34:04.97,00:34:07.00
for our intrepid heroes...

00:34:07.11,00:34:08.67
It is gettin'[br]kinda hard to see.

00:34:08.78,00:34:11.64
Bullwinkle, he means[br]our situation.

00:34:11.75,00:34:13.27
Oh!

00:34:13.38,00:34:15.51
Wait a minute, boys,[br]there's a couple of headlights.

00:34:15.62,00:34:16.95

Bullwinkle:[br]Gee, fellas, perhaps[br]you've been looking too hard.

00:35:03.66,00:35:05.43

in a thousand different[br]beautiful manifestations.

00:35:08.60,00:35:11.40
Wouldn't you say so,[br]young people?

00:35:11.51,00:35:13.23
Yeah, right.

Flying ahead[br]to Wossamotta U....

00:35:41.67,00:35:43.86
the two villains made[br]asizable donation[br]to the college...

00:35:44.00,00:35:46.20
in Bullwinkle's name...

00:35:46.31,00:35:49.04
prompting the college president[br]to bestow upon Bullwinkle...

00:35:49.18,00:35:50.94
an honorary moosters degree.

00:35:53.05,00:35:56.14

There was only one problem...

Wossamotta U. had[br]no watertower.

00:36:07.03,00:36:10.43
Can't even find[br]water fountain.

00:36:10.53,00:36:13.02
Their entire scheme seemed[br]to be on the verge ofcollapse,

00:36:13.17,00:36:15.97
until they hit upon an[br]incredibly ingenious plan...

00:36:16.07,00:36:16.97
Together:[br]What?!

had finally arrived.

under the watchful eyes[br]ofa tall, blond,

00:36:41.23,00:36:44.53

Well, Wossamotta U.'s been[br]a live-action university

00:38:02.38,00:38:05.40
since the show went[br]into reruns back in '64.

00:38:05.51,00:38:08.61
I thought the buildings[br]looked a lot more realistic.

00:38:08.72,00:38:10.58
Say, whereyou guys been[br]all this time, huh?

00:38:10.68,00:38:12.35
Reruns.

00:38:12.45,00:38:14.42
You know that's never gonna[br]happen to us, right?

00:38:15.79,00:38:17.28
Well, anyway,[br]there's still a lot...

00:38:17.39,00:38:20.29
ofanti-cartoon feeling[br]on campus these days.

00:38:20.39,00:38:21.92
Hokey smoke,[br]Bullwinkle!

00:38:22.03,00:38:24.09
It's some kind[br]of demonstration.

00:38:24.20,00:38:26.86
What are the kids[br]protesting these days?

00:38:26.97,00:38:28.73
Is it a civil rights march?

00:38:28.84,00:38:30.57
Not really...

00:38:30.67,00:38:32.54
Is it an anti-war rally?

00:38:32.64,00:38:34.97
No, not exactly.

00:38:35.08,00:38:36.20
Tell 'em, fellas.

00:38:37.88,00:38:40.81
It's a anti-moose march.

00:38:40.91,00:38:42.40
Yes, itseems that[br]araging controversy

00:38:42.52,00:38:44.61
had broken out among[br]the students that very morning

00:38:44.72,00:38:47.48
over the decision to give[br]Bullwinkle an honorary degree--

00:38:47.59,00:38:49.89
Gee, Bullwinkle,[br]I guess it's true.

00:38:49.99,00:38:51.96
You can't[br]go home again.

00:38:52.06,00:38:53.99
Why, Rocky![br]Whatever doyou mean?

00:38:54.09,00:38:56.29
Wossamotta U. is home!

00:38:56.40,00:38:57.56
Rocky:[br]Oh, brother!

00:38:57.67,00:39:00.90
Look! There's[br]the animated freak now!

00:39:01.04,00:39:02.47
( Booing )

00:39:05.57,00:39:06.80
My fans!

00:39:06.91,00:39:09.14
Bullwinkle,[br]these aren't fans.

00:39:09.24,00:39:11.14
This is an angry mob.

00:39:11.25,00:39:13.48
Butin the face of danger,[br]our insipid hero...

00:39:13.58,00:39:15.98
bravely made his way[br]through the angry crowd.

00:39:16.08,00:39:18.68
You mean "intrepid hero,"[br]don'tyou?

00:39:18.79,00:39:19.75
No-oo...

00:39:21.89,00:39:24.12
Hundreds of miles away,[br]in RedBait, Oklahoma,

00:39:24.22,00:39:28.52
it was time for[br]the prisoners' daily helping[br]of disgusting slop.

00:39:28.63,00:39:31.33
ButKarenSympathy[br]hadsucceededin making Ole,

00:39:31.43,00:39:34.33
the simple-minded[br]but incredibly handsome[br]prison guard,

00:39:34.44,00:39:36.10
fall madly in love[br]with her.

00:39:38.21,00:39:40.80
Presently, Karen promisedto[br]let him take her to the movies

00:39:40.91,00:39:43.50
ifhe would help her[br]break out of jail.

00:39:43.61,00:39:46.10
Could we hold hands[br]in the movie theatre?

00:39:46.21,00:39:48.27
Of course we could, Ole.

00:39:52.92,00:39:55.79
But how would we[br]eat our popcorn?

00:39:55.89,00:39:59.35
Well, we could eat[br]our popcorn with one hand...

00:39:59.46,00:40:01.93
and hold hands[br]with the other.

00:40:03.80,00:40:05.59
But what ifl want a soda?

00:40:05.73,00:40:06.72
Look--

00:40:09.50,00:40:11.40
I'm sure we can[br]work this out.

00:40:32.59,00:40:33.56
( Booing )

00:40:33.66,00:40:35.09
Good morning, students.

00:40:35.20,00:40:37.89
Today Wossamotta U.[br]honors one of our own...

00:40:38.00,00:40:40.09
( Mild Applause )

00:40:40.20,00:40:43.40
As the students vented[br]their collective spleen[br]at Bullwinkle,

00:40:43.50,00:40:46.23
RocketJ. Squirrel anxiously[br]surveyed the raging crowd

00:40:46.34,00:40:47.83
for signs of danger.

00:40:47.94,00:40:49.53
And suddenly,[br]his sharp little eyes

00:40:49.64,00:40:51.91
picked out the terrifying[br]figure of Boris Badenov

00:40:52.01,00:40:55.35
near the top[br]of the watertower.

00:40:55.45,00:40:58.42
Hey! That guy's not[br]a college student!

00:40:58.52,00:41:00.21
...that we present[br]this honorary degree...

00:41:00.32,00:41:03.08
to Bullwinkle J. Moose.

00:41:06.89,00:41:09.12
Good morning, children!

00:41:09.23,00:41:11.13
Today's lecture[br]is about trees.

00:41:12.63,00:41:15.10
Bullwinkle, look out![br]It's a trap!

00:41:15.20,00:41:16.50
ButRocky's voice[br]couldn'tcarry

00:41:16.64,00:41:18.61
overthestridentshouts[br]ofthestudentbody.

00:41:18.71,00:41:21.20
With no alternative in sight,[br]Rocky tried one more time

00:41:21.31,00:41:23.78
to summon up those faded[br]aeronautical skills

00:41:23.88,00:41:26.47
that had once made him[br]a household name.

00:41:26.58,00:41:29.57
But just then, Boris managed[br]to turn on the C.D.I.

00:41:29.68,00:41:30.98
Aha!

00:41:31.08,00:41:34.14
Yes, it looked like[br]curtains for Bullwinkle...

00:41:34.25,00:41:35.38
Got to--

00:41:35.49,00:41:37.75
save--

00:41:37.86,00:41:39.55
Bullwinkle!

00:41:46.10,00:41:46.96
Rocky:[br]Whoa!

00:41:50.67,00:41:52.10
" Bad command or fii le name.

00:41:52.21,00:41:54.27
Press any key to continue."

00:41:54.37,00:41:56.64
Which one is "any" key?

00:42:00.21,00:42:01.48
Rocky:[br]Look out!

00:42:07.02,00:42:08.99
Oh, no!

00:42:09.09,00:42:11.08
With asingle blow,[br]Rockysent the C.D.I.

00:42:11.19,00:42:12.75
hurtling through thesky...

00:42:17.76,00:42:19.32
where upon Boris[br]single-mindedly

00:42:19.43,00:42:21.53
reached out to catch[br]the catapulted computer,

00:42:21.64,00:42:23.47
forgetting as he did,

00:42:23.57,00:42:25.27
one vitally important[br]piece of information...

00:42:25.37,00:42:27.84
I ain't a cartoon no more.

00:42:27.94,00:42:29.00
Aahh!

00:42:35.92,00:42:37.01
Darling!

00:42:41.09,00:42:41.68
Ow!

00:42:46.66,00:42:48.03
Rocky:[br]Mayday!

00:42:53.33,00:42:55.13
( Cheering )

00:42:58.07,00:42:59.20
You like me!

00:42:59.31,00:43:01.80
You really like me!

00:43:01.94,00:43:04.21
I guess I've[br]lost the knack.

00:43:04.31,00:43:06.25
I'll never fly again.

00:43:07.48,00:43:09.04
Yes, without trees,

00:43:09.15,00:43:10.91
where would[br]the birdies live?

00:43:11.02,00:43:12.65
Forced to migrate[br]to the cities,

00:43:12.75,00:43:15.24
they would take jobs away[br]from local pigeons.

00:43:16.46,00:43:18.92
Bullwinkle,[br]they're listening!

00:43:19.03,00:43:20.22
( Cheering )

00:43:21.66,00:43:23.49
Yes, Bullwinkle's speech[br]was soinane...

00:43:23.60,00:43:26.23
that thestudents[br]couldn'tunderstand[br]a wordhe was saying,

00:43:26.33,00:43:29.10
andconsequently found[br]nothing to object to.

00:43:29.20,00:43:31.26
( Cheers )

00:43:38.61,00:43:40.41
So RockyandBullwinkle[br]bade a fondfarewell

00:43:40.51,00:43:42.95
to thehallowedwalls[br]ofWossamotta U.

00:43:43.05,00:43:44.71
Don't forget to write,[br]oldbuddy.

00:43:44.82,00:43:47.22
Bullwinkle,[br]who are you talking to?

00:43:47.32,00:43:48.35
I don't know,

00:43:48.46,00:43:50.92
but it's like[br]talking to a wall.

00:43:51.02,00:43:52.92
I want to thank you fellas[br]for bringing unity back

00:43:53.03,00:43:56.46
to this troubled campus[br]with your ludicrous remarks.

00:43:56.56,00:43:58.26
Martin and I would like[br]to wish you guys

00:43:58.37,00:43:59.96
Iuck against[br]Fearless Leader.

00:44:00.07,00:44:02.26
Yeah, and we would come[br]help you guys, but...

00:44:02.37,00:44:03.70
we don't wanna[br]get hurt.

00:44:03.80,00:44:05.90
Yeah, man, we're not[br]going near him.

00:44:06.01,00:44:07.20
Yeah, until we metyou guys,

00:44:07.31,00:44:09.71
we almost totally lost[br]faith in America.

00:44:09.81,00:44:11.47
Lewis:[br]Youknow, andwe[br]lostfaith in our car.

00:44:11.58,00:44:13.91
I used to think[br]our carwas really cool,

00:44:14.01,00:44:16.04
but now it'sjust[br]always dirty.

00:44:16.15,00:44:17.55
And running low on gas.

00:44:17.65,00:44:19.12
Yeah, but since we met you guys,[br]we love it again.

00:44:19.22,00:44:22.95
Yeah, the car is totally back.

00:44:23.06,00:44:24.72
So, as a gesture of our[br]appreciation,

00:44:24.83,00:44:26.88
we want you guys[br]to have it.

00:44:26.99,00:44:29.22
Yeah, so,[br]take the car.

00:44:29.33,00:44:31.23
Really?

00:44:31.33,00:44:32.66
It's yours.

00:44:32.77,00:44:33.89
Whoa!

00:44:36.07,00:44:37.80
Rocky:[br]Gee, fellas, thanks.

00:44:37.90,00:44:39.30
Yeah, thanks!

00:44:41.24,00:44:42.80
You do know how[br]to drive, right?

00:44:42.91,00:44:44.00
Please!

00:44:44.11,00:44:46.14
What moose can't[br]drive a automobile?

00:44:47.38,00:44:48.14
( Screeching )

00:44:51.08,00:44:53.25
Rocky:[br]Oh, brother!

00:44:56.06,00:44:57.68
Never said I could[br]drive it well.

00:45:00.19,00:45:02.82
Andjustas Rockyand[br]Bullwinkle got back[br]on the road,

00:45:02.93,00:45:05.36
Boris and Natasha emerged[br]from the student infiirmary,

00:45:05.47,00:45:06.99
ready foraction.

00:45:12.07,00:45:13.84
( Alarm Beeps )

00:45:13.94,00:45:15.77
Meanwhile, in Cow Tip,[br]Oklahoma...

00:45:17.21,00:45:18.27
Ole,

00:45:18.38,00:45:19.87
why don't you go[br]get the tickets,

00:45:19.98,00:45:21.17
and I'll park the truck?

00:45:23.12,00:45:24.67
Gosh, Karen!

00:45:24.79,00:45:26.51
I've never had[br]so much fun

00:45:26.62,00:45:27.85
in my whole life.

00:45:29.59,00:45:31.28
It's like--

00:45:31.39,00:45:34.36
It's like there was always[br]a little boy trapped...

00:45:34.46,00:45:36.19
somewhere inside me,

00:45:36.30,00:45:38.16
and now that I've met you,

00:45:38.27,00:45:40.63
I can finally[br]let him out.

00:46:15.47,00:46:17.70
Please, two for[br]the love movie.

00:46:17.80,00:46:20.10
There you go.

00:46:20.21,00:46:21.30
Tack.

00:46:33.35,00:46:35.58
Now, that's not verynice.

00:46:35.69,00:46:36.66
Shut up.

00:46:39.83,00:46:41.26
( Crowing )

00:46:42.63,00:46:44.19
As for Rocky and Bullwinkle,

00:46:44.30,00:46:47.29
they were gently motoring along[br]an Illinois interstate...

00:46:49.57,00:46:50.47
Hey, Rock,

00:46:50.57,00:46:52.60
there's that same town again!

00:46:52.71,00:46:55.33
Areyou sure we're[br]going the right way?

00:46:55.48,00:46:56.87
Bullwinkle, look out!

00:46:57.91,00:46:59.28
Whoa!

00:47:01.08,00:47:02.01
Rocky:[br]Sorry!

00:47:04.52,00:47:06.45
Bullwinkle, we're not[br]going to Chicago!

00:47:08.76,00:47:10.19
We are now.

00:47:10.19,00:47:10.49
We are now.

00:47:10.59,00:47:13.39
As our heroes found themselves[br]racing toward Chicago,

00:47:13.49,00:47:16.83
Iittle did they realize[br]that only a few miles behind...

00:47:19.77,00:47:21.60
And back in Cow Tip,[br]Oklahoma,

00:47:21.70,00:47:24.30
the only person in this movie[br]more clueless than Bullwinkle

00:47:24.40,00:47:26.30
faithfully waited for Karen[br]to get back

00:47:26.41,00:47:29.90
from parking his truck.

00:47:30.01,00:47:32.64
But our heroine was already[br]passing through lndiana...

00:47:32.75,00:47:36.08
where she was about tomake[br]an ominous discovery.

00:47:45.76,00:47:48.66
Announcer:[br]For watching miserable people[br]suffer in daytime,

00:47:48.76,00:47:51.03
it's The Jenny Spy Show.

00:47:51.13,00:47:54.16
Are you sorry that[br]you called her fat?

00:47:54.27,00:47:56.53
( Crying )[br]Yes! Yes!

00:47:56.64,00:47:59.70
Oh, no![br]Not already!

00:48:02.21,00:48:03.87
Yes, Fearless Leader's[br]hypnotic broadcast...

00:48:03.98,00:48:05.84
was already underway.

00:48:05.95,00:48:09.64
Announcer:[br]You are watching premiere[br]broadcast of RBTV.

00:48:09.75,00:48:11.51
( Applause )

00:48:11.62,00:48:14.61
Ah, I love my RBTV.

00:48:16.26,00:48:17.81
Fearless Leader!

00:48:17.92,00:48:19.12
The zombombidor shows

00:48:19.23,00:48:22.92
that 30% of despised,[br]decadent Americans

00:48:23.06,00:48:24.72
are already total zombies!

00:48:24.83,00:48:26.06
Good!

00:48:26.17,00:48:28.36
I'll address the nation[br]at exactly 8:00 PM

00:58:37.81,00:58:38.57
Look!

00:58:42.38,00:58:44.28
it was too late.

00:58:44.38,00:58:46.61
- Stop! Stop![br]- Stop!

00:58:46.72,00:58:48.77
Stop!

00:59:01.83,00:59:03.09
( Sighing )

00:59:09.74,00:59:12.26
That certainly[br]was a close one.

00:59:12.37,00:59:14.34
Let's just hope this thing[br]makes it all the way[br]to New York.

00:59:24.05,00:59:26.45
Where did we go wrong, Boris?

00:59:26.56,00:59:28.72
We tried[br]to blow them up.

00:59:28.82,00:59:30.79
We tried[br]to have them arrested.

00:59:30.89,00:59:33.83
We tried[br]to degenerate them.

00:59:33.93,00:59:35.62
We tried to smush them.

00:59:35.73,00:59:37.46
Yes, and we never[br]even came close.

00:59:39.50,00:59:40.47
Oh, Boris,

00:59:40.57,00:59:42.66
what are we[br]doing, darling?

00:59:42.77,00:59:44.67
We been trying to catch[br]moose and squirrel...

00:59:44.77,00:59:46.90
ever since[br]we first got drawn.

00:59:47.01,00:59:49.50
We tried to stab them,[br]shoot them, smash them,

00:59:49.61,00:59:53.17
smush them, crush them,[br]bash them, mash them

00:59:53.28,00:59:55.34
and they don't even[br]know our names.

00:59:56.59,00:59:58.11
I'm tired[br]ofall this, Boris.

00:59:58.22,01:00:00.09
I don't want to be[br]spy no more.

01:00:00.19,01:00:03.06
Let's faceit, darling,[br]we suck.

01:00:04.93,01:00:07.23
We can never catch[br]moose and squirrel.

01:00:10.73,01:00:12.36
Boris...

01:00:12.47,01:00:14.87
don't you want to have[br]little Boris? Hmmm?

01:00:16.91,01:00:18.67
Little Natasha?

01:00:19.91,01:00:23.54
Wouldn't it be[br]wonderful?

01:00:23.65,01:00:27.21
We could rent cottage[br]by sea of Pottsylvania

01:00:27.32,01:00:31.65
and teach them how to lie,[br]and cheat and be rotten.

01:00:31.75,01:00:34.95
They would be worst[br]children in world!

01:00:35.06,01:00:37.22
They'd be monsters.

01:00:37.33,01:00:39.82
It would be awful!

01:00:39.93,01:00:41.76
We could be so happy.

01:00:45.10,01:00:48.66

01:00:57.51,01:00:59.21
( Yawning )

01:01:01.12,01:01:03.45
Well, Badenov,[br]did the C.D.I. work?

01:01:03.59,01:01:06.08
Oh, it--[br]it works all right!

01:01:07.52,01:01:09.49
So moose and squirrel[br]are dead, then?

01:01:11.16,01:01:13.25
Well, is funny[br]you should ask...

01:01:13.36,01:01:14.49
Yes, Fearless Leader!

01:01:14.60,01:01:16.59
We killed moose[br]and squirrel!

01:01:17.70,01:01:18.53
Excellent!

01:01:18.63,01:01:20.83
( Applause )

01:01:20.94,01:01:22.70
Wait there for[br]my private jet.

01:01:22.80,01:01:25.00
I want you both beside[br]my side for the big broadcast.

01:01:29.98,01:01:31.78
- Natasha...[br]- Yes, darling?

01:01:31.88,01:01:33.25
Why did you[br]tell him that?!

01:01:33.35,01:01:35.08
Because, Boris!

01:01:35.18,01:01:37.05
Moose and squirrel[br]can't reach New York...

01:01:37.15,01:01:39.78
by 8:00 PM in[br]that little plane.

01:01:39.89,01:01:42.38
And what ifthey did?[br]So what?

01:01:42.49,01:01:44.46
How could they[br]stop us now?

01:01:44.56,01:01:48.43
Practicallywhole country[br]is zombifiied!

01:01:48.53,01:01:52.30
We've won, Boris![br]We've won!

01:01:52.40,01:01:54.80
just the way[br]I planned it!

01:01:54.90,01:01:56.84
( Cackling )

01:01:58.07,01:01:59.37
On their way to New York,

01:01:59.44,01:02:01.20
our heroes were soon[br]to discover...

01:02:01.31,01:02:03.17
that old Jeb was right.

01:02:03.28,01:02:05.34
( Beeping )

01:02:05.45,01:02:07.68
She won't pull up,[br]we're too heavy!

01:02:15.12,01:02:16.95
Rocky,[br]can you fly Bullwinkle down?

01:02:17.06,01:02:18.53
I don't think so,[br]Karen.

01:02:18.66,01:02:20.22
He's a huge moose!

01:02:20.33,01:02:23.13
I beg your pardon![br]I'm as trim as a young fawn!

01:02:23.23,01:02:25.83
You weigh 400[br]imaginary pounds!

01:02:25.97,01:02:28.20
Yeah, but[br]it's all "mooscle."

01:02:28.30,01:02:30.29
Bullwinkle, can you fly[br]an airplane?

01:02:30.41,01:02:32.81
What moose can't[br]fly a aeroplane?

01:02:32.91,01:02:34.17
Rocky, you'll have[br]to fly me down.

01:02:34.31,01:02:35.47
I can't do that, Karen.

01:02:35.58,01:02:37.64
I can't fly again![br]I've lost the knack.

01:02:37.75,01:02:39.74
Bullwinkle,[br]take the controls.

01:02:39.85,01:02:40.78
Okay.

01:02:42.65,01:02:43.88
Listen to me, Rocky.

01:02:43.99,01:02:45.42
- You can do this.[br]- I can't!

01:02:45.52,01:02:47.08
- I knowyou can do this.[br]- I just can't!

01:02:47.19,01:02:50.32
This is everything you taught me[br]since I was a little kid.

01:02:50.43,01:02:51.76
All you have to do[br]is believe in --

01:02:51.86,01:02:54.09
( Screaming )

01:02:54.20,01:02:55.13
Rocky:[br]Karen!

01:02:57.77,01:02:59.79
Look out for the sign!

01:03:00.87,01:03:02.00
Aaah!

01:03:04.77,01:03:06.37
Here goes n-nothing!

01:03:12.95,01:03:13.85

01:03:15.25,01:03:16.01
Rocky!

01:03:19.55,01:03:21.15
Uh-oh!

01:03:27.36,01:03:28.35
Together:[br]Bullwinkle!

01:03:37.71,01:03:39.87
Never said[br]I could fly it well.

01:03:39.98,01:03:42.00
See you in New York!

01:03:46.95,01:03:48.97
Hang on, Karen![br]Hang on!

01:03:49.08,01:03:50.61
If l couldjust...

01:03:50.72,01:03:52.52
( Grunting )

01:03:55.66,01:03:56.89
Rocky!

01:03:56.99,01:03:58.12
You're flying!

01:03:58.23,01:04:00.56
- You're flying![br]- Yes, I am!

01:04:00.66,01:04:02.22
I certainly am.

01:04:02.33,01:04:04.39
Look at me![br]I'm flying!

01:04:04.50,01:04:07.02
New York City,[br]here we come!

01:04:07.14,01:04:08.63

01:04:08.74,01:04:10.00
Yeah!

What a day, a year,[br]a life it is! 

01:04:13.34,01:04:16.24
You know 

01:04:16.34,01:04:19.91
Well, you know[br]you had it coming toyou 

01:04:20.02,01:04:23.18

01:04:25.59,01:04:28.72
A stupid little dreamer

01:04:28.82,01:04:32.56
 So now you putyour head[br]in your hands, oh, no! 

01:04:32.66,01:04:33.75
Whoo! 

01:04:35.96,01:04:36.73
( Popping )

01:04:40.77,01:04:42.60
Boris, darling,

01:04:42.70,01:04:45.10
how can you be[br]so rotten?

01:04:45.21,01:04:48.37
When I stop[br]moose and squirrel[br]from saving country,

01:04:48.48,01:04:50.64
( Glass Tinkles )[br]I don't kid around!

01:05:12.90,01:05:14.63
Karen looked upon[br]the brave little squirrel

01:05:14.74,01:05:17.14
with a new admiration.

01:05:17.24,01:05:19.40
However, she couldn't[br]help but wonder,

01:05:19.51,01:05:20.94
were they too late?

01:05:27.75,01:05:30.08
Soaringprecipitously[br]overRockefellerCenter,

01:05:30.19,01:05:32.75
Karen and Rocky found[br]the entire city of New York

01:05:32.85,01:05:34.65
completely zombifiied.

01:05:36.42,01:05:37.65
Rocky,[br]whatever you do,

01:05:37.76,01:05:39.66
don't look at the screen!

01:05:43.93,01:05:45.92
Touching down[br]outside RBTV,

01:05:46.03,01:05:48.06
the daring duo was soon[br]to discover

01:05:48.20,01:05:51.23
that something else[br]was terribly wrong.

01:05:51.37,01:05:53.77
Where's Bullwinkle?[br]The speech starts any minute!

01:05:53.88,01:05:55.50
I knew we shouldn't[br]have lefthim.

01:05:55.61,01:05:58.84
Bullwinkle and I have never[br]been apart in 35 years!

01:06:01.92,01:06:03.35
Quick, Rock, follow me.

01:06:14.26,01:06:15.96
Come, Natasha.

01:06:16.06,01:06:18.59

01:06:35.32,01:06:36.91
Oh, Fearless Leader!

01:06:39.99,01:06:42.39
We're back!

01:06:42.49,01:06:45.39
You are so-oo[br]happy to see us...!

01:06:45.49,01:06:47.96
Well, Fearless Leader,[br]he did it!

Well, no one can stop[br]my broadcast now!

01:07:43.72,01:07:45.28
FBl! Freeze!

No one but these[br]chocolate-chewing idiots!

01:07:51.73,01:07:53.19
All right, I want anyone[br]in this room...

01:07:53.29,01:07:55.96
who's a Pottsylvanian spy[br]to putyour hands up now!

01:07:58.73,01:08:00.43
That means you, too,[br]Fearless Leader!

01:08:00.54,01:08:01.76
Let me see your hands!

01:08:01.87,01:08:04.46
All right,[br]Agent Sympathy.

01:08:04.57,01:08:07.77
We don't want anybody[br]to be hurt, now do we?

01:08:07.88,01:08:09.81
And whatever you're holding,[br]drop it!

01:08:11.35,01:08:12.34
Gladly.

01:08:14.42,01:08:15.58
Don't look, Rocky,[br]it's a trick.

01:08:15.68,01:08:17.15
It'll turn you into a...

01:08:17.25,01:08:18.45
Rocky!

01:08:20.16,01:08:21.21
Rocky?

01:08:21.32,01:08:22.38
Oh-hh!

Peek-a-boopsie!

01:08:24.43,01:08:26.92
Fearless Leader:[br]Well, Agent Sympathy,

01:08:27.03,01:08:29.00
I have waited manyyears

01:08:29.10,01:08:32.79
to face an enemy[br]I could respect...

01:08:32.90,01:08:34.33
and I'm still waiting!

01:08:34.44,01:08:35.84
( Laughing )

01:08:35.94,01:08:38.57
No, that was just[br]a little joke.

01:08:38.67,01:08:41.16
But I'm afraid that you[br]and this flying rodent

01:08:41.28,01:08:43.74
have reached the end[br]of the road.

01:08:43.85,01:08:47.51
Now get ready for a taste of[br]Pottsylvanian hospitability.

01:08:47.62,01:08:51.78
That's ability to put you[br]in hospital, darling.

01:08:51.89,01:08:52.98
( Chuckling )

01:08:53.09,01:08:54.58
Andso, Rocky and Karen's[br]onlyhope

01:08:54.69,01:08:58.35
in the whole wide world[br]was BullwinkleJ. Moose.

01:08:58.46,01:09:01.26
In other words,[br]they didn'thave aprayer.

01:09:01.36,01:09:03.35
For Bullwinkle hadmanaged[br]to miss New York altogether

01:09:03.47,01:09:06.53
and had flown instead[br]to Washington, D. C.

01:09:06.63,01:09:10.09
Gee, New York sure has[br]changed a lot since my day.

01:09:10.21,01:09:12.50
They even moved[br]the White House here.

01:09:12.61,01:09:13.54
( Yelling )

01:09:19.45,01:09:20.88
Couldn't fii nd the brakes.

01:09:23.89,01:09:25.35
Well, as long as I'm here,

01:09:25.45,01:09:28.79
I might as well talk to[br]the president about the trees!

01:09:28.89,01:09:30.38
( Echoing )[br]Anybody home?

01:09:32.13,01:09:34.03

share.

01:09:39.93,01:09:42.63
As foryou, my friends,[br]we have planned...

01:09:42.74,01:09:44.73
something quite special.

01:09:51.68,01:09:54.91
We are hooking you directly[br]into the quality control.

01:09:55.02,01:09:56.24
As soon as we g olive,

01:09:56.35,01:09:58.15
the current will pass[br]throughyourbrain

01:09:58.25,01:10:00.92
and you will be turned[br]intoahelpless,

01:10:01.02,01:10:03.39
mindless vegetable.

01:10:04.66,01:10:06.32
But don't worry...[br]it won'thurt.

01:10:06.43,01:10:07.69
At least, I never[br]heard a complaint

01:10:07.80,01:10:10.42
from the other vegetables.

01:10:14.97,01:10:16.23
I think your ecognize

01:10:16.34,01:10:18.64
your three missing colleagues[br]from the FBl?

01:10:20.61,01:10:22.60
Help us! Help!

01:10:25.78,01:10:28.11
I'm sorry, Rocky,[br]I've really done it this time.

01:10:28.22,01:10:30.28
Don't worry, Karen,[br]you need the most faith

01:10:30.39,01:10:32.11
when things look[br]the most hopeless.

01:10:32.22,01:10:34.12
Thanks, Rocky.

01:10:34.22,01:10:35.78
And, Karen...

01:10:35.89,01:10:38.29
this is pretty hopeless.

01:10:39.79,01:10:41.02
Look,

01:10:41.13,01:10:43.26
we don't care[br]what you do to us...

01:10:43.36,01:10:46.39
just leave America alone!

01:10:46.50,01:10:49.30
( Laughing )[br]Ah, America...

01:10:49.40,01:10:50.50
( Laughing )

01:10:52.41,01:10:54.53
I'm proud of you, Karen.

01:10:55.64,01:10:57.24
Listen,[br]Fearless Leader:

01:10:57.35,01:10:59.07
If there's one thing[br]this plucky squirrel[br]has shown me,

01:10:59.18,01:11:01.27
it's that you have[br]to be who you are,

01:11:01.38,01:11:04.15
no matter how much pressure[br]there is to change!

01:11:04.25,01:11:05.31
Yay!

01:11:06.82,01:11:08.38
Anddespite[br]this inspiring vindication

01:11:08.49,01:11:09.75
ofKaren's innerchild,

01:11:09.86,01:11:11.95
Fearless Leader[br]was unimpressed.

01:11:14.43,01:11:16.42
So Karen, Rocky,[br]andthe entire nation...

01:11:16.53,01:11:19.00
werepoisedon thebrink[br]ofunimaginableperil.

01:11:20.10,01:11:21.50
And there is no one--

01:11:21.60,01:11:23.59
I said no one--

01:11:23.71,01:11:25.50
who can stop me now!

01:11:28.61,01:11:31.67
Or, in fact,[br]was there...?

01:11:31.78,01:11:33.11
Soyou see,[br]Mr. President,

01:11:33.21,01:11:35.68
all the trees in[br]Frostbite Falls are gone.

01:11:35.78,01:11:38.01
The birds have no place[br]to put their things.

01:11:38.12,01:11:40.61
The children have no place[br]to build their tree house.

01:11:40.72,01:11:41.85
I built them a stump house,

01:11:41.96,01:11:44.25
but they say it's just[br]not the same.

01:11:44.36,01:11:45.72
Please help[br]when you have time.

01:11:47.63,01:11:48.82
But Gorka,

01:11:48.93,01:11:51.16
the horse has swallowed[br]the transmitter!

01:11:51.27,01:11:52.32
Not again!

01:11:52.43,01:11:54.80
( Laughter)

01:11:54.90,01:11:58.53

01:12:02.14,01:12:03.61
Bullwinkle!

01:12:03.71,01:12:05.37
Don't watch!

01:12:05.48,01:12:06.57
Bullwinkle!

01:12:08.88,01:12:11.08
Oh, no![br]Notyou, too!

01:12:13.05,01:12:15.32
Not a bad show,[br]eh, Mr. President?

01:12:15.42,01:12:16.69
Yes, cheap as itmayseem--

01:12:16.79,01:12:18.22
anditcertainly[br]does seem cheap--

01:12:18.33,01:12:19.99
Bullwinkle's head[br]was so thick

01:12:20.09,01:12:21.89
that Fearless Leader's[br] mind-numbing programming

01:12:22.00,01:12:24.49
had absolutely no effect[br]on him whatsoever.

01:12:24.60,01:12:25.46
Come here!

01:12:27.14,01:12:28.47
At least one thing[br]hasn't changed!

01:12:28.60,01:12:30.23
TV's as good as ever!

01:12:30.34,01:12:32.70
Bullwinkle,[br]allow me to be frank.

01:12:32.81,01:12:33.71
Okay, Frank,

01:12:33.81,01:12:35.78
allow me to be[br]Bullwinkle.

01:12:35.91,01:12:37.88
I'm Cappy[br]Von Trappment, FBl.

01:12:37.98,01:12:39.34
I thoughtyou said[br]your name was Frank.

01:12:39.45,01:12:41.04
- Shut up, Bullwinkle![br]- Okay, Frank.

01:12:41.15,01:12:42.74
As we speak,

01:12:42.85,01:12:45.41
99% ofthe country is slobbering[br]in front ofthe television.

01:12:45.52,01:12:47.75
- What's so strange about that?[br]- Listen to me!

01:12:47.86,01:12:49.91
We haven't heard from Karen,[br]I think she and Rocky...

01:12:50.02,01:12:51.58
are in terrible danger.

01:12:51.69,01:12:53.02
You've got to get[br]to New York!

01:12:53.13,01:12:54.42
I thought this was New York.

01:12:54.53,01:12:55.89
No, Bullwinkle,

01:12:56.00,01:12:58.93
that's Washington out there![br]That's Washington!

01:12:59.03,01:13:00.50
Really?

01:13:00.60,01:13:03.50
Where's that[br]little white wig[br]he always wears?

01:13:03.60,01:13:04.50
It's no use.

01:13:07.48,01:13:10.77
Fearless Leader's speech starts[br]in less than two minutes.

01:13:10.88,01:13:13.51
There's no way anyone[br]could get there in time now.

01:13:13.61,01:13:15.08
Oh, butterballs!

01:13:15.18,01:13:16.95
If only there were[br]some way of transmitting

01:13:17.05,01:13:18.95
computer-generated[br]animated characters

01:13:19.05,01:13:21.99
across great distances[br]in the blink of an eye.

01:13:23.06,01:13:25.08
Bullwinkle![br]That's it!

01:13:25.19,01:13:26.35
It is?

01:13:26.46,01:13:28.95
Yes, it's our[br]only chance!

01:13:29.06,01:13:30.93
We're gonna E-mail you[br]to Karen in New York.

01:13:31.03,01:13:32.12
Well, okay,[br]but don'tyou think...

01:13:32.23,01:13:33.63
she'd rather get flowers?

01:13:33.74,01:13:35.79
just shut up[br]and hold on!

01:13:35.90,01:13:38.80
- Okay![br]- One... two...

01:13:38.91,01:13:40.27
three!

01:13:42.08,01:13:43.98
And squeezing into[br]the scanner drive...

01:13:44.08,01:13:47.38
Bullwinkle found himself inside[br]the presidential computer.

01:13:47.48,01:13:48.38
( Computer Beeps )

01:13:51.59,01:13:52.99
Butback atRBTV,

01:13:53.09,01:13:55.61
Fearless Leader's deadly[br]countdown hadjustbegun.

01:13:55.72,01:13:58.25
1 5, 1 4...

01:13:58.36,01:14:00.22
( Machine Beeps )

01:14:00.33,01:14:01.90
1 2...

01:14:01.90,01:14:02.23
1 2...

01:14:02.33,01:14:05.46
And that's when Bullwinkle[br]snapped into action.

01:14:05.57,01:14:07.90
Look, Frank,[br]solitaire.

01:14:08.00,01:14:09.26
I'm sorry, Bullwinkle,

01:14:09.37,01:14:10.84
we don't have time[br]for that!

01:14:12.61,01:14:14.58
With the coolagility[br]ofajungle cat,

01:14:14.68,01:14:17.74
our heroic moose grabbed the[br]corners of the E-mail envelope

01:14:17.85,01:14:19.90
and hung on for[br]the ride ofhis life.

01:14:20.01,01:14:22.64
Eight, seven,

01:14:22.75,01:14:24.15
si-i...

01:14:24.25,01:14:27.24
While time stood virtually[br]still at RBTV,

01:14:30.22,01:14:32.12
Bullwinkle surfed[br]the information super highway

01:14:32.23,01:14:34.35
onhis way tosave the day.

01:14:34.46,01:14:36.66
Look, I'm hangin' four!

01:14:54.92,01:14:57.08
( Stuttering )[br]S-S-Surf's up, dude!

01:14:59.15,01:15:00.68
Hang on, Rocky!

01:15:00.79,01:15:02.55
I'm coming!

01:15:05.83,01:15:08.63
Bullwinkle found himself[br]inside the RBTV computer...

01:15:08.73,01:15:09.70
Five...

01:15:09.80,01:15:11.53

01:15:11.63,01:15:13.53
...with only seconds left[br]to spare and no idea[br]how to get out.

01:15:13.63,01:15:14.86

01:15:14.97,01:15:16.90

Andusing his brain,

01:15:22.68,01:15:25.08
Bullwinkle activated[br]the 'print"icon...

01:15:25.18,01:15:27.17
but was hein time?

01:15:27.28,01:15:28.75

01:15:46.83,01:15:47.86
Yes, America,

01:15:47.97,01:15:50.77

Yes, America, I will bring[br]order to the government.

Look, it's moose!

than his might yantlers[br]momentarily jammed

Sir, there's one thing[br]I still don't understand.

01:19:56.22,01:19:57.68
Why did you pick me[br]for this mission?

01:19:57.79,01:20:00.52
I mean, I'm clearly[br]not FBI material.
