Against the telephone at $8,000.

5
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,224
Against the room at $8,000.
Anyone canjoin in.

6
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,518
Thank you. $9,000. $10,000.

7
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,855
$11,000. $12,000. Any more?

8
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,983
She's still talking,
but now she's got her mum on the line.

9
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,152
So, sold to you, sir, for $12,000.

10
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,530
You are bidder number 909.

11
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,658
Moving on. Lot number 84.

12
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,077
Oil on canvas, dated 1870.

13
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,788
La Femme Chez Aube, which translates as:

14
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,418
"Woman with massive bottom. "

15
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,087
This one is signed by Rudolf Waldemar...

16
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,965
...authenticated by no less
than Dr. Briskind...

17
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,677
...and bidding up here at $14,000.

18
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,056
$15,000 at the back.

20
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,434
$19,000. $20,000.

21
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,144
$21,000. $22,000.

22
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,730
$23,000.

23
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,106
No more?

24
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,359
All through.

25
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,403
All done. And.... Yes! Thank you, sir.

26
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,157
New bidder. Gentleman
on the left of the aisle, $24,000.

27
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,576
Not really. It's a crueljoke.

28
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,371
Sold to you, sir, for $23,000...

29
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,332
...or $11,500 per buttock.

30
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,542
Lot number 85.

31
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,797
German school. Ã–d und klar ist das Meer.

32
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,470
Right.

33
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,598
This is very embarrassing.

34
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,477
It now turns out that lots 85
through to the end ofyour catalog...

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,981
...are, in fact, not actually here.
Delivery problem.

36
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:55,068
If it's any consolation,
we feel as stupid as I'm sure we look.

37
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,903
Thank you very much.

38
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,656
This is pathetic!

39
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,993
It's a nightmare. We're a laughingstock.

40
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,828
-They just showed up.
-The trucks?

41
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,248
Just in time for the end of the auction.
Remind me to thank them.

42
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,500
Helen, everything's fixed for tonight?

43
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,461
Great. The reservation, flowers,
all that stuff?

44
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,754
All taken care of.

45
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,465
Brilliant. Thank you so much. Thanks.

46
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:23,013
Listen, you don't think
three months is too soon, do you?

47
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,850
I haven't even met her family yet.
What do you think, as a woman?

48
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,644
As a woman? Very risky.

49
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:33,898
Right. Well, thanks.
That's made me feel a lot better.

50
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,030
You've brought me just under
half the paintings just over...

51
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,949
...two weeks late
for the fifth time this year.

52
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,744
You gonna sign or do I take it all back?

53
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,580
That's it, is it?
That's your response to this?

54
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,625
All right, guys, load it up.

55
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,878
I'll sign. Lovely.

56
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,589
Thank you so much.
You've been a huge help.

57
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,924
Note: Call Better Business Bureau.

58
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,678
Other note: Seek lost testicles.

59
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,306
Michael? Need a lift?

60
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,268
That's nice of you.
I'm actually picking up Gina from school.

61
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,021
That's fine. We're going that way. Hop in.

62
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,441
Do you know Mr. Morganson?
Michael Felgate.

63
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,985
Very nice to meet you.
We're very excited...

64
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,739
...that you might be thinking of us
for your father's collection.

65
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,575
Mr. Morganson was at today's sale.

66
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,079
Well, not typical, if I may say so.

67
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:34,292
I think every auction house in New York
has these delivery hiccups.

68
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,045
Sotheby's doesn't seem to.

69
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,007
Right.

70
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,020
I heard about tonight. Best of luck.

71
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,522
Thanks.

72
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,808
Go, girl!

73
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,896
So? Where are we going?

74
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,983
I am unable to tell you,
but it's somewhere very special.

75
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,442
Goodbye!

76
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,570
'Bye, Miss Vitale!

77
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,238
And we're late. Run!

78
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,625
Please don't!

79
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,504
What? Don't what?

80
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,548
Just stop.

81
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,885
Just stop. Otherwise, I can't go on.
Just run normally.

82
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,140
I am running normally.

83
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,520
Right, I'm sorry. I thought, you know....

84
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,733
I haven't seen you run before,
and I thought you were doing a funny run.

85
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,445
A funny run? That's my run.

86
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,865
What time is it?

87
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,077
We're now 25 minutes late.

88
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,621
We've lost our reservation.
What do you think?

89
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,458
I can't think. I'm much
too hurt about my run.

90
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,544
We'll go somewhere else. And let's walk.

91
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,923
Thanks.

92
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,471
Are you okay?

93
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,557
-You look a little fishy.
-No, I'm fine.

94
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,061
How was last night?

95
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,812
Fine. The usual.

96
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,481
Your dad okay?

97
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,649
He's great.

98
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,323
I'm sorry. I want you to meet him
and Ritchie. It's just--

99
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,118
You're ashamed of me. I talk funny.
My hair's unusually fluffy.

100
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,703
Just give me time.

101
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,832
Tell me what his restaurant's called
so I can sneak in, in a beard.

102
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,294
It's called The La Trattoria.

103
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,838
You mean La Trattoria.

104
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,882
No.

105
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,594
The La Trattoria means
"The The Trattoria."

106
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,054
I know.

107
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,264
Interesting.

108
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:40,770
Look, I've gotta go to the la bathroom
and I'll be back in a sec.

109
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,573
Hi.

110
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,203
I was wondering if you could help me out
with a special arrangement.

111
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,084
I've got this fortune, and I wondered
if you could stick it in a fortune cookie.

112
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,127
Thank you.

113
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,463
Welcome!

114
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,424
Thanks.

115
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,177
-Thank you.
-Welcome!

116
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,808
She wants you to pay now.

117
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:22,144
No! You eat cookie.

118
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,360
Looks like we better eat our cookies.

119
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,450
"You like Chinese food."

120
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,785
That's spooky.

121
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,954
You gonna check yours?

122
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,331
No, I'm gonna save it for later.

123
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,833
Eat cookie.

124
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,586
-She will when she's ready.
-No, you have it.

125
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,212
No, you eat cookie.

126
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,631
I don't want to.

127
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,054
-Eat cookie.
-I'm not hungry!

128
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,806
The best thing is to play along.

129
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,600
I won't take orders from a waitress.

130
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,269
Not waitress! Owner! Eat fucking cookie!

131
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,645
This woman is insane.

132
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,980
Gina, do you love me?

133
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:06,897
Yeah.

134
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,357
-Do you trust me?
-Yeah.

135
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,484
Then, eat the cookie.

136
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,749
"Good fences make good neighbors."

137
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,959
Oh, my God! Jeffrey!

138
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,380
The answer is yes! Oh, my God!

139
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,882
Honey, I can't--

140
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,217
-Excuse me.
-What are you talking about?

141
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,596
I am so sorry. There's been a mistake.
That's actually your one.

142
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,514
It's quite true too.

143
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,685
This is what you're meant to have.

144
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,855
And...

145
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,398
...this.

146
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,820
Oh, my God....

147
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,656
Two karat.

148
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,366
How much money? What you pay?

149
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,161
We could really use some privacy here.
Thanks.

150
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,497
Just give us a moment.

151
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,916
-I'm not waitress. Owner. My restaurant!
-I know!

152
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,334
Go away!

153
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,257
Michael! My God!

154
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,346
I don't know what to say.

155
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,057
I thought what she said was pretty good.

156
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,936
Obviously, you could leave out
the Jeffrey bit.

157
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,565
I can't. I'm sorry.

158
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,787
I'm so sorry.

159
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,539
It was just....

160
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,063
Hi, Jimmy. Listen,
did Gina just come back?

161
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,774
She came back, all right,
crying her eyes out.

162
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,028
She packed a bag, ran back out again.
What the hell you been doing to her?

163
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,908
I asked her to marry me.

164
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,993
No!

165
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,245
Are you kidding me?

166
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,668
Come here, you. This is great!

167
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,838
She didn't, by any chance,
say where she was going?

168
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,631
She went to her dad's house.

169
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,925
You don't have that address
by any chance?

170
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,885
No, I don't. But you could ask him.

171
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,264
He's got a restaurant right around
the block. Corner of Mulberry.

172
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,224
Right, The La Trattoria.

173
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,934
That's the one.

174
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,770
You dog, you.

175
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:55,065
I am a bit of a dog.
Thanks so much, Jimmy.

176
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,110
Hey, all the best!

177
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,371
Hi, it's Jimmy. Is Mr. Vitale in?

178
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,791
-You want Frank?
-I got some great news for him.

179
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:51,455
Excuse me. I was hoping
you might be able to tell me--

180
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,082
You're Michael.

181
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,584
I'm Ritchie.

182
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,877
Right!

183
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,089
Great to meet you.

184
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,091
You look a lot like Gina.

185
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,676
You don't look like her at all.

186
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,929
I'll go get my dad.

187
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,764
No, that's okay.

188
00:14:08,972 --> 00:14:11,183
I just needed his home address.

189
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,855
You're Gina's guy.

190
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,273
Right.

191
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:20,901
You own that auction house.

192
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,195
No, I just run it for the owner.

193
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,573
Interesting line of business.

194
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:30,410
What's the deal with that?
You get to pick the paintings?

195
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,997
I used to. Now I just pick fights
with truck drivers.

196
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,209
-Delivery problems?
-Right, yeah.

197
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,837
You know, I love art.

198
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,049
What's that supposed to mean?

199
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,634
Johnny, it don't mean nothing.

200
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,219
-Vinnie.
-What'd I say?

201
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:51,056
You know what you said.
You like the guy? You find him attractive?

202
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,683
Chrissakes, Johnny!

203
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,727
-Something's going on here!
-Nothing's going on!

204
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,369
I apologize. My son is very emotional.

205
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,414
Artistic.

206
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,875
I think you understand.

207
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,168
Absolutely.

208
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:23,630
I hate to disturb Mr. Vitale.

209
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,592
I was just wondering,
does anyone have his home--

210
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,136
Mr. Vitale.

211
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,055
My God! Michael, finally.

212
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,517
You know, Gina keeps telling me
how busy you are...

213
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,686
...but better late than never.

214
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,229
-Right?
-Right.

215
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,773
-So did you meet everyone?
-I think so.

216
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:42,941
Vinnie.

217
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,359
Carmine. Louie.

218
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:45,944
That is Uncle Vito.

219
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,654
-A pleasure.
-Likewise.

220
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,407
So, right.... Are you mostly family, then?

221
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,037
Mostly.

222
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,416
You two should talk.

223
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:00,542
Right.

224
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:04,254
Good luck with them trucks.

225
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,549
Thanks. Mr. Vitale,
it's really nice to meet you at last.

226
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,135
I just dropped by to ask you a question.

227
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,140
Is that right, a question? I have an idea
what that question might be.

228
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,391
You do?

229
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:20,812
But, if we're gonna do this right,
shouldn't we get to know each other first?

230
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,648
Yeah.

231
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,566
-Of course.
-I suppose so.

232
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:28,487
You know something, Michael...

233
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,406
...l think I'm gonna like you.

234
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:34,534
I believe very deeply in first impressions.

235
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,538
I fell in love with my wife at first sight.
And the minute they showed...

236
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,210
...that Charles Manson on the news,
I said, "l know this guy's up to no good."

237
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:49,091
Now I see you for the first time
and I know you love my daughter.

238
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,761
Look, Mr. Vitale, here's the thing--

239
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,096
Frank.

240
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,681
I wanna show you something.

241
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,768
For chrissakes, Ritchie,
I can't hear myself think!

242
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,645
What's wrong with you?

243
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,355
I don't know!

244
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,779
The kid's got a 174 IQ,
and what do you get? An idiot.

245
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,907
I mean, he's my son and I love him.

246
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,411
And I wish there was another word.
There isn't.

247
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,913
Mr. Vitale, do you have a bathroom?

248
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:24,000
Down the hall. You can't miss it.
Come upstairs when you're through.

249
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:10,714
Take a look at this.

250
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,344
There's a man in the freezer.

251
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,180
I know. Maintenance.

252
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,683
Come here, come here. Come here!

253
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,687
You recognize this person?

254
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:29,566
The best student they ever had.
Here she is with her mother.

255
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,654
Gina has her eyes, you'll notice.

256
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:38,199
About a week after this day,
her mother passed away.

257
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:42,746
A week after that, Gina was back in school,
studying harder than before...

258
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:47,542
...coming home every night,
trying to take care of me and Ritchie.

259
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,712
She's still doing it.

260
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,714
I apologize.

261
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:59,679
But as you may have guessed...

262
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:02,182
...l am crazy about my Gina.

263
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,434
My God, I am so thrilled...

264
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,480
...she met someone who knows
exactly how she deserves to be treated.

265
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,731
Right.

266
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:11,483
Like a fucking princess.

267
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:17,530
Mr. Vitale, I think I should really tell you
about what happened tonight.

268
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,745
I got a confession to make.
I already know.

269
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,915
-You do?
-Well, her doorman called me.

270
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:33,213
When he called with the good news,
I knew this Michael, he's a gentleman.

271
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:36,007
He's coming to ask for my daughter's hand.

272
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,469
Go ahead.

273
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:48,103
May l...

274
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:52,315
...please have your daughter's hand
in marriage...

275
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:54,776
...Mr. Vitale?

276
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,197
Frank?

277
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:02,617
Dad.

278
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:04,035
Yes.

279
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:06,621
What a kid.

280
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,306
I'm sleeping, Daddy.

281
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:29,352
It's me.

282
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,654
I love you so much.

283
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:42,031
Well, I love you.

284
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:44,492
Then why did you have to do this?

285
00:20:45,743 --> 00:20:48,288
Everything was perfect.
Why did you have to ruin it?

286
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,331
I didn't mean to.

287
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:52,459
I just thought--

288
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,878
I know! And I do!

289
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,672
I do so much!

290
00:20:58,381 --> 00:20:59,716
Well, that's great.

291
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,051
That's fantastic.

292
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,429
But I can't! l....

293
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,389
I just can't!

294
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,266
Gina, I'm not following.

295
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:13,980
-What's happening?
-I can't talk about this in the house.

296
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:17,108
So where are we going?

297
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:18,610
Out.

298
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,905
Right. Nowhere too dressy, I hope.

299
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,377
I can't marry you, because of my father.

300
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,922
Your father?

301
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,718
I just met your father.

302
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:45,720
I loved him.

303
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:50,725
Well, I needed this address,
so I went to The The Trattoria.

304
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,894
I met some of your relations.

305
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:56,272
Keep walking.

306
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:01,402
So who'd you meet? Nice Uncle Vito?

307
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:05,073
Full name: Vito Graziosi.
That ring any bells?

308
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,075
Was it boxing?

309
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:11,621
Vito "The Butcher" Graziosi.
He's the head of the Graziosi crime family.

310
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,289
Did you meet Johnny?

311
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:17,710
Johnny Graziosi just finished eight years
in Sing Sing for loansharking.

312
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,045
Vinnie?

313
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:23,257
Vinnie "The Shrimp" D'Agostino!
Twenty years for double murder!

314
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,385
Do you get the picture?

315
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:27,804
I don't understand. Are you saying...

316
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:30,556
...your dad's some kind of Mob caterer?

317
00:22:31,891 --> 00:22:35,603
My father was in prison
till I was eight, Michael.

318
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,189
He's one of them.

319
00:22:45,446 --> 00:22:46,489
Wow.

320
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,952
Just keep walking.

321
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,667
I should've told you months ago
or just walked away.

322
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:01,504
Normally I would have,
but I couldn't because I was so happy.

323
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,881
Listen. I don't want to marry your father.

324
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:08,136
But you will, Michael, whether you like it
or not. Him and his friends.

325
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:10,555
I can't let that happen, because I love you.

326
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:13,349
Everything they touch ends up spoiled
and corrupted.

327
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:18,354
Wait a minute! This is ridiculous.
For a start, I might not be corruptible.

328
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:22,024
It's a little favor,
a tiny lie and you're theirs.

329
00:23:22,775 --> 00:23:24,485
Believe me, I've seen it.

330
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,654
No, I'm sorry.

331
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,323
It's just over, Michael.

332
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,287
Well, no.

333
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,668
I've waited all my life to find someone
I love as much as I love you.

334
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:45,673
And I'm just not gonna let this
or anyone come between us.

335
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,927
Not Vito "The Butcher"
or Vinnie "The Baker"...

336
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:54,307
...or anyone involved in any kind
of food preparation. End of story.

337
00:23:54,515 --> 00:23:56,392
But you don't know how clever they are.

338
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:00,605
You do, presumably, and you can tell me.
We can do this together.

339
00:24:03,774 --> 00:24:05,318
Completely together?

340
00:24:05,568 --> 00:24:07,695
Completely. I swear.

341
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:10,907
Now just give in.

342
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,284
Marry me.

343
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,789
Yes.

344
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:25,922
Smile, you're engaged!

345
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:30,051
Great. Now just Gina and Michael.
Over here, I think--

346
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:32,470
Happy engagement, you guys!

347
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:35,139
-How's this?
-Okay, say "cheese."

348
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:36,182
Cheese!

349
00:24:36,265 --> 00:24:38,726
You're right, he really does talk funny.

350
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:41,395
Carol, you're really getting into this.

351
00:24:41,604 --> 00:24:46,484
I know. My therapist suggested it
as a way to get over my little blip.

352
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:51,447
I think it's really working.
I feel terrific, especially tonight.

353
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:54,659
I am so happy for you guys!

354
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:56,327
Excuse me.

355
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:01,749
Bad breakup. Long story.

356
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,628
Let's go say hello to Uncle Vito. Come on.

357
00:25:06,295 --> 00:25:07,713
Here we go.

358
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,685
Hey, Uncle Vito!

359
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,772
Don't you look beautiful!

360
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:31,028
Always so beautiful. You're like a flower.

361
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:32,947
Well, you too, Uncle Vito.

362
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:35,992
This is so nice.
We planned something much smaller.

363
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,368
Yes, thank you.

364
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:40,955
Your school....

365
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,623
How is everything?

366
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,544
It's pretty good.
Only two shootings last week.

367
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,587
It's got me sick with worry.

368
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:50,881
Why do you want to worry your father?

369
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,094
You want to transfer? I have a friend
of a friend in the supervisor's office.

370
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:57,304
Thank you. I'll let you know.

371
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,188
Are your family coming over
for the wedding?

372
00:26:06,313 --> 00:26:07,148
No.

373
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,399
Michael's an orphan.

374
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:09,608
He was.

375
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,571
I'm sorry to hear that.

376
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:17,658
Tell me, Michael, I'm interested to know...

377
00:26:18,033 --> 00:26:20,202
...coming from a foreign culture...

378
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:24,039
...you must have a different perspective
on all these killings.

379
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,218
To speak honestly,
I can't say I really approve...

380
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:39,638
...but my understanding is
that it's all part of your business...

381
00:26:39,722 --> 00:26:44,393
...and that people only get killed
who bring it on themselves.

382
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:50,357
The killings at Gina's high school.

383
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:56,363
I'm against them.

384
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,995
What do you say we show him
around the house a little?

385
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:12,755
$250,000. You think it's worth that?

386
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:16,008
Like I say, that's the great thing
about an auction.

387
00:27:16,091 --> 00:27:19,595
An object is worth
whatever anyone is willing to pay for it.

388
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:22,389
That's an interesting perspective.

389
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,186
Tell me what you think of this one.

390
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:32,107
You like it?

391
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:38,948
It's very...

392
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:41,325
...intriguing, isn't it?

393
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:43,118
Tell me, why does...

394
00:27:43,702 --> 00:27:45,579
...Jesus have a machine gun?

395
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:50,751
It's symbolic. You have to ask Johnny.
He does them as part of his therapy.

396
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:54,880
You have a very gifted son, Vito.
No two ways about it.

397
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,258
Well, I must say, I like the way...

398
00:27:57,508 --> 00:28:01,095
-...the blood oozes out of his cranium.
-I like that.

399
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:05,975
He's very talented, wouldn't you say?

400
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,519
Yes, I think he certainly has something.

401
00:28:11,063 --> 00:28:13,232
I'm flattered that you like it.

402
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:17,444
Listen, Michael. We should talk.

403
00:28:17,736 --> 00:28:20,447
I have friends in various fields...

404
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:23,993
...that would be delighted
to help a friend of mine.

405
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:29,331
Well, that's extremely kind of you...

406
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:35,838
...but I've always had this silly thing about
standing on my own two feet in business.

407
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,884
I hope you understand.

408
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:48,684
Of course.

409
00:28:50,144 --> 00:28:52,146
I respect your feeling.

410
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,910
"You're nobody...

411
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,873
"...till somebody loves you"

412
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,502
I'm so proud of you.

413
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:18,797
-No. You see, I am so proud of you.
-No, you.

414
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:20,674
-No, you.
-Oh, shut up!

415
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:21,967
All right.

416
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,762
Perfect!

417
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,515
I am so happy for you.

418
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:30,851
One more!

419
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,064
"Somebody to love. "

420
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,875
Talk to Helen about tonight's catalog.

421
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:58,086
Rent GoodFellas, Casino,
Godfa ther l, ll, Ill....

422
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:03,467
Excuse me. Can I help you?

423
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:07,054
How much is this one?

424
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:11,099
On this, the reserve is $30,000, I think.

425
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:16,688
That being, of course,
the opening bid on tonight's auction.

426
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:20,984
Do you have much experience
when it comes to buying art?

427
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:22,236
No.

428
00:30:22,444 --> 00:30:25,614
But I hear it can be a good investment.

429
00:30:26,448 --> 00:30:27,407
Yes.

430
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:29,243
My father...

431
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:31,286
...recently died...

432
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:35,040
...and left me some money.

433
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:36,500
Your father?

434
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,919
That must've been a terrible shock.

435
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:43,423
If you're looking for something beautiful
to put on your wall...

436
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:46,093
...you might like to think about a mirror.

437
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,557
Oh, you!

438
00:30:51,848 --> 00:30:54,476
I really want a painting.

439
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:58,272
-Can I have a word?
-One moment.

440
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:03,402
Tonight, if there's a nice painting
going for less than it's really worth...

441
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,613
...perhaps I could let you know about it.

442
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:08,782
You mean like a signal?

443
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:10,158
Exactly.

444
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:13,495
I have an important potential client
I have to talk to.

445
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,249
I'll leave Helen here to work out
the exact details of this with you.

446
00:31:17,332 --> 00:31:19,126
-Where is he?
-Not here yet.

447
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:21,378
But the trucks are.

448
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,380
That means they're early.

449
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:24,798
Incredible, huh?

450
00:31:25,507 --> 00:31:26,883
Fantastic!

451
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,054
Hello.

452
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:32,472
What?

453
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:42,024
-So that's everything.
-Yes, sir. All 44 pieces.

454
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:45,402
I just want you to know,
if I've said anything...

455
00:31:45,485 --> 00:31:49,072
...or done anything in the past
that in any way offended you...

456
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:51,575
...l'm very deeply sorry.

457
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:56,163
Thanks.

458
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,384
-Are you okay?
-Sorry.

459
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:12,220
Yes, I'm fine. I was just....

460
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:16,433
The delivery was complete and on time.
It was a bit of a shock.

461
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:17,684
I can imagine.

462
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,478
Morganson's here.

463
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:23,732
I thought you could soften him up a bit,
then I'll move in for the kill.

464
00:32:24,357 --> 00:32:25,484
Absolutely.

465
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:26,568
Lovely.

466
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:28,820
We do like to think we can...

467
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:32,699
...match Sotheby's in the two qualities
most important to any auction house.

468
00:32:32,783 --> 00:32:36,203
One being, obviously,
a tradition of unquestioned respectability.

469
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:39,748
And the other being,
for want of a better word...

470
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:42,292
...shall we say, "class."

471
00:32:49,883 --> 00:32:52,260
I know Mr. Cromwell
is anxious to talk to you.

472
00:32:58,225 --> 00:33:00,769
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
What's the problem?

473
00:33:00,852 --> 00:33:04,481
Mr. Graziosi wants me
to auction it for $50,000.

474
00:33:04,898 --> 00:33:08,860
People would pay $50,000 just to avoid
being in the same room as this thing.

475
00:33:08,944 --> 00:33:09,903
Michael, please.

476
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:14,032
Your trucks show up on time
for the first time in God knows how long.

477
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:17,661
And you get to give a little happiness
to an important friend.

478
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:20,205
What's the matter?
I thought you'd be happy.

479
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:21,540
No. Mr. Vitale--

480
00:33:21,623 --> 00:33:22,624
No, Dad.

481
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:26,086
You don't understand. This is exactly
what Gina said would happen.

482
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:29,798
If she even found out
that this thing had been sent over here--

483
00:33:30,465 --> 00:33:31,758
You're early.

484
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:33,593
Just on the phone with your dad.

485
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:35,053
Let me talk.

486
00:33:39,307 --> 00:33:40,684
You got my message?

487
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:43,353
Great. And everything's okay
for tomorrow?

488
00:33:44,187 --> 00:33:46,898
And tomorrow at noon
is okay for the fittings?

489
00:33:47,274 --> 00:33:49,985
Well, here's the deal. I'm gonna be there...

490
00:33:50,193 --> 00:33:53,363
...and Carol's gonna come along too,
to take photos.

491
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,575
She's doing the whole wedding, so be nice.

492
00:33:57,993 --> 00:34:00,620
We have to talk
about the wedding reception.

493
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:05,083
Now, I know you and Mom used Louie's--

494
00:34:07,794 --> 00:34:08,795
Hold on.

495
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:18,722
We have two key attributes for which,
in this business, there is no substitute.

496
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,892
The first being, obviously,
a tradition of unparalleled respectability.

497
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:26,521
And the other being, shall we say,
for want of a better word--

498
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:32,360
We'll come back later.

499
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:36,323
Right. Fine.

500
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:38,283
Daddy, we have to go.

501
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:39,826
I love you too.

502
00:34:41,328 --> 00:34:42,954
He wants to say 'bye.

503
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:47,667
It's gonna be okay.

504
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:51,796
You put the thing up for auction.
It don't sell, Gina will never know.

505
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:53,882
I don't think I can do that.

506
00:34:55,842 --> 00:35:00,513
Listen, this favor....
If you don't do it, it's really not that great.

507
00:35:00,722 --> 00:35:03,475
Not for you, and to be honest with you,
not for me.

508
00:35:03,558 --> 00:35:06,436
So just do it this once,
and I'll talk to Vito...

509
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:11,066
...and explain how in the future
you two would prefer to go it alone, okay?

510
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:13,818
Is that a promise, Dad?

511
00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:15,320
That's a promise.

512
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:21,159
Fabulous. Noon tomorrow then it is.
Okay, 'bye.

513
00:35:22,243 --> 00:35:23,912
What is wrong with you?

514
00:35:25,038 --> 00:35:26,790
You, come here!

515
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:35,840
I swear to God, Frankie,
I ain't got the money!

516
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:39,177
Now I gotta put you on mountain climb.

517
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:55,568
-We worked out the signals.
-What?

518
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,445
With the old lady.

519
00:35:57,904 --> 00:36:00,323
If you want her to start bidding, you cough.

520
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:01,366
Easy enough.

521
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:04,536
If you want her to stop bidding,
you just say "ha."

522
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:07,580
Fine. What? Say what?

523
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:09,040
Ha!

524
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:16,005
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

525
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:19,217
And welcome to
"Portraiture: 1450 to 1750. "

526
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:31,187
And down it goes, then...

527
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:34,858
...at $25,000 to bidder number 977.

528
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:39,279
And so to our final piece of the evening...

529
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:43,908
...and a last-minute addition
to your catalog...

530
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:46,786
...lot number 277A...

531
00:36:46,995 --> 00:36:50,331
...oil on canvas, signed by the artist:

532
00:36:50,623 --> 00:36:54,586
The Road To Damascus
by Jonathan Graziosi.

533
00:36:56,212 --> 00:36:57,505
This item...

534
00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:01,092
...has a reserve of $50,000.
$50,000, anyone?

535
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:02,677
No.

536
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,305
Well, too bad. Thank you very much.

537
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:07,765
That concludes the business for--

538
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:10,685
Was that....

539
00:37:14,814 --> 00:37:17,108
We have $50,000.

540
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:20,820
$50,000.

541
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:23,531
$55,000, anyone?

542
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,452
All through. All done, then...

543
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,331
...at $50,000 to bidder number 235.

544
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:35,084
I believe that's a record for a Graziosi.

545
00:37:35,168 --> 00:37:38,921
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen, and good night.

546
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:49,182
You snuck that last one in on me,
didn't you?

547
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,434
Yes, I'm afraid so. I'm sorry.

548
00:37:51,517 --> 00:37:53,186
Do that more often.

549
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:57,023
Congratulations. Quite a painting
you have for yourself, sir.

550
00:37:57,398 --> 00:37:59,150
Thank you. I appreciate that.

551
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:02,195
I'm sorry. Have we met somewhere?

552
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,988
I don't believe so.

553
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:06,949
But may I ask,
do either of you enjoy steak?

554
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:08,534
Very much so.

555
00:38:09,035 --> 00:38:11,913
University and 9th. I'm very proud of it.

556
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,965
You make me very proud
and Johnny very happy.

557
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:26,511
There's something going on here!

558
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:30,014
-Nothing's going on.
-I don't like your face.

559
00:38:36,854 --> 00:38:39,649
Frank? I've been trying
to get you since last night.

560
00:38:39,732 --> 00:38:43,444
Listen, it sold. Did you know
that the painting actually sold?

561
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:45,822
Right on. I heard. That's great.

562
00:38:46,155 --> 00:38:48,658
Did you talk to your friend?

563
00:38:48,866 --> 00:38:51,536
That is it, right? Finito, no more favors.

564
00:38:51,744 --> 00:38:52,995
Trust me, Michael.

565
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,123
-It's gonna be okay.
-Great.

566
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:58,960
Wait. Wait. Sorry.
It is, or it's going to be?

567
00:38:59,085 --> 00:39:00,545
Hello?

568
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:03,089
Sorry, gotta go. See you at the tailor.

569
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:12,140
Excuse me. What's going on?

570
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:14,308
Big fire over on 72nd Street.

571
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,018
A restaurant or something?

572
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:17,395
Some art place.

573
00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:21,274
Sotheby's?

574
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:22,859
That's it.

575
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:59,103
There are some men here
to see you from the FBl.

576
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:03,316
Good.

577
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,318
Good, good.

578
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:11,282
We often sell works by first-time artists.

579
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,701
I don't see how this time is any different.

580
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:17,079
The difference is this painting was bought
by a restaurant owner...

581
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:20,041
...who owed the artist's father $50,000.

582
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:23,377
It's a setup.
They bought it from themselves.

583
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:27,924
I don't understand. Someone buys your
painting for $50,000, you make $50,000.

584
00:40:28,174 --> 00:40:30,551
But if they owed you the money,
you make nothing.

585
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:32,595
It's called money laundering.

586
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:35,306
You mind?

587
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:36,974
Not at all, no.

588
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,145
They do it through car washes,
restaurants...

589
00:40:41,228 --> 00:40:43,856
...bars and, last night, through you.

590
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:46,692
Have you at any time come into contact...

591
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,237
...with anyone who might be connected
with organized crime?

592
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,493
Absolutely not.

593
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,704
You sure about that?

594
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:01,415
I am positive.

595
00:41:22,144 --> 00:41:23,813
Are we okay to see Michael?

596
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:26,273
He's in with the FBl.

597
00:41:27,566 --> 00:41:28,651
Lovely.

598
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:31,070
Perhaps later, then.

599
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,030
Have you had lunch?

600
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:40,162
Thank you very much for the warning.

601
00:41:40,246 --> 00:41:43,749
If anything like this crops up again,
I'll certainly be in touch.

602
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,501
We'd appreciate that.

603
00:41:45,584 --> 00:41:48,295
We're dealing with something
pretty ugly here.

604
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:50,464
Here's my card.

605
00:41:51,424 --> 00:41:52,341
Thank you.

606
00:41:52,425 --> 00:41:54,135
Oh, those. Thank you.

607
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,765
Gina is in reception.

608
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:01,600
Good. Thank you.

609
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:06,147
I know what you're thinking.
It's okay. Relax.

610
00:42:06,897 --> 00:42:08,274
Mr. Felgate.

611
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:10,234
Where did you want this?

612
00:42:15,156 --> 00:42:17,741
In my office. Thank you. Quick as you can.

613
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,795
Vito and Johnny are taking more
of a liking to the idea...

614
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:33,090
...than any of us had perhaps
originally anticipated.

615
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:36,260
My God! It's out of control!
You can't control it!

616
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,971
Listen now. It is not out of control.

617
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:41,056
I have to tell Gina.

618
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:44,810
Tonight is your last auction
of the season, right?

619
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:47,104
Just keep Gina away from there.

620
00:42:47,188 --> 00:42:49,106
Sell the painting, go on your honeymoon.

621
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:52,151
When you come back,
everything will be taken care of.

622
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:55,404
I am not lying to Gina. I have to tell her.

623
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:56,989
Michael, please.

624
00:42:57,072 --> 00:43:01,327
Gina's happiness means more to me than
anything in the world. You know that.

625
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:05,414
If you tell her now that you already lied...

626
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:07,249
...it's all over.

627
00:43:14,673 --> 00:43:16,717
Goddamn it!

628
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:20,346
This is your fault!

629
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:23,682
You know, I've been on your side
every step of the way.

630
00:43:23,891 --> 00:43:27,394
If you were a plumber,
would we be having this conversation?

631
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:35,653
Look at you!

632
00:43:35,861 --> 00:43:37,613
Wait. Where's Ritchie?

633
00:43:41,742 --> 00:43:42,743
Smile!

634
00:43:44,995 --> 00:43:46,455
What's the matter with you?

635
00:43:46,538 --> 00:43:47,831
I don't know.

636
00:43:48,082 --> 00:43:50,709
So, are you guys busy tonight?

637
00:43:51,085 --> 00:43:54,797
Actually, I'm gonna go to Michael's
big auction. You wanna come?

638
00:43:55,297 --> 00:43:56,298
Yes.

639
00:43:57,132 --> 00:43:58,926
We should talk about that.

640
00:43:59,218 --> 00:44:00,135
What?

641
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,390
Tonight. I've been thinking about it.
You know, it's quite a big deal.

642
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:07,142
Morganson's gonna be there again...

643
00:44:08,143 --> 00:44:11,605
...and I'm just afraid I might get put off
if you were there.

644
00:44:12,022 --> 00:44:14,274
I know it sounds silly.

645
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:18,612
I just might not be able to see the bids
because I'd, you know...

646
00:44:19,738 --> 00:44:22,324
...not be able to look at you.

647
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:26,829
What? What is it?

648
00:44:27,204 --> 00:44:28,706
What is it?

649
00:44:29,248 --> 00:44:30,916
I'm fine.

650
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:33,210
Just, he....

651
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:39,383
He loves you so much,
and I am so happy for you.

652
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:47,516
No, it's so great.

653
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,478
It's so good.

654
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:12,207
And so, finally, to lot 125A.

655
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:15,836
And another of our occasional
Jonathan Graziosi's.

656
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,131
This unusual painting is entitled:

657
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:21,049
Die, Piggy-Piggy, Die, Die...

658
00:45:21,133 --> 00:45:23,635
...and has a reserve of $80,000.

659
00:45:24,761 --> 00:45:26,930
At $80,000, then.

660
00:45:29,266 --> 00:45:30,267
Anyone?

661
00:45:32,311 --> 00:45:33,645
Bid.

662
00:45:33,854 --> 00:45:35,272
$80,000.

663
00:45:44,031 --> 00:45:45,115
Excuse me.

664
00:45:48,493 --> 00:45:49,661
Is that...?

665
00:45:51,455 --> 00:45:52,581
We have...

666
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,043
...$80,000, lady at the front.

667
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,713
$85,000, anyone?

668
00:46:02,674 --> 00:46:07,054
$85,000, gentleman at the back.
No advance. No one else. All through--

669
00:46:09,014 --> 00:46:11,433
$90,000.

670
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:13,894
$90,000.

671
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:15,812
Ha!

672
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,106
Anyone at $95,000?

673
00:46:18,357 --> 00:46:20,651
Be smart, take her money.
Let me pay you later!

674
00:46:20,776 --> 00:46:22,986
You're supposed to buy the painting.

675
00:46:23,111 --> 00:46:26,281
-But you can make double the money!
-Just doing my job.

676
00:46:26,365 --> 00:46:28,575
Yes, $95,000. Ha!

677
00:46:31,036 --> 00:46:33,330
$100,000.

678
00:46:33,997 --> 00:46:36,249
Anyone at $105,000?

679
00:46:38,126 --> 00:46:40,712
$105,000, gentleman at the back.

680
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:43,548
May I remind you,
we recently sold a Graziosi...

681
00:46:43,632 --> 00:46:47,094
...for a record $50,000,
the most ever paid for a Graziosi.

682
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:51,390
$50,000, less than, ha, half
the current bidding price.

683
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:56,311
$110,000.

684
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,647
Anyone at $115?

685
00:47:01,149 --> 00:47:02,234
Sir?

686
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:04,403
$115?

687
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:06,113
I told you.

688
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:11,743
Certainly, to let this go for $110,000 would
be a crime of the greatest magnitude.

689
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,917
Yes! $115,000, gentleman at the back.

690
00:47:19,126 --> 00:47:22,629
All done, and down it goes at $115,000
to bidder number 702.

691
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:26,967
That brings us to the end of the auction.
Thank you. Good night.

692
00:47:31,012 --> 00:47:33,140
I can't talk. I have to see Gina.

693
00:47:42,065 --> 00:47:45,235
Gina told me the happy news.
I'm baking you two a cake.

694
00:47:46,486 --> 00:47:48,238
That's incredibly nice of you.

695
00:47:48,363 --> 00:47:50,365
I'll see you a bit later, then.

696
00:48:12,137 --> 00:48:13,972
Who are you? What is this?

697
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:17,517
It's the three-month anniversary
of our very first date.

698
00:48:17,851 --> 00:48:19,561
I'm a complete...

699
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:21,605
...idiot. Sorry.

700
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:23,523
But do you mind company?

701
00:48:23,732 --> 00:48:24,524
Who?

702
00:48:28,987 --> 00:48:31,531
Humans and gorillas are primates.

703
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:33,909
-He reminded me of you.
-He would.

704
00:48:33,992 --> 00:48:35,827
Happy anniversary.

705
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:41,082
My God. I feel so horrible that
I didn't remember to get anything for you.

706
00:48:42,709 --> 00:48:44,169
Oh, my God!

707
00:48:45,253 --> 00:48:46,171
Swap?

708
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,007
You can't afford this!

709
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:51,885
Come here.

710
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:57,140
I have an opposable thumb.

711
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,600
Gina, hang on.

712
00:48:58,683 --> 00:49:00,727
Calm down. Calm down.

713
00:49:00,936 --> 00:49:03,813
Listen, I can afford it, because, you know...

714
00:49:04,022 --> 00:49:07,275
...things have been going really well
at work recently.

715
00:49:07,525 --> 00:49:08,735
Apart from...

716
00:49:12,405 --> 00:49:16,910
...this one thing that I think
we should talk about, okay?

717
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:25,502
I'll go.

718
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:34,177
Who is it?

719
00:49:36,429 --> 00:49:39,474
It's Jehovah bloody Witnesses.

720
00:49:39,766 --> 00:49:42,644
Please go away. Thank you.
We're not interested.

721
00:49:44,854 --> 00:49:46,648
They must be very devoted.

722
00:49:46,815 --> 00:49:47,816
Hang on.

723
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:49,025
Excuse me.

724
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:51,569
I want my money now.

725
00:49:51,778 --> 00:49:56,116
-I can't talk about this now.
-No talk. Money. Now!

726
00:49:58,118 --> 00:49:59,077
Hello, Gina.

727
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:01,287
Michael, what's going on?

728
00:50:01,538 --> 00:50:04,916
Prince Charles here just cost me $130,000.

729
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:08,837
And he's gonna make it up
out of his own pocket. What's this worth?

730
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,881
They were auctioning Johnny's paintings
to launder money.

731
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:13,008
Not "they."

732
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:14,009
"We."

733
00:50:14,217 --> 00:50:17,554
And a connoisseur had the taste
to try to buy some of my art.

734
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,432
She was 90 years old and blind.
She wasn't a connoisseur.

735
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:23,435
Your jerk fiancÃ© wouldn't even let her bid.

736
00:50:23,601 --> 00:50:26,229
Cheating innocent collectors
wasn't part of the deal!

737
00:50:26,312 --> 00:50:27,605
You had a deal?

738
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:29,065
No. No.

739
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,651
When angered, I make this sound....

740
00:50:32,193 --> 00:50:35,947
Then how come you took commission
from the painting I sold last night?

741
00:50:36,072 --> 00:50:38,366
This is why you told me
not to come tonight.

742
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,494
Because if I was there,
you'd have trouble not looking at me.

743
00:50:41,578 --> 00:50:43,413
Very smooth. Very smooth.

744
00:50:43,496 --> 00:50:46,291
Did you take a commission?
ls that how you afforded this?

745
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:49,043
We burst your little
Town & Country bubble here?

746
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:50,879
I don't know who you think you are--

747
00:50:50,962 --> 00:50:53,006
-That's it! Get out.
-Don't touch me!

748
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:54,716
All right. All right.

749
00:50:54,799 --> 00:50:56,885
Other primates fear the gorilla.

750
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:58,803
Don't be a moron, Johnny.

751
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:02,182
Just relax, okay? Relax.

752
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:05,143
Come on, Johnny. You don't need the gun.

753
00:51:05,977 --> 00:51:07,729
You're right. I don't.

754
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:14,778
I hate to do this
to such a beautiful establishment...

755
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:17,155
...but you gotta learn how to pay up!

756
00:51:18,323 --> 00:51:19,240
Stop.

757
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,826
Stop!

758
00:51:27,999 --> 00:51:30,668
My diet is leaves and fresh fruit.

759
00:51:31,211 --> 00:51:32,337
Oh, my God!

760
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:35,215
What happened? Did it ricochet?

761
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:39,844
He's dead.

762
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,600
Oh, my God! Oh, my God....

763
00:51:46,893 --> 00:51:48,937
It's not your fault. It's okay.

764
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,065
Here's what we'll do.
I'm gonna call the police.

765
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:54,526
You can't.

766
00:51:54,734 --> 00:51:56,819
They own half the police.

767
00:51:57,946 --> 00:51:59,030
What have I done?

768
00:51:59,113 --> 00:52:00,532
Don't you worry.

769
00:52:00,823 --> 00:52:03,451
-You go home. I'll call your father.
-Daddy?

770
00:52:03,576 --> 00:52:05,161
We can deal with this.

771
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,206
You're one of the guys now.

772
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:10,583
Gina, listen to me. That's not true.

773
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:13,711
No, you're right. This is a job for the boys.

774
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:16,089
-You don't understand.
-Don't touch me!

775
00:52:16,172 --> 00:52:19,551
I do. I understand perfectly.
I've always understood.

776
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:24,347
That's why I warned you. That's why
you swore to me this wouldn't happen.

777
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:25,848
Let me explain!

778
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:28,601
-I'll just put this in the kitchen.
-No!

779
00:52:29,435 --> 00:52:33,273
No, thank you. Thank you so much,
but I just learned I'm diabetic.

780
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:36,067
Thank you so much
for the thought, though.

781
00:52:48,663 --> 00:52:50,832
Funny how life imitates art.

782
00:52:53,251 --> 00:52:54,836
All right.

783
00:52:55,378 --> 00:52:58,089
Don't worry. We can handle this.

784
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,633
It's gonna be okay.

785
00:53:02,427 --> 00:53:06,514
First thing, do you have any plastic bags?

786
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,391
Absolutely.

787
00:53:12,603 --> 00:53:15,273
Jesus. Sweet Jesus.

788
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:17,400
Here.

789
00:53:19,944 --> 00:53:22,113
What am I supposed to do with that?

790
00:53:22,947 --> 00:53:24,282
I don't know.

791
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:26,284
I thought perhaps...

792
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:27,827
...the gun?

793
00:53:31,205 --> 00:53:32,790
Bigger? Right.

794
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,300
Sorry! Sorry!

795
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,053
The trick is to hook up under the armpits.

796
00:53:51,017 --> 00:53:52,769
Good evening again, Mrs. Horton.

797
00:53:52,894 --> 00:53:56,272
Just getting rid of all the food with sugar.

798
00:53:59,442 --> 00:54:00,735
Don't push.

799
00:55:01,295 --> 00:55:02,463
Shit!

800
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:17,562
-Would you stay down?
-I am down!

801
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:19,939
Frankie?

802
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:22,692
Al?

803
00:55:22,984 --> 00:55:23,985
It's Frankie.

804
00:55:24,068 --> 00:55:25,486
Vitale?

805
00:55:26,904 --> 00:55:27,947
It's Al.

806
00:55:32,118 --> 00:55:33,619
Unbelievable.

807
00:55:35,162 --> 00:55:36,831
My God, Sante.

808
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:38,249
Did you get hit?

809
00:55:38,332 --> 00:55:40,793
Are you kidding?
Thank God we're chickenshits!

810
00:55:40,876 --> 00:55:43,671
Real tough guys would've stood there
and aimed.

811
00:55:44,213 --> 00:55:46,674
So who's your friend?

812
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,721
That's Big Mickey from Kansas City.
Friend of ours.

813
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,931
I thought Big Mickey was dead.

814
00:55:54,557 --> 00:55:56,559
The father. This is Little Big Mickey.

815
00:55:56,642 --> 00:55:59,270
Wasn't there a Little Big Mickey
out of Chicago?

816
00:55:59,353 --> 00:56:03,065
That's the original Little Big Mickey.
This is Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes.

817
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:05,151
So you work for Tony Two-Tone.

818
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:11,365
Who you got over there?
ls that Sonny Marsalino?

819
00:56:11,449 --> 00:56:13,117
Wasn't he in witness protection?

820
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,037
Took us seven years.
Tracked him and whacked him.

821
00:56:16,871 --> 00:56:18,873
"Tracked him and whacked him."

822
00:56:18,956 --> 00:56:20,750
So who's your guy?

823
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:23,085
He's a nobody.

824
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:25,880
Frankie, come on. We showed you ours.

825
00:56:26,047 --> 00:56:28,049
What? We in the second grade?

826
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:31,177
He's a witness. I really can't talk about it.

827
00:56:31,886 --> 00:56:34,138
Then we should get these guys
in the ground.

828
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:35,639
Good. Good to see you.

829
00:56:35,723 --> 00:56:36,974
You too.

830
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,226
God bless. Take care.

831
00:56:40,936 --> 00:56:42,688
Let's go. We gotta move him.

832
00:56:42,772 --> 00:56:44,774
-Oh, my God.
-Come on. Come on!

833
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:48,694
-I gotta dig?
-You dig. It's your turn.

834
00:56:48,778 --> 00:56:51,363
-You shot him.
-So? I whacked him, you dig.

835
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:55,284
You know what? I wish I was him.

836
00:56:55,493 --> 00:56:56,744
No, you don't.

837
00:56:56,911 --> 00:56:59,080
You're right. I wish you were him.

838
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:03,459
Here, here, here, here.

839
00:57:03,876 --> 00:57:05,252
Wipe yourself.

840
00:57:08,422 --> 00:57:10,841
-You got a $100 bill?
-Why?

841
00:57:11,092 --> 00:57:13,344
Get in the car. Don't worry about it.

842
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:15,638
Look, one thing....

843
00:57:16,472 --> 00:57:18,474
If any of this gets out...

844
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,477
...l'm the one that shot Johnny, okay?

845
00:57:21,936 --> 00:57:23,938
Can we at least agree on that?

846
00:57:25,898 --> 00:57:27,399
You got it.

847
00:57:36,283 --> 00:57:37,618
You all right?

848
00:57:38,202 --> 00:57:39,787
You got my messages?

849
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:44,458
You buried him and then you dug him up.

850
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,169
And now you don't know where he is.

851
00:57:48,295 --> 00:57:49,630
No, not exactly.

852
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:51,924
Yeah, I got your messages.

853
00:57:55,678 --> 00:57:57,096
How're you feeling?

854
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:01,141
Obviously, it's my first murder.

855
00:58:01,433 --> 00:58:05,479
On top of which, I feel like I'm going crazy,
and I'm scared.

856
00:58:05,688 --> 00:58:07,731
And the one person I wanna turn to...

857
00:58:07,815 --> 00:58:10,484
...turns out to be a liar and a fraud.

858
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:12,319
Other than that--

859
00:58:12,403 --> 00:58:13,654
I'm not a liar.

860
00:58:13,737 --> 00:58:15,990
Yes, I am a liar.

861
00:58:16,156 --> 00:58:17,449
Just let me--

862
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:21,745
I don't think I can. I'm sorry. I have to go.

863
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:23,038
Wait.

864
00:58:24,248 --> 00:58:25,833
Hold out your hand.

865
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:29,003
Here.

866
00:58:29,336 --> 00:58:33,215
Just hang on to it
till I've had a chance to explain.

867
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:40,806
Come over for lunch tomorrow
and I'll listen to what you have to say.

868
00:58:44,977 --> 00:58:47,980
This is Patrick Richards
reporting from Central Park...

869
00:58:48,022 --> 00:58:52,401
...where police found the body
of 31-year-old Jonathan Graziosi...

870
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,529
...son of reputed Mob boss Vito Graziosi.

871
00:58:56,238 --> 00:59:00,868
Sources tell us the body was found
with a rolled-up $100 bill in one nostril...

872
00:59:01,076 --> 00:59:04,371
...calling card of the notorious
Risolli crime family.

873
00:59:04,538 --> 00:59:07,750
Johnny was at the beginning
of a flourishing art career.

874
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:37,863
Tony Risolli called. They wanna talk.

875
00:59:39,114 --> 00:59:41,200
Okay. Set it up.

876
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,041
As soon as they pull up,
we should blow them away.

877
00:59:51,668 --> 00:59:54,004
Let's listen to what they got to say.

878
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:20,948
Mr. Risolli says he swears
on the soul of his mother...

879
01:00:21,156 --> 01:00:23,325
...he had nothing to do with this.

880
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,660
Then who?

881
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,877
A cop in the 20th precinct tipped us.

882
01:00:33,961 --> 01:00:38,132
They towed Johnny's car from a building
on the Upper West Side.

883
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:40,801
That's the address.

884
01:00:44,012 --> 01:00:45,013
Go.

885
01:00:46,181 --> 01:00:47,307
No, wait.

886
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:54,523
You don't want everyone stomping around
up there, scaring people away.

887
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:58,694
How about I go in there
with a detective's badge?

888
01:00:58,777 --> 01:01:01,154
You know, ask around. Keep it quiet.

889
01:01:01,947 --> 01:01:04,908
We find the right zebra,
we tear him to pieces.

890
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:24,803
Tickle my tummy!

891
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:46,491
Which apartment was the old lady in
that saw us with Johnny?

892
01:01:46,867 --> 01:01:48,076
Why?

893
01:01:50,412 --> 01:01:52,039
They know he was here.

894
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:55,083
We need to talk to her about it.

895
01:02:03,634 --> 01:02:05,636
What's that? What are you gonna do?

896
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:07,888
Please. I am not gonna hurt her.

897
01:02:08,055 --> 01:02:09,348
-No, Listen--
-You can't--

898
01:02:09,473 --> 01:02:12,309
-If we don't do this, we'll both die.
-Who is it?

899
01:02:12,726 --> 01:02:15,395
Michael Felgate
and his harmless friend Frank.

900
01:02:15,562 --> 01:02:17,397
Mrs. Horton, do not open--

901
01:02:17,648 --> 01:02:18,440
What?

902
01:02:18,565 --> 01:02:21,234
Mrs. Horton, he said,
"Please open the door."

903
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,529
You're Michael's friend?
The garbage helper?

904
01:02:24,905 --> 01:02:26,782
Yes, the garbage helper.

905
01:02:27,366 --> 01:02:28,867
Would you stop it?

906
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:40,212
What are you guys doing here?

907
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:43,131
Mr. Risolli thought we should check it out.

908
01:02:44,383 --> 01:02:46,093
Hey, Mickey Blue!

909
01:02:47,386 --> 01:02:48,929
Thank you very much.

910
01:02:49,054 --> 01:02:52,099
If you remember anything else,
call that number.

911
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:57,729
We covered this place,
but most of the people are at work.

912
01:02:57,938 --> 01:03:02,067
How about we grab some steak,
we all come back later this afternoon?

913
01:03:02,275 --> 01:03:04,778
We look like we ever said no to a steak?

914
01:03:04,986 --> 01:03:06,822
And I got the perfect place.

915
01:03:06,905 --> 01:03:08,156
You'll love it, Frank.

916
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,658
Follow us.

917
01:03:21,002 --> 01:03:22,796
Hey. Forget about it!

918
01:03:23,004 --> 01:03:25,006
"Hey. Forget about it."

919
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:28,009
"Forget about it." No R's.

920
01:03:28,301 --> 01:03:29,928
"Forget about it."

921
01:03:30,095 --> 01:03:31,847
Now change the T's to D's.

922
01:03:31,972 --> 01:03:33,598
"Forget about it."

923
01:03:34,057 --> 01:03:34,975
"ld"?

924
01:03:35,183 --> 01:03:37,269
You said change the T's to D's!

925
01:03:37,477 --> 01:03:38,854
Not the last one.

926
01:03:38,937 --> 01:03:41,064
Change them, but not the last one.

927
01:03:41,148 --> 01:03:42,691
Wait, forget about it.

928
01:03:42,774 --> 01:03:43,692
Stop.

929
01:03:43,817 --> 01:03:45,318
Try this one here:

930
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:47,779
"Get the hell outta here." No Rs.

931
01:03:47,863 --> 01:03:49,990
"Get the hell outta here."

932
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,616
Not "hee." "Here."

933
01:03:55,996 --> 01:04:00,208
Keep your mouth shut and stick this
in your pants. Maybe you'll look the part.

934
01:04:00,292 --> 01:04:02,627
Maybe I should just shoot Mrs. Horton...

935
01:04:02,711 --> 01:04:05,297
...and save you going back with your rope.

936
01:04:05,547 --> 01:04:08,425
-You thought that was to strangle her?
-What else?

937
01:04:08,508 --> 01:04:13,013
Tie her up so I could take her to my cabin.
I mean, my God!

938
01:04:13,221 --> 01:04:15,056
What kind of person do you think I am?

939
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,852
The kind of person who knows the trick
for carrying a dead body.

940
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:21,354
Oh, my God!

941
01:04:22,147 --> 01:04:23,648
Hey, get outta here.

942
01:04:23,899 --> 01:04:26,067
-No, just forget about it.
-"Forget about it."

943
01:04:26,151 --> 01:04:28,153
No, I mean, shut up.

944
01:04:28,361 --> 01:04:30,697
Please, shut up!

945
01:04:31,031 --> 01:04:32,240
"Forget about it."

946
01:04:54,679 --> 01:04:57,933
My God! I sold him the painting.
He knows who I am.

947
01:04:58,683 --> 01:05:00,393
This can't be happening.

948
01:05:02,354 --> 01:05:04,314
You gentlemen ready to order?

949
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:09,444
Just a salad and some mineral water.
I'm counting my cholesterol.

950
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:14,532
I'll have a sirloin, medium, fried onions,
baked potato with everything on it.

951
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,368
And a beer.

952
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:17,577
Same.

953
01:05:18,411 --> 01:05:19,579
And you?

954
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,914
Same.

955
01:05:21,206 --> 01:05:23,249
How you want your steak cooked?

956
01:05:28,129 --> 01:05:29,422
Rare.

957
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:30,715
What?

958
01:05:31,549 --> 01:05:32,592
Raw.

959
01:05:32,884 --> 01:05:33,885
What?

960
01:05:34,135 --> 01:05:34,928
Raw!

961
01:05:35,136 --> 01:05:36,096
Raw?

962
01:05:38,264 --> 01:05:39,265
Rare?

963
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:40,767
Rare.

964
01:05:44,896 --> 01:05:46,564
And how about to drink?

965
01:05:48,066 --> 01:05:49,025
Beer.

966
01:05:49,234 --> 01:05:50,735
Another beer.

967
01:05:51,736 --> 01:05:53,238
You talk funny.

968
01:05:55,907 --> 01:05:58,410
You got any company
while you're in town?

969
01:06:01,413 --> 01:06:02,831
Hey, Antoinette!

970
01:06:03,081 --> 01:06:04,207
Come here.

971
01:06:07,836 --> 01:06:09,546
This here's a good friend of ours.

972
01:06:09,629 --> 01:06:11,589
Kansas City Little Big Mickey Blue Eyes.

973
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:13,508
Well, that's a mouthful.

974
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:16,344
Sit down. Say hi to the nice man.

975
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:20,098
Hi.

976
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:25,145
Mickey Blue Eyes.
Why do they call you that?

977
01:06:27,939 --> 01:06:30,191
So what part of Kansas City?

978
01:06:33,945 --> 01:06:36,781
-Are they taking care of you?
-Get back in your kitchen!

979
01:06:36,865 --> 01:06:38,700
I want something, I'll ask!

980
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,877
Kansas City, here I come.

981
01:06:49,961 --> 01:06:52,797
Rent GoodFellas, Casino,
Godfather l, ll, Ill....

982
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:54,632
Jesus Christ, it talks?

983
01:06:54,716 --> 01:06:56,593
With an accent, no less.

984
01:06:56,843 --> 01:06:58,052
What is that?

985
01:06:58,136 --> 01:07:02,015
It's like a little recorder thing.
Got it off some British asshole.

986
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:04,767
What an amazing coincidence.

987
01:07:05,518 --> 01:07:07,979
Come for one of the famous steaks?

988
01:07:09,647 --> 01:07:11,566
Is something queer going on?

989
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:15,320
Is this in any way connected
to that FBI business?

990
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:18,656
Philip, I can't explain at the moment.

991
01:07:19,032 --> 01:07:21,409
What was going on
at the auction last night?

992
01:07:21,492 --> 01:07:24,829
Why did you keep saying "ha"?
We were worried about you.

993
01:07:25,371 --> 01:07:27,207
I'll have to explain later.

994
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,585
Oh, my God! I am so sorry.

995
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:32,086
This is all my fault.

996
01:07:32,378 --> 01:07:34,130
I can't apologize enough--

997
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:38,718
Just a little screwup. But what the hell?

998
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:40,678
We got it under control.

999
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:42,305
Forget about it.

1000
01:07:43,014 --> 01:07:44,098
Why are you talking--

1001
01:07:44,182 --> 01:07:46,726
Shut up, asshole! I had enough a you!

1002
01:07:46,893 --> 01:07:49,437
I said shut up! Get outta here!

1003
01:07:49,729 --> 01:07:51,314
All you British are the same!

1004
01:07:51,397 --> 01:07:54,025
You're all assholes!
Go on! Get outta here!

1005
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:02,575
Asshole.

1006
01:08:08,164 --> 01:08:10,541
-What are they doing?
-Talking to Kansas City.

1007
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:13,753
They can't connect us to Johnny
if I get to the old lady first.

1008
01:08:13,836 --> 01:08:18,257
But she spends her afternoons
playing cards and comes home about 3:00.

1009
01:08:20,259 --> 01:08:22,387
What? What?

1010
01:08:23,304 --> 01:08:25,181
I missed meeting Gina for lunch.

1011
01:08:25,306 --> 01:08:28,685
Give her a call. Explain what happened.
It'll be okay.

1012
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:31,479
Just wake up, Frank. It will not be okay!

1013
01:08:31,562 --> 01:08:35,942
I assaulted my boss, lost my fiancÃ©e,
and your pals are going to kill me!

1014
01:08:36,401 --> 01:08:40,113
Of all the things it won't be,
"okay" pretty much tops the list.

1015
01:08:40,321 --> 01:08:41,906
You have to stay focused.

1016
01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:45,159
Focus on this. Gina won't forgive me.
Do you know why?

1017
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:49,997
I lied to her. Her father's lied
to her all her life. And it hurts.

1018
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:53,626
She told you that?

1019
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:58,339
Yeah, and now it looks like I've lost
the only girl I've ever really loved.

1020
01:08:58,548 --> 01:09:01,926
As far as I'm concerned,
it's not bloody "okay" at all.

1021
01:09:08,182 --> 01:09:09,767
You can't go home.

1022
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:12,687
I'm going to Gina's.

1023
01:09:19,694 --> 01:09:22,530
I should've told you everything
from the start.

1024
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:26,409
But the whole thing snowballed,
and before I knew where I was...

1025
01:09:26,617 --> 01:09:29,954
...l was just buried in the whole thing.

1026
01:09:30,163 --> 01:09:31,831
But everything I did...

1027
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:34,208
...l did out of fear of losing you.

1028
01:09:34,959 --> 01:09:38,379
Listen. Please just let me come up.
This is ridiculous.

1029
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:41,340
Why didn't you show up for lunch today?

1030
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:43,301
The truth, please.

1031
01:09:43,509 --> 01:09:47,221
I was with your father.
We had to have lunch with these people.

1032
01:09:47,472 --> 01:09:48,681
It was a nightmare.

1033
01:09:48,764 --> 01:09:51,851
It seems like you and Dad
are getting pretty close.

1034
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,063
What does that mean?

1035
01:09:56,522 --> 01:10:00,193
It means we're over, Michael.
I just don't know who you are.

1036
01:10:07,742 --> 01:10:09,327
You're toast.

1037
01:10:18,419 --> 01:10:20,046
-Come here.
-What?

1038
01:10:20,254 --> 01:10:21,631
Don't worry about it.

1039
01:10:21,714 --> 01:10:23,216
It'll be okay.

1040
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:27,178
Come on!

1041
01:10:28,054 --> 01:10:30,056
Thanks, Jimmy. Thanks.

1042
01:11:03,756 --> 01:11:05,716
She went out, Frankie.

1043
01:11:12,765 --> 01:11:14,600
Michael...

1044
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:18,646
...fired a warning shot in the ceiling.

1045
01:11:20,439 --> 01:11:21,899
It was an accident.

1046
01:11:23,234 --> 01:11:24,902
Sit down, Frank.

1047
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,076
Having the best time. It's a wonderful city.

1048
01:11:32,284 --> 01:11:36,455
Everyone's so courteous! I don't know
why they talk about New Yorkers--

1049
01:11:36,706 --> 01:11:38,833
Get the hell out of here! Go on!

1050
01:11:47,591 --> 01:11:50,261
Get out of the apartment right now.
Just go.

1051
01:11:51,804 --> 01:11:53,556
What's going on? What's happening?

1052
01:11:53,639 --> 01:11:55,683
Vito thinks the Risollis killed Johnny.

1053
01:11:55,766 --> 01:11:58,185
Things are a little dicey right now.

1054
01:11:58,436 --> 01:11:59,770
I'm fine.

1055
01:12:00,438 --> 01:12:03,816
Vito was worried so he sent Uncle Vinnie
to watch out for me.

1056
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:05,609
Isn't that sweet of him?

1057
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:07,611
Daddy?

1058
01:12:08,362 --> 01:12:09,530
You there?

1059
01:12:10,656 --> 01:12:12,116
Okay, listen to me.

1060
01:12:12,783 --> 01:12:15,745
Whatever you do,
I can't explain this right now...

1061
01:12:15,953 --> 01:12:19,498
...but don't tell anyone there's trouble
between you and Michael.

1062
01:12:19,582 --> 01:12:22,418
It's very, very important. You understand?

1063
01:12:24,128 --> 01:12:26,881
-Let me talk to Vinnie.
-Sure, one sec.

1064
01:12:27,131 --> 01:12:28,299
It's Daddy.

1065
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:34,847
You touch one hair on her head, I swear...

1066
01:12:35,055 --> 01:12:36,432
...you'll beg me to kill you!

1067
01:12:36,515 --> 01:12:39,894
Listen, I'm just doing my job.
All right, Frank?

1068
01:12:40,102 --> 01:12:44,190
You do what you gotta do,
and everything will be okay. All right?

1069
01:12:44,398 --> 01:12:45,524
You--

1070
01:13:21,602 --> 01:13:22,728
So?

1071
01:13:28,192 --> 01:13:29,902
They know what happened.

1072
01:13:32,363 --> 01:13:33,989
They know about Gina?

1073
01:13:36,575 --> 01:13:38,202
They think it was you.

1074
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,581
What's gonna happen?

1075
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:45,584
They gotta take care of you, Michael.

1076
01:13:46,418 --> 01:13:48,003
What does that mean?

1077
01:13:48,379 --> 01:13:49,797
It means...

1078
01:13:50,089 --> 01:13:52,091
...they ordered someone to....

1079
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:55,427
Whack me?

1080
01:14:00,015 --> 01:14:01,475
Do we know who?

1081
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:04,561
Me.

1082
01:14:05,104 --> 01:14:06,105
You?

1083
01:14:07,815 --> 01:14:09,692
You're going to whack me?

1084
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:12,611
Stop saying that. You sound like an idiot!

1085
01:14:14,738 --> 01:14:19,326
Vito wants me to do it at the wedding,
during your speech.

1086
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:22,454
That way he figures he gets us both.

1087
01:14:22,705 --> 01:14:27,459
You die, and I lose Gina
by killing the man she loves.

1088
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:30,379
But there isn't gonna be a wedding.

1089
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:33,257
So I can't do it then.

1090
01:14:34,133 --> 01:14:37,136
You mean, you can't do it then...

1091
01:14:37,469 --> 01:14:39,221
...or you can't do it, then?

1092
01:14:40,514 --> 01:14:42,016
The first one.

1093
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:45,144
Right.

1094
01:14:46,854 --> 01:14:50,816
They got Gina. If I don't do it,
Vinnie's gonna kill her.

1095
01:14:51,025 --> 01:14:52,026
My God!

1096
01:14:52,317 --> 01:14:56,363
It's one of these honor things, you know.
A life for a life.

1097
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:00,325
Bottom line...

1098
01:15:01,785 --> 01:15:04,496
...Vito's not gonna rest
until he sees a body.

1099
01:15:06,331 --> 01:15:08,625
A body. Right.

1100
01:15:28,645 --> 01:15:31,482
This is probably a stupid question, but...

1101
01:15:32,149 --> 01:15:34,485
...to your knowledge, does this hurt?

1102
01:15:36,528 --> 01:15:37,613
No.

1103
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:40,199
You won't feel a thing.

1104
01:15:40,657 --> 01:15:41,700
Ready?

1105
01:15:42,826 --> 01:15:43,911
Ready.

1106
01:15:52,044 --> 01:15:55,506
That is surprisingly painful.
Is it meant to hurt that much?

1107
01:15:55,672 --> 01:15:57,508
Let me check that for you.

1108
01:15:58,717 --> 01:16:02,095
When Michael gets up
to give his bridegroom speech...

1109
01:16:02,387 --> 01:16:05,557
...you shoot him twice,
then our guys shoot you.

1110
01:16:05,724 --> 01:16:09,019
We'll stitch the squib controls
inside your tuxedos...

1111
01:16:09,228 --> 01:16:13,482
...so you gotta learn to set them off
yourselves, in sync with the gunshots.

1112
01:16:13,607 --> 01:16:14,858
Can you handle it?

1113
01:16:14,942 --> 01:16:17,110
Any problems, speak now.

1114
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:20,155
This thing is potentially huge for us.

1115
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:21,532
Massive.

1116
01:16:22,533 --> 01:16:24,660
Questions? Worries?
Something you need?

1117
01:16:24,743 --> 01:16:26,578
Well, just one thing.

1118
01:16:27,454 --> 01:16:28,497
The bride.

1119
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:30,123
We don't take bribes!

1120
01:16:30,207 --> 01:16:31,500
-Bride!
-Pardon?

1121
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:33,961
-Bride!
-Take them goddamn things off your head!

1122
01:16:34,086 --> 01:16:35,128
Yes, sir!

1123
01:16:35,629 --> 01:16:38,048
The Handy Bundler
is virtually indestructible!

1124
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:41,260
Even the law can use Handy Bundler
to detain criminals.

1125
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,513
You'll find hundreds of uses
for the Handy Bundler...

1126
01:16:44,721 --> 01:16:48,100
...at home, in the office and on thejob.

1127
01:16:55,482 --> 01:16:58,318
These guys are doing the flowers
for the wedding?

1128
01:16:58,443 --> 01:17:00,654
Yeah. They're supposed to be great.

1129
01:17:00,737 --> 01:17:04,116
Thanks. I think I'll be safe
with Michael inside.

1130
01:17:25,637 --> 01:17:26,930
What's going on?

1131
01:17:27,055 --> 01:17:29,599
They don't know anything at all about you.

1132
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,186
-They think I shot Johnny.
-But you didn't!

1133
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:34,938
Act like you're in love.

1134
01:17:35,856 --> 01:17:37,024
Who are you?

1135
01:17:37,149 --> 01:17:39,985
FBl. How are you today?

1136
01:17:40,235 --> 01:17:41,903
Vito doesn't know that I know this...

1137
01:17:41,987 --> 01:17:45,365
...but your father has orders to kill me
at our wedding reception.

1138
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:47,576
-Michael will be wearing a wire.
-What?

1139
01:17:47,784 --> 01:17:52,289
Vito won't be afraid to talk
because he thinks I'm about to die.

1140
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,624
When he incriminates himself--

1141
01:17:54,666 --> 01:17:57,169
Our guys come in. Bingo! Got him.

1142
01:17:59,504 --> 01:18:01,173
And that's the end of it.

1143
01:18:02,966 --> 01:18:05,260
You think I'd help trap my own father?

1144
01:18:05,343 --> 01:18:07,220
Your father is with us.

1145
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:10,682
You're more important to him
than they are.

1146
01:18:11,099 --> 01:18:13,310
It's our only way out of this alive.

1147
01:18:17,064 --> 01:18:19,232
Then I guess I don't have a choice.

1148
01:18:20,192 --> 01:18:21,651
Everything okay?

1149
01:18:22,152 --> 01:18:24,696
Everything's fine. Decisions, you know?

1150
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:27,199
I think we're through.

1151
01:18:28,366 --> 01:18:33,246
Excuse me! Any panics, any questions,
you just give us a call.

1152
01:18:33,497 --> 01:18:36,249
"Tony and Guy, don't be shy."

1153
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,084
'Bye then, darling.

1154
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:39,503
See you later.

1155
01:18:47,552 --> 01:18:50,972
I can't do this! We have to tell her
Frank will pretend to shoot me.

1156
01:18:51,056 --> 01:18:54,851
No way. Her reaction is everything.
It has to be real.

1157
01:19:22,087 --> 01:19:23,588
Kitchen team moving.

1158
01:19:24,464 --> 01:19:26,216
Bridal limo en route.

1159
01:19:26,424 --> 01:19:29,719
Good. Okay, gentlemen,
the limo is on its way.

1160
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:34,099
These are the squibs. Two controllers,
one in each pocket.

1161
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:39,312
Now, a squeeze or a sharp tap
sets them off. Do you understand?

1162
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:43,108
How do you do? I'm the best man.

1163
01:19:43,358 --> 01:19:46,486
Hello. My name's Peter. I'm the best man.

1164
01:19:46,653 --> 01:19:49,948
I work at Mark and Spencer's.
I love chocolate biscuits.

1165
01:19:50,115 --> 01:19:52,659
Oh, Mumsy, I want some ginger beer!

1166
01:19:58,123 --> 01:19:59,791
Here she is!

1167
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:03,169
Here's the bride! Hi, pretty!

1168
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:04,963
Oh, my God!

1169
01:20:09,759 --> 01:20:12,262
Not much of a job though, is it, Vinnie?

1170
01:20:20,937 --> 01:20:22,605
Thank you so much.

1171
01:20:26,776 --> 01:20:28,194
My leg!

1172
01:20:33,533 --> 01:20:36,453
Testing, one, two, three. Do you read?

1173
01:20:36,703 --> 01:20:40,498
Testing, one, two, three.
Do you read? Do you read?

1174
01:20:40,707 --> 01:20:43,335
Remember, we'll need Graziosi
loud and clear.

1175
01:20:43,543 --> 01:20:45,879
-You got lots of time.
-Only until the speeches.

1176
01:20:45,962 --> 01:20:47,756
Right. After the dancing and dessert.

1177
01:20:47,839 --> 01:20:51,718
This is an ltalian wedding.
The speeches are before the dinner.

1178
01:20:51,926 --> 01:20:53,470
You knew that, right?

1179
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:56,765
You still got plenty of time.

1180
01:20:56,848 --> 01:21:00,393
Plenty of time?
You have 10 minutes if you're lucky!

1181
01:21:01,353 --> 01:21:04,397
This is not a problem. Gonna be okay.

1182
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:07,150
We have a problem.

1183
01:21:10,487 --> 01:21:12,739
"And Michael Andrew Felgate...

1184
01:21:13,031 --> 01:21:17,243
"...do you take Gina Maria Vitale
for your lawful wife...

1185
01:21:17,494 --> 01:21:19,245
"...to have and to hold...

1186
01:21:19,537 --> 01:21:22,832
"...from this day forward,
for better, for worse...

1187
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:25,001
"...for richer, for poorer...

1188
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:29,005
"...in sickness and in health,
until death do you part?"

1189
01:21:29,297 --> 01:21:30,381
I do.

1190
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,676
"You have declared your consent
before the Church.

1191
01:21:33,885 --> 01:21:35,929
"May the Lord in His goodness...

1192
01:21:36,012 --> 01:21:39,891
"...strengthen your consent
and fill you both with His blessings.

1193
01:21:40,141 --> 01:21:41,059
"Amen.

1194
01:21:41,184 --> 01:21:45,772
"ln the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit...

1195
01:21:46,022 --> 01:21:48,858
"...l pronounce you husband and wife."

1196
01:21:50,735 --> 01:21:52,403
You may kiss the bride.

1197
01:22:09,087 --> 01:22:11,214
Hey! Wedding! Smile!

1198
01:22:12,423 --> 01:22:13,925
Wedding!

1199
01:22:15,593 --> 01:22:17,846
Kitchen team, we've got one shot at this.

1200
01:22:17,929 --> 01:22:20,473
And less than five minutes
before the speeches.

1201
01:22:20,557 --> 01:22:21,808
We got it.

1202
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:23,810
About the other day--

1203
01:22:23,893 --> 01:22:26,855
I don't want to hear.
I'm sure you had your reasons.

1204
01:22:26,938 --> 01:22:29,816
No names, no pack drill. That's my motto.

1205
01:22:30,066 --> 01:22:31,985
That's incredibly nice of you.

1206
01:22:32,068 --> 01:22:34,112
Goodness, are you drinking?

1207
01:22:34,779 --> 01:22:36,865
-Come on, darling.
-I've only had one glass.

1208
01:22:36,948 --> 01:22:38,867
-Let me take that.
-She thinks I'm drunk!

1209
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:41,160
You're very embarrassing
when you're drunk.

1210
01:22:46,874 --> 01:22:48,459
I think you're on now.

1211
01:22:55,883 --> 01:22:57,302
In position.

1212
01:22:58,136 --> 01:23:02,473
I just wanted to say how sorry I am
about your son.

1213
01:23:03,433 --> 01:23:04,726
Thank you.

1214
01:23:06,769 --> 01:23:08,479
This is a happy day.

1215
01:23:08,813 --> 01:23:10,440
I wish you much joy.

1216
01:23:11,357 --> 01:23:14,193
I especially look forward to the speeches.

1217
01:23:18,364 --> 01:23:21,367
You're very kind,
and I appreciate the way you've...

1218
01:23:22,327 --> 01:23:24,579
...opened my eyes to new possibilities.

1219
01:23:24,662 --> 01:23:26,372
As a matter of fact...

1220
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:29,584
...l recently thought of a new idea
that I think...

1221
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:32,170
...could be profitable to us both.

1222
01:23:34,297 --> 01:23:36,215
Absurdly profitable, really.

1223
01:23:36,716 --> 01:23:38,676
I mean, we're talking millions.

1224
01:23:41,137 --> 01:23:44,140
But this isn't the occasion
to be talking business.

1225
01:23:44,307 --> 01:23:45,808
Another time perhaps.

1226
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:48,061
Thank you so much for being here.

1227
01:23:49,145 --> 01:23:50,396
He's lost his mind.

1228
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,149
And speeches in 04:05.

1229
01:23:54,942 --> 01:23:56,444
Are you out of your mind?

1230
01:23:56,527 --> 01:23:58,446
-He wasn't ready. Relax.
-Relax?

1231
01:23:58,529 --> 01:24:00,073
Congratulations!

1232
01:24:01,824 --> 01:24:04,535
In five minutes, we're dead.
You, me and Gina.

1233
01:24:04,827 --> 01:24:06,371
Never chase the bid.

1234
01:24:06,496 --> 01:24:07,455
What?

1235
01:24:07,663 --> 01:24:09,957
Let the bid come to you.
It's rule number one.

1236
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:12,293
What the hell are you talking about?

1237
01:24:12,543 --> 01:24:15,088
Mr. Graziosi wants to see you over there.

1238
01:24:15,421 --> 01:24:17,215
Of course. A pleasure.

1239
01:24:20,551 --> 01:24:22,970
I think we're in business.

1240
01:24:23,179 --> 01:24:24,389
Speeches in three.

1241
01:24:27,225 --> 01:24:29,727
We have to go say hi to Maria.

1242
01:24:33,564 --> 01:24:38,069
So basically you continue to sell
and buy interesting work through us...

1243
01:24:39,028 --> 01:24:42,198
...and I do the insurance valuation
on the collection.

1244
01:24:42,615 --> 01:24:46,119
Like insurance against a fire, for example.

1245
01:24:46,953 --> 01:24:48,663
Fires can happen.

1246
01:24:48,913 --> 01:24:50,373
Look at Sotheby's.

1247
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:56,712
But fortunately, of course,
you would be handsomely covered.

1248
01:24:58,131 --> 01:24:59,549
What do you think?

1249
01:25:04,137 --> 01:25:05,721
Are we in business?

1250
01:25:08,182 --> 01:25:09,642
-Say it!
-In two.

1251
01:25:11,644 --> 01:25:13,354
Michael! There you are!

1252
01:25:14,772 --> 01:25:16,190
You look serious.

1253
01:25:16,607 --> 01:25:17,650
Cheer up!

1254
01:25:17,775 --> 01:25:20,194
Those are quite something. Mind if l--

1255
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:22,572
-Take it easy.
-It's quite all right.

1256
01:25:25,283 --> 01:25:26,784
What do you think?

1257
01:25:26,826 --> 01:25:29,662
Philip, this is Uncle Vito.

1258
01:25:29,829 --> 01:25:30,955
Delighted to meet you.

1259
01:25:31,038 --> 01:25:32,790
You from the old country?

1260
01:25:35,293 --> 01:25:37,003
My family's from Sicily.

1261
01:25:39,297 --> 01:25:40,756
Land of the goat.

1262
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,384
My wife and I spent
a wonderful week there.

1263
01:25:43,467 --> 01:25:46,804
Charming little pensione
with a priceless little owner...

1264
01:25:47,013 --> 01:25:48,681
...who looked just like a Mafiosi.

1265
01:25:48,764 --> 01:25:51,309
We called him AI Capone.
Remember, darling?

1266
01:25:53,144 --> 01:25:55,313
These things are making me squiffy!

1267
01:25:56,856 --> 01:25:59,191
Thank you. Excuse me.

1268
01:26:01,152 --> 01:26:02,737
I'm sorry, Philip. Uncle Vito!

1269
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:06,073
I am a ninny!
I forgot to tell you the good news.

1270
01:26:06,324 --> 01:26:10,453
Mr. Morganson here has decided
Cromwell's are the team for him.

1271
01:26:13,664 --> 01:26:15,041
That's marvelous news.

1272
01:26:15,124 --> 01:26:17,126
We must meet and discuss the details.

1273
01:26:17,209 --> 01:26:19,670
Let me just find my--

1274
01:26:26,886 --> 01:26:30,306
I'll have Helen leave a message on Monday.
Excuse me.

1275
01:26:31,474 --> 01:26:35,603
What a horrible thing to happen.
I'm sure he meant it as a joke.

1276
01:26:35,853 --> 01:26:38,356
Could I borrow him for a second? Thanks.

1277
01:26:40,358 --> 01:26:43,527
That was quite something.
I love party tricks.

1278
01:26:45,196 --> 01:26:49,033
Pray gather round
from the farthest reaches!

1279
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,327
And take your seats...

1280
01:26:51,911 --> 01:26:54,455
...to hear the speeches!

1281
01:26:54,538 --> 01:26:56,540
And the speeches are early.

1282
01:27:02,171 --> 01:27:04,340
Listen, I swear to God I'll do it.

1283
01:27:04,965 --> 01:27:09,178
I'm begging you, for Gina's sake,
let me wait till the party's over.

1284
01:27:09,512 --> 01:27:12,598
During the speeches. For Gina's sake.

1285
01:27:18,646 --> 01:27:19,980
Please, we have to hurry.

1286
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:23,609
I'm going as fast as I can,
but it's rather a mess.

1287
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:26,487
Turn around. I need to tuck it in properly.

1288
01:27:29,073 --> 01:27:31,492
English. Figured as much.

1289
01:27:32,034 --> 01:27:36,080
Just shove it in there. Shove it in there!
God! No, stuff it in!

1290
01:27:37,915 --> 01:27:39,375
Give me your gun.

1291
01:27:41,210 --> 01:27:43,212
Give me your gun, Frank.

1292
01:27:50,553 --> 01:27:51,804
Johnny's.

1293
01:27:52,263 --> 01:27:56,308
His first. I want you to use this one.

1294
01:27:59,478 --> 01:28:01,188
I think he gave Frank a live gun.

1295
01:28:01,313 --> 01:28:03,524
-I suggest abort. I repeat, abort!
-No!

1296
01:28:04,108 --> 01:28:06,652
We can still get this. Get a mike in there.

1297
01:28:06,735 --> 01:28:10,447
Kitchen team, get into position,
but nobody goes in until I say so.

1298
01:28:10,531 --> 01:28:11,699
-Sir.
-Shut up!

1299
01:28:11,782 --> 01:28:13,117
Copy that.

1300
01:28:17,788 --> 01:28:20,124
Best man. How do you do?

1301
01:28:20,457 --> 01:28:24,170
Excuse me, but I rather think
you're wilting there, old boy.

1302
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:25,838
There we are.

1303
01:28:25,963 --> 01:28:27,673
There we are.

1304
01:28:28,966 --> 01:28:30,176
Welcome back.

1305
01:28:32,428 --> 01:28:33,554
See you later, then.

1306
01:28:33,637 --> 01:28:35,639
Ladies and gentlemen...

1307
01:28:35,723 --> 01:28:39,184
...perhaps you'd like to give a big hand...

1308
01:28:39,476 --> 01:28:42,062
...to Gina and Mike!

1309
01:28:51,363 --> 01:28:54,116
You gotta get in here. It's too late.
He's gonna die.

1310
01:28:54,658 --> 01:28:57,244
No. This has been nine years.
Kitchen team.

1311
01:28:57,494 --> 01:28:58,662
Standing by.

1312
01:28:58,787 --> 01:29:00,164
Wait for my word.

1313
01:29:12,384 --> 01:29:15,387
We still got a chance. Frank's got a mike.

1314
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:16,680
But....

1315
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:18,432
What?

1316
01:29:19,475 --> 01:29:21,352
Vito gave him a live gun.

1317
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,775
All right. All right.

1318
01:29:28,025 --> 01:29:31,487
Now, can your clapping,
'cause here's you know whom:

1319
01:29:31,612 --> 01:29:34,448
My new brother and our bridegroom.

1320
01:29:34,657 --> 01:29:36,492
All right. Come on.

1321
01:29:36,575 --> 01:29:38,827
Mikey, we're waiting!

1322
01:29:39,662 --> 01:29:41,330
We're waiting, Mikey!

1323
01:29:41,497 --> 01:29:44,833
You're getting married. Thattaboy!

1324
01:29:57,805 --> 01:29:58,889
Speak up!

1325
01:30:00,307 --> 01:30:01,642
Sorry.

1326
01:30:03,769 --> 01:30:05,396
This is making me nervous.

1327
01:30:05,521 --> 01:30:07,648
The last time I spoke at a wedding...

1328
01:30:07,773 --> 01:30:10,943
...l was supposed to propose a toast
to the bridesmaids.

1329
01:30:11,068 --> 01:30:13,320
I ended up proposing an opening bid.

1330
01:30:13,404 --> 01:30:15,447
What's worse is they both sold.

1331
01:30:16,407 --> 01:30:18,158
Want it in the head or the chest?

1332
01:30:18,242 --> 01:30:20,577
Come on. Come on!

1333
01:30:23,414 --> 01:30:25,582
-So I'll keep it simple.
-Good idea!

1334
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:29,586
Andjust tell you why I think today,
for once...

1335
01:30:30,045 --> 01:30:32,548
...l'm the one acquiring the masterpiece.

1336
01:30:34,925 --> 01:30:38,429
Firstly, I've always been a huge fan
of the ltalian school.

1337
01:30:41,849 --> 01:30:43,434
Come on, speak to me.

1338
01:30:44,852 --> 01:30:46,311
It's not working.

1339
01:30:47,396 --> 01:30:51,900
They say that the real test
of a masterpiece...

1340
01:30:52,234 --> 01:30:55,195
...is whether you instinctively know
it's something...

1341
01:30:55,654 --> 01:30:57,364
...you'll keep forever...

1342
01:30:57,823 --> 01:30:59,324
...love forever.

1343
01:31:02,953 --> 01:31:05,456
Don't think of it as gaining a son.

1344
01:31:05,664 --> 01:31:07,166
Ifyou don't do it...

1345
01:31:07,249 --> 01:31:08,709
...you're losing a daughter.

1346
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:10,836
-Sir?
-No good.

1347
01:31:12,838 --> 01:31:14,464
In some cases....

1348
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:17,092
In some cases...

1349
01:31:17,301 --> 01:31:21,305
...it's even something you'd be prepared
to die to protect.

1350
01:31:23,182 --> 01:31:25,100
That's certainly the case here.

1351
01:31:25,309 --> 01:31:28,020
I'd rather die than see any harm
come to Gina.

1352
01:31:28,937 --> 01:31:31,440
I love her more than my own life.

1353
01:31:33,358 --> 01:31:37,487
And I hope I'm making myself crystal clear
on that point.

1354
01:31:39,406 --> 01:31:40,657
Death...

1355
01:31:40,949 --> 01:31:42,826
...is okay by me.

1356
01:31:46,997 --> 01:31:50,167
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the fa ther of the bride.

1357
01:31:56,965 --> 01:31:59,176
For chrissakes, Bob, this is it.

1358
01:31:59,343 --> 01:32:01,386
Damn it! Kitchen team, go!

1359
01:32:13,899 --> 01:32:16,485
Excuse me! FBl!

1360
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,716
It's bullshit!

1361
01:32:40,217 --> 01:32:41,218
Do it!

1362
01:32:41,635 --> 01:32:42,552
-Do it!
-No!

1363
01:32:43,762 --> 01:32:45,472
-Vinnie, do it!
-Vinnie, no!

1364
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:48,016
Do it! Do it!

1365
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,017
No.

1366
01:32:49,226 --> 01:32:50,602
Vinnie, do it!

1367
01:32:51,103 --> 01:32:52,688
I'm ordering you! Kill her!

1368
01:32:52,813 --> 01:32:54,356
Yes! Got him!

1369
01:32:55,399 --> 01:32:57,734
FBl! Freeze!

1370
01:32:59,653 --> 01:33:00,487
No!

1371
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,542
Ambulance, now!

1372
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:15,043
It's too late!

1373
01:33:45,115 --> 01:33:46,992
Let's go! The party's over!

1374
01:33:54,666 --> 01:33:56,251
-On three.
-I'm ready!

1375
01:34:17,981 --> 01:34:19,608
I'm sorry.

1376
01:34:19,941 --> 01:34:21,902
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

1377
01:34:23,612 --> 01:34:25,989
You should both be sorry.

1378
01:34:29,326 --> 01:34:31,661
These things are surprisingly painful.

1379
01:34:32,162 --> 01:34:33,038
My God!

1380
01:34:33,163 --> 01:34:35,165
It's a new rule of mine:

1381
01:34:35,373 --> 01:34:38,043
Always assume you guys
are hiding something.

1382
01:34:39,628 --> 01:34:40,462
Why--

1383
01:34:40,587 --> 01:34:44,716
When I thought of you with a gun,
Michael, suddenly I wanted a backup.

1384
01:34:44,883 --> 01:34:46,301
You did good.

1385
01:34:50,347 --> 01:34:51,473
Oh, my God!

1386
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:53,099
I'll tell you, Frank...

1387
01:34:53,183 --> 01:34:56,102
...her father might act
like a moron sometimes....

1388
01:34:58,188 --> 01:34:59,397
So I retired.

1389
01:34:59,856 --> 01:35:01,107
I'm telling you, Frankie...

1390
01:35:01,191 --> 01:35:02,651
...the kid's a genius.

1391
01:35:02,734 --> 01:35:04,236
I mean, think about it.

1392
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:07,197
You got Vito.
Vito thinks he got his revenge.

1393
01:35:07,572 --> 01:35:10,700
And that's it. Badda-bing. You're even.

1394
01:35:11,034 --> 01:35:13,370
You're in the clear. All of you.

1395
01:35:13,536 --> 01:35:16,915
-How the hell could you do this to me?
-You were gonna do it to me.

1396
01:35:16,998 --> 01:35:19,459
-We did it because we love you.
-Same here.

1397
01:35:19,668 --> 01:35:20,710
What?

1398
01:35:20,919 --> 01:35:23,254
You love both of us?

1399
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:29,344
I don't think so, Michael.

1400
01:35:32,681 --> 01:35:33,640
Oh, my God.

1401
01:35:33,723 --> 01:35:35,892
-Wasn't that the--
-Oh, my God!

1402
01:35:37,394 --> 01:35:39,312
Welcome to the halfway point...

1403
01:35:39,396 --> 01:35:43,274
...in the annual Central Park
Senior Marathon.

1404
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:49,823
-Leave me alone!
-Wait! Listen. Listen!

1405
01:35:50,031 --> 01:35:52,075
This picture, it isn't me.

1406
01:35:52,283 --> 01:35:55,078
It's Kansas City Little
Big Mickey Blue Eyes!

1407
01:35:55,245 --> 01:35:58,164
I was pretending to be a mobster,
and couldn't say my R's...

1408
01:35:58,248 --> 01:36:01,251
...and I had to kiss the waitress
or they would've killed us!

1409
01:36:01,334 --> 01:36:03,086
Look who's sitting next to me.

1410
01:36:04,462 --> 01:36:06,131
Recognize that suit?

1411
01:36:06,715 --> 01:36:08,008
Is that Dad?

1412
01:36:08,258 --> 01:36:10,427
This photo means nothing.

1413
01:36:13,138 --> 01:36:15,265
-So who's Mickey Blue Eyes?
-I am.

1414
01:36:15,807 --> 01:36:18,685
I mean, I was. We just made him up.

1415
01:36:18,893 --> 01:36:20,895
Come back and I'll explain everything.

1416
01:36:20,979 --> 01:36:24,816
So when you said you were
with my dad that day, you were--

1417
01:36:25,066 --> 01:36:27,235
I was telling the truth.

1418
01:36:29,237 --> 01:36:32,323
-You told me a lot of other lies.
-I know.

1419
01:36:32,615 --> 01:36:36,661
I know. I thought it was the only way
to keep you.

1420
01:36:37,162 --> 01:36:38,705
But you were right.

1421
01:36:38,955 --> 01:36:41,249
It was the only sure way to lose you.

1422
01:36:47,505 --> 01:36:49,632
-I was right.
-You were.

1423
01:36:49,841 --> 01:36:52,469
-And smarter than you all along.
-Yes.

1424
01:36:53,052 --> 01:36:55,180
-And braver.
-Much.

1425
01:36:55,972 --> 01:36:57,766
And more convincing at being shot.

1426
01:36:58,016 --> 01:36:59,267
Infinitely.

1427
01:37:01,519 --> 01:37:03,062
Marry me, Gina.

1428
01:37:05,648 --> 01:37:07,984
Would I have to be Mrs. Blue Eyes?

1429
01:37:10,028 --> 01:37:11,237
Come here....

1430
01:37:12,030 --> 01:37:13,031
What?

1431
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:14,699
Come here.

1432
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:17,660
-What?
-It's me.

1433
01:37:17,744 --> 01:37:19,662
Mickey Blue.

1434
01:37:20,872 --> 01:37:22,081
Oh, please!

1435
01:42:01,819 --> 01:42:04,947
