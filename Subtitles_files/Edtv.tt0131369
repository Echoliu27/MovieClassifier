00:01:00,603 --> 00:01:02,814
<i>Since its debut,
True TV has brought you</i>

2
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:06,151
<i>the finest in documentary
and informational programming.</i>

3
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,570
<i>You've counted on us,
and we've taken you there.</i>

4
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:11,322
<i>From the edge of the world
to the edge of your seat,</i>

5
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:14,159
<i>from the streets of LA
to the Serengeti Plain,</i>

6
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,578
<i>from inner peace
to outer space,</i>

7
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:19,664
<i>your funniest moments
and most tragic times.</i>

8
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:22,917
<i>You've laughed, you've cried,
you've almost died.</i>

9
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:26,296
<i>But now we'll take you where
you've never been before.</i>

10
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:30,049
<i>No script, no actors,
no editing.</i>

11
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,886
<i>All day, all night, all true.</i>

12
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,014
<i>Every second is true
on True TV!</i>

13
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:38,057
<i>This spring.</i>

14
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:43,521
<i>So, any questions?</i>

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,775
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Okay.

16
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,611
I think we get
that it's true,
but what is it?

17
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,363
<i>Cynthia,
why don't you come up here.
This is your moment.</i>

18
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:53,782
<i>Folks, this is
Cynthia Topping,</i>

19
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,867
<i>she's the program director
at True TV.</i>

20
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,746
<i>She's the one that's gonna be
strapped to a Scud missile
if this idea doesn't work.</i>

21
00:02:01,456 --> 00:02:06,211
<i>Thank you, Mr. Whitaker.
I've always wanted to travel.
The missile. Yes?</i>

22
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:11,716
Isn't this show similar
to a show that PBS had on
in the '70s, the <i>Loud Family?</i>

23
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,344
<i>No, this is
completely different.</i>

24
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:18,389
<i>We're gonna pick
one person,</i>

25
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:22,727
<i>one normal person, uh,
not like you folks.</i>

26
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,651
<i>And we're gonna put that
person's life on television
all day long, uh, live.</i>

27
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:31,528
<i>It's not PBS,
it's not</i> Real World.

28
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:33,780
<i>We're not gonna film it
and then edit it later.</i>

29
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,574
Is that how I sound?
I don't sound like that, do I?

30
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,743
More or less.
On a good day.

31
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:40,537
You never said anything?

32
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,872
Look, I don't mean
to be negative here.

33
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:44,958
Ooh!
Hey!

34
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,169
Now, I know this was
your idea and all,

35
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:50,880
but doesn't this have, like,
a great chance of being...

36
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:53,258
A big, smelly bomb?
Oh, you betcha. Yeah.

37
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,178
And wouldn't that be,
you know, a bad thing?

38
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:01,307
Keith, we're getting
our butts kicked by
the Gardening Channel.

39
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,767
People would
rather watch soil.

40
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:07,146
I mean, we are this close
to having chalk outlines
around our careers.

41
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:10,942
I love that we're doing this,
and I love that it's risky.

42
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,778
All anyone ever does
in this business
is follow the pack.

43
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,905
I mean, hell,
if people tune into this

44
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,491
twice a day
for five minutes,
we're a hit.

45
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,952
And you know what
finally convinced me
that this could work?

46
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,079
Half a dozen
wine coolers?

47
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:26,207
It's when I realized that
the person we pick,

48
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,460
the guy that's on
TV all day long, doesn't
even have to be good.

49
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:32,672
I mean, if he's good,
great, but if he's bad,
even better.

50
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:33,965
Bad is better?

51
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,384
People can't turn away
from an accident.

52
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,844
You know, you drive by
and you say,

53
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,847
"Ooh, I hope there's not
a head in the road.
That would be..."

54
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,308
But then you look.
You don't want to miss it.

55
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,060
So we put a guy on TV,
and we just sit and wait,

56
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,646
and see if that head
starts rolling down
the highway.

57
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,815
Now, that's fun
for the whole family.

58
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,609
So, what's
our next step?

59
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:53,776
Yeah,
I'd love to know that.

60
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:57,155
We find ourselves
a big, fat, rolling head.

61
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,993
Are you seeing this?
Are you looking around you?
Are you...

62
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:05,246
God,
you know what this is?

63
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,832
Oh! This is
a horror show.

64
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,751
What are you going off
about now, John boy?

65
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,169
You know what.
This doesn't bug you?

66
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,796
All our friends
and everybody
getting married

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,424
and they're having kids
and their careers.

68
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,968
And their kids
are having careers.
It's a mess.

69
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,386
Why would that
bug me, man?

70
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,181
I mean, look at us, right?
We are doing fine.

71
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:24,974
Oh.

72
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,352
Okay. You have a beer
around your neck.

73
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,688
- That's my point!
- Hey, there's Ray!

74
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,857
Your brother's here.
Go long, man.

75
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,778
I'm gonna go over
and say hi to Kim.

76
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:39,781
Oh, hey, yeah, listen.
That was great tonight.
I loved it.

77
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,115
Oh, man.

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,284
What's going on, man?

79
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:44,577
I'm telling you,
it's weird.

80
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:47,080
It's like, we meet,
we go out
a couple of times

81
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,707
and then, bing bang boom,
she's got me meeting
her parents.

82
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,793
What do you mean
"bing bang boom"?

83
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,754
Buddy, you've been going out
with her for six months.

84
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,048
Yeah?
Yeah.

85
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,884
I suddenly feel
like the walls are
closing in on me.

86
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:06,391
You know... The father is
sitting there asking me
about my career prospects.

87
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,767
Can you believe that?

88
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,435
Oh! At dinner,

89
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,480
the dog is sniffing
my balls.

90
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,232
I mean, at least I hope
it was the dog,

91
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:17,360
because
her mother disappeared
for a while.

92
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,781
Hey, what's going on
over there?

93
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:25,326
They're doing audition tapes
for that True TV thing.

94
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,912
People are sending them in
from all over the place.

95
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,872
Oh, yeah?
That's cool!

96
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,165
What's cool?

97
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:35,044
To be that guy, that guy
they watch all day.
Get out of here.

98
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,921
Hey, I'm telling you.
Mark my words.

99
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:38,965
That guy is going
to be famous.

100
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:42,593
He'll be able to get
whatever he wants,
whoever he wants.

101
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,637
Hey. Trust me.
This is my business.

102
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:46,014
What is?

103
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:47,473
Show business.

104
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,183
Oh, you're in
show business now?

105
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,977
Yeah, I service
video equipment.

106
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:56,858
That's like saying
the people stitching Nikes
in Panama are in the NBA.

107
00:05:58,276 --> 00:05:59,277
Hello.

108
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,821
Bed wetter.
Thumb sucker.

109
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,282
Hey, you know what?

110
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,783
I'm going to go
make a tape.
You know what?

111
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:07,368
I'm excited.

112
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:11,748
All right, so...
I know that
I can do this.

113
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,249
It's my turn.
I'm next.

114
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,626
Hey, Buzz,
can I get one more?

115
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,878
You got it.

116
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,338
Hello, there.
Hey.

117
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,133
So Ray met
the family, huh?
Huh?

118
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,968
Oh, yeah.

119
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,346
I heard the dog
really liked him.
Yeah.

120
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,682
Oh, the whole family
loved him.

121
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:34,020
Of course,
my whole family really loved
the last guy I went out with

122
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,481
and he strung me
along for a year
and then dumped me.

123
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,441
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

124
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:46,616
And, you know, every guy
I ever broke up with,

125
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:49,702
the minute it's over,
I could tell you
what went wrong.

126
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,162
How it went wrong,

127
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,915
why it had to go wrong.

128
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,000
But when I'm in it,

129
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:57,835
lost.

130
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:01,422
I'm like a love coroner!

131
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,634
You know, bring me
the corpse, I'll tell you
what killed it.

132
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,553
But how to prevent it?
Lost.

133
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,598
Hey, y'all!

134
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,391
I'm Ray Pekurny!

135
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:17,313
I'm from right here
in San Francisco,

136
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,232
the greatest city
in the world.

137
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:20,525
Yeah!

138
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,443
Are you with me?

139
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:23,861
Go Niners!

140
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,613
Yeah!

141
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:30,284
Okay. I want
to introduce you
to my girlfriend.

142
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:34,413
She's really cute,
she's really cool...

143
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:37,375
No!
...and she's really strong.

144
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,879
She's a UPS person, you know.
She lifts packages.
Not beefy or anything.

145
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,758
She told me this joke.
"What do you get when
you cross UPS with FedEx?

146
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,343
"Fed up!"

147
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,387
It's her joke.

148
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,306
Oh, my brother.
Ed, yeah, come on.

149
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:58,896
Come on,
say something, Ed.
Asshole.

150
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,400
Come on, man.
Say something.
All right. Um...

151
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:06,571
I don't know about this
whole 24-hour TV thing
you all got going,

152
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:10,616
but if you're gonna go
forward with it,
this is your man.

153
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,952
Smart man. That's it.
The Ray-man here.
This guy's got stories.

154
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:15,955
This guy has lived.
I've got stories.
I've lived!

155
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,498
Tell them about
that dog-grooming
business you started.

156
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:18,624
No, no, no. Not here.

157
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,335
<i>No, you gotta
tell them about that.
I don't really want to.</i>

158
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,587
<i>Ray, tell them.</i>

159
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,422
<i>All right, I'm telling,
I'm telling. Here we go.</i>

160
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,008
This guy?
Yeah,
take a look at this kid.

161
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,885
<i>...was gonna start up
a mobile
dog-grooming business.</i>

162
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,720
He's cute.
Really?

163
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:31,888
Yes.

164
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,307
<i>He doesn't want to be
like everybody else.
No.</i>

165
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,436
<i>He doesn't start it in
a van or a pickup truck
or something like that.</i>

166
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,191
<i>No, the Ray-man,
he starts it in a Camry!</i>

167
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,943
<i>Camry! Camry!
Camry!</i>

168
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,864
<i>So, he gets a tub, right?
He puts it in the trunk.</i>

169
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,700
<i>He throws the dogs in the tub,
slams the trunk shut,
starts driving around.</i>

170
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,785
<i>Speeds up,
stops real quick,
turns left hard,</i>

171
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,663
<i>turns right hard to get
the dogs all sudded up, right?</i>

172
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:01,959
<i>Pretty smart, right?
Now, guess how he dries
them off. Guess.</i>

173
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,628
<i>With the exhaust!</i>

174
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,881
What do you say,
I mean,
we bring him in?

175
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,217
We just...
It can't hurt.
Just talk to him.

176
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,345
Well...
I'm from East Texas.

177
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,682
<i>Yep. And, uh,
when I was, like, 13,</i>

178
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:21,103
<i>my mom got remarried
to my stepfather who was
a traveling salesman.</i>

179
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,356
<i>He got transferred up here
to San Francisco,</i>

180
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:25,483
<i>so, you know,
we all came along.</i>

181
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:28,319
<i>- Here we are, here I am.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

182
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:30,071
- Terrific.
- Yep.

183
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:31,906
And did you go
to college or...

184
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,324
I had a year at
junior college.

185
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,744
Home of the Bear Cats.

186
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,080
Oh! Scary.

187
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:40,790
What did you study?

188
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,125
Studying? Um...

189
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,543
Jeez, that'd have
been a big help.

190
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,045
That really would have.
Where were you then?

191
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,339
That's cute.

192
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,259
Straight ahead.
What? Oh, yeah.

193
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,179
<i>And as you see,
I can get rid of the Texas
accent whenever I want.</i>

194
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:59,016
<i>Or I can just slide</i>

195
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,353
real deep on into it
like this.

196
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:03,980
How do you decide?

197
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,941
Well, to tell you the truth,

198
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:12,989
I find that, uh,
this accent here don't do me
no harm with the ladies.

199
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,368
Know what I mean, darlin'?

200
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:21,956
Yep.

201
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,252
<i>No, never been
married. Um...</i>

202
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,339
<i>I've been burned
a couple times, though.</i>

203
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,341
My father?

204
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,762
Um...

205
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:40,516
Let's see. When I was 12,
my mom got a hysterectomy.

206
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,227
He ran off with her nurse,
and I haven't seen him since.

207
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,523
That's my dad,
Hank Pekurny.

208
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,276
Next question?

209
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:55,740
<i>Uh, like, one time I was
playing pee-wee football
back in Texas, right,</i>

210
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,366
<i>and I dislocated my finger.</i>

211
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,201
<i>Mom comes rolling out
of the bleachers down,</i>

212
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:02,496
busts through
this little group of kids,
grabs my finger...

213
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:03,831
<i>Pops it back into place.</i>

214
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,541
<i>Runs up, slaps the coach
upside the head</i>

215
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,752
<i>and says,
"Let's get the game on!"</i>

216
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:10,588
<i>That's Mom.</i>

217
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:15,593
And I still can't really
bend this finger, though.

218
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,600
<i>Oh... A dream?</i>

219
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,269
<i>Oh, yeah, man,
I got a dream. I, uh...</i>

220
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,689
<i>I just don't know
what it is yet, you know.</i>

221
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,752
Did you test him?
Did you do any research?

222
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,380
Research?

223
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,508
We don't even have
money in our budget
for coffee filters.

224
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,343
We're using a yarmulke.

225
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,388
But this is
who you want?

226
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:06,936
I'm going based on
something you once said
at a broadcaster's dinner.

227
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,105
I love it! I love it!

228
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,481
You see what she does?

229
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:14,568
See what she does?
She attaches me
to her choice.

230
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:18,739
Thereby fueling
my massive ego and
forcing me to like it.

231
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:21,617
You're great!
How come you never
doodle my name?

232
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:25,287
I do.
I'm joking. Joking.

233
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,540
Once again.

234
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,376
This is the guy
you want to go with?

235
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:37,675
Yes.

236
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:45,057
What happens when
you go to the bathroom?
Do they go in with you?

237
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:47,935
No, Al, the bathroom's
out of bounds.

238
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,728
Okay, dinner's
getting cold!

239
00:12:50,229 --> 00:12:52,857
You know, my life is not
so great that I want it
shown on television.

240
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,775
And neither
is yours, Ed.

241
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,403
That's the whole point.
This could change
all of that.

242
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,737
How?

243
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,531
Oh! Oh!

244
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,867
I'm glad you asked.
I want to open a gym.

245
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,951
A gymnasium?

246
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,956
No, a gym. A gymnasium is
an old, white guy shooting
free throws like this.

247
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,708
I'm talking
a modern-day
fitness center.

248
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,460
What does it have
to do with Ed?

249
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,880
Well,
if Ed is on TV for a month,
he gets a balloon payment.

250
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:17,339
That's big money.

251
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:21,343
Right. I borrow
against that right now
at the bank, I buy the gym,

252
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,471
I make Ed a silent partner,

253
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,891
and I cut all you in
for a slice because
you signed the releases.

254
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:28,809
This is gonna cost us.

255
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:30,686
It's not gonna cost...
Hey, look.

256
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,190
Open your eyes instead
of your mouth for once.
This is a no-brainer.

257
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:38,652
The whole time
I'm gonna be promoting
the gym on TV.

258
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,613
It's free advertising.

259
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:43,073
I mean, does
anyone else see this?

260
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,243
How about sex?

261
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,331
Sorry, Al,
but I'm gonna
have to pass.

262
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,876
And it's not an age thing,
'cause you are still
a handsome man.

263
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,753
No!

264
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,421
Do they show you
having sex?

265
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,425
No, Al. Look,
kissing and hugging.

266
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:03,677
Nudity?
Ed, you're not
gonna be nude.

267
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,262
Why would I be nude, Mom?

268
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,848
What kind of a show is this?
It's a filthy show!

269
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,183
It is not
a filthy show.

270
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,060
Have you even read
the whole contract?

271
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,937
Do you even know
what's in it?

272
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,605
Oh,
little Miss Cautious
all of a sudden.

273
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,024
She meets a guy in a bar,
she's married an hour later.

274
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,277
We didn't get married,
we just thought
we were married.

275
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:21,529
Marcia,
calm down, honey.

276
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:24,573
Well, he's picking at me
and he's bringing up
all kinds of issues.

277
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:28,786
Listen, married is married.
You know, maybe
this isn't a good idea.

278
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:30,829
- What isn't?
- All of it.

279
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,039
I mean,
the whole thing,
you know.

280
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:35,084
Maybe I'll just
get out now before
it gets complicated.

281
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,627
You know,
no harm, no foul.

282
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,463
Oh, great.
They had to pick you.
They couldn't pick me.

283
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,423
Well, if he doesn't
want to do it

284
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,676
"If he doesn't
want to do it"?

285
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,887
He's 31 years old,
he's a video-store clerk!

286
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,973
What is his grand
masterplan here, huh?

287
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:53,561
What, is he gonna
spend the rest of his life
rearranging Ernest movies?

288
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,647
I mean, everyone
who works there
is 12 years old.

289
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,649
They go through college,
they graduate,

290
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,526
and then they stop
working there.

291
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,777
Except for him!

292
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,488
He stays to welcome
the next batch
of 12-year-olds.

293
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,490
I mean, if you ask me,
it's a job for retards!

294
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,534
Ray, stop that!

295
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,912
- Was I being insulting?
- Uh-huh.

296
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,540
Yeah, kind of.

297
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,875
As usual.

298
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,960
I mean,
a fellow can't...

299
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:20,254
All right,
all right.
Look, look.

300
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,172
Hey.

301
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,467
You don't have
to be scared.
I'm not scared.

302
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,303
Don't be scared.

303
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,930
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.
You're scared, man.

304
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:34,143
I am not scared, Ray.
You got that
doe-in-the-headlights look.

305
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,605
You're mixing your
proteins and starches
and you can't...

306
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:38,731
Look, I'll tell you what.

307
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,899
You don't have to
worry about anything.
You know why?

308
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,109
Huh?

309
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:46,155
No, why?
Because big brother's
riding shotgun, man.

310
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:47,656
I've got your back.

311
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,618
Now, did anything
ever happen to you
when you were a kid?

312
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,453
Anyone ever bother you?

313
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,789
Just you.
Just me.

314
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,208
You bring those cameras
over to big brother

315
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,587
and I promise you,
I will make something happen
for both of us, for all of us!

316
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,893
And, you know,
how many chances do guys
like you and I get?

317
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,397
I don't know.
Yeah, that's right,
you don't know.

318
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,993
<i>Guys, when am I gonna
get my on-air feed?</i>

319
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,162
<i>All I'm getting
are color bars.</i>

320
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,580
<i>Mike, loosen up
just a little bit.</i>

321
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,916
<i>Stand by
to lose laser.</i>
<i>Good.</i>

322
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,584
<i>TOC.
We're ready to feed.</i>

323
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:43,253
<i>Carlos, now show me
where you're gonna be
when we go live.</i>

324
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,090
<i>There you go, right there.
Go back up a little bit.</i>

325
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,716
<i>Okay, right there.</i>

326
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,273
<i>All right, guys,
we're gonna go in ten, nine...</i>

327
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,942
Is it starting?

328
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,736
Hey.
Hey.

329
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,279
Four,

330
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,864
three,

331
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,282
two,

332
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,202
and ready one,
take one.

333
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,122
There he is!

334
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,793
Not the best angle.

335
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:36,432
This is exciting.

336
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:39,601
Oh, my God,
is that what I think it is?

337
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,187
I think so.
A little morning chubby.

338
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,022
Damn it.

339
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,323
Oh, no.

340
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,753
Oh, honey.

341
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,004
Don't do that.

342
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,131
Pull it out.
Pull it out.

343
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:14,720
Well, that's
embarrassing.

344
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:17,973
<i>Good morning.</i>

345
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,563
Microphone.
Mmm-hmm.

346
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,899
Microphone.

347
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,361
Turn on the TV.

348
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,451
<i>Good morning.</i>

349
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:40,579
<i>I'm Ed.</i>

350
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,664
There's that smile!

351
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,222
<i>Ow, ow, ow!</i>

352
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,973
<i>- Hot!</i>
- An action sequence.

353
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,227
<i>I kind of pieced
this stereo together.</i>

354
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,520
<i>You know, kind of
a homemade job.</i>

355
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,356
<i>This is my wall of chrome.</i>

356
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,734
<i>I've been collecting
those since, like, 1973.</i>

357
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,238
Shit.

358
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:21,787
Oh, wow!

359
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:26,041
What'd I miss?

360
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,335
He's, uh, checking
out his own ass.

361
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:29,795
You gotta see this.

362
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,758
Oh, my God!

363
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:36,552
Oh!

364
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:54,987
Hey!

365
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,372
Come on, man,
hop in.

366
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,249
Let's go!

367
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,255
Whoa!

368
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:14,756
All right.

369
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,807
The mast is down.

370
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,602
Let's go, Sam, let's go!

371
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,784
Hey, Ed!
Ed, up here!

372
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,120
Guys, film me.
Yeah, hi!

373
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,872
Ed, up here! Yeah!

374
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,916
Ah!

375
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,834
Hey!

376
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,712
Act like
everything is normal.

377
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,505
Go. Go.

378
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,183
What's up, man?

379
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,269
Guys.

380
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,688
Welcome to work, Ed.

381
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:16,693
It's good to be
at work, Lou.

382
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,280
I got just
what you need
right here, boys.

383
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,867
The best tape in
the whole damn store.
<i>Smokey and the Bandit.</i>

384
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,077
Huh!

385
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,245
Who's in that?

386
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:31,166
Burton Leon Reynolds, Jr.
is in that, boys.

387
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,919
Burton Leon
Reynolds, Jr.?
Who?

388
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,712
Get out.

389
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,423
You can't have
this tape. Go home!

390
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,426
Get your raggedy little
Steven Seagal-loving
asses out of here.

391
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,220
"Who's in this?"
Burt Reynolds!

392
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:48,725
Burt.

393
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,186
<i>Burt rules.</i>

394
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,563
Alice,
why are we watching this?

395
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,649
No reason. I just want
to see what happens.

396
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,401
Well, let me spare
you the suspense, okay?

397
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,153
Absolutely nothing's
gonna happen, all right?
Trust me on this.

398
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,700
<i>Yeah.
Which one of these albums
would you recommend?</i>

399
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,494
<i>You gotta go
with that. Yeah.</i>

400
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,664
<i>Ah! That's a good
choice right there.</i>

401
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,582
I think he's cute.

402
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:19,381
No, no, no.

403
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,049
You look at
your husband, okay?
Get.

404
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,592
I'm gonna make you say
my name tonight, woman.

405
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,263
You know, most people
like to hurry through
a toenail clipping session.

406
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,557
You know, just clip
and git, you know.

407
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,934
Not me. Uh-huh.

408
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,437
I like to take my time.

409
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,233
I'm meticulous,
you know.

410
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:39,943
I like to do it.

411
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,487
<i>Yeah.</i>

412
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,574
You know, if this guy
collects his toe cheese,
I'm out of here.

413
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:49,244
<i>...then head down
to the little toe.
That ain't me.</i>

414
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,705
<i>I save the big one...</i>

415
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,959
<i>For last.</i>

416
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,627
<i>'Cause it's bigger,
you know.</i>

417
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:00,380
<i>You gotta do some work.
You gotta be an artiste.</i>

418
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,300
<i>Look at that.</i>

419
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,303
<i>Oh!</i>

420
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,348
No. No, I haven't seen
the spot ratings.

421
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,893
<i>You know how you're
watching the big game</i>

422
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,311
<i>and you gotta do
your business?</i>

423
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,860
Yeah. Well, that's
a number that, you know,
we'll hopefully build from.

424
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:26,031
<i>I don't have to anymore.
Check that out.
I designed this.</i>

425
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:29,576
No, I disagree.
No, I don't think it's
time to pull the plug.

426
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,203
<i>Can you back up to
your right a little bit?</i>

427
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,872
Yes, Mr. Whitaker,
I know they shoot horses.

428
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,541
<i>What do you see?
What is that?</i>

429
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:41,213
<i>That is the TV.
And where am I?
I am on the can.</i>

430
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:45,342
<i>At the same time,
I am on the can, but
yet I am still a fan.</i>

431
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,886
But you know what,
it's been one day, okay?

432
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:49,930
Can you give me
a week with this guy,

433
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:53,058
and then you fly up
my nose? Hello?

434
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:56,520
<i>Somebody smart said,
"Practicality wins out."</i>

435
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:02,317
<i>So, in this bathroom,
I'm a winner.</i>

436
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,861
<i>Yeah.</i>

437
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,655
<i>Five.</i>

438
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:08,990
Six.

439

Seven.

440
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,412
Eight.

441
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:19,126
<i>Come on, Ray,
she's not that heavy.</i>

442
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,467
You shifted
your weight.

443
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,970
I'm not hurt.
I'm not hurt.
I'm okay.

444
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,431
<i>Ray's Gym!
Now accepting applications!</i>

445
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:37,185
We want your body! Ray's!
Look what he did for me. Huh?

446
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,645
All right.

447
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:46,153
What do you like about it?
I don't understand.

448
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,989
I don't know.
It's just that
it's... Well...

449
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:50,615
Just let me watch.

450
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,243
<i>Okay, you're gonna love this.
This is a great story.</i>

451
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,870
<i>I got a great story, okay?</i>

452
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,248
<i>You remember Marcia?
Of course you remember
Marcia. She's our sister.</i>

453
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,626
<i>No, you know,
she's going out
with this new guy.</i>

454
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:02,961
<i>They're living together.</i>

<i>Ray, you want to save
this till later, man?</i>

456
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,424
<i>No, now's
the perfect time.</i>

457
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:09,342
He's a singer
in a piano bar.

458
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:11,928
Sings, plays the piano,
and that's how they met.

459
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,805
He sang to her,
they fell in love.

460
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,099
Not even, Buzz. No, no.

461
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:20,061
Get this. Some drunk
hit him in the head
with a snifter.

462
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,397
<i>You know, one of
those things they keep
on the bar for tips.</i>

463
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,065
<i>You don't know, Buzz,
'cause you never get
any tips.</i>

464
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,652
<i>But he hit him over the head
'cause he's terrible,
he's wretched,</i>

465
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:30,947
<i>he's awful,
he's dreadful, he sucks.
I'm telling you, right?</i>

466
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,199
So that's what happened.

467
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,202
She's pulling out
a chunk of glass
out of his skull,

468
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,288
and he bleeds on her,
and that's all she needs!

469
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,248
Bing! It's <i>amour,</i> right?

470
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,126
The question
I'm asking is,

471
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,004
"What's she doing in a bar
in the first place?"

472
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,797
<i>She's an alcoholic,
for Christ's sakes.</i>

473
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:51,968
No. No, no, Ray.
Ray, buddy, not here.
Come on now.

474
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,095
I gotta pee.
I gotta pee.

475
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,935
Hey, what are you,
hiding from the police
or something?

476
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,896
Come on, show yourself.
Look, is she beautiful?

477
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,314
She's beautiful, right?

478
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,024
<i>That's my girl.
Listen.</i>

479
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:09,069
While I'm gone, Ed,
tell 'em about that time
that we lied to Mom,

480
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:12,072
<i>and then we went down
to Tijuana to find
the donkey show.</i>

481
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,202
I got her.
I got her.

482
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,206
You are, though.

483
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,125
What?

484
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,378
Beautiful.

485
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:33,969
Thank you.
Hey, man.

486
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,470
You're welcome.
Yeah, buddy?

487
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:39,474
I'm taking a poll
on whether or not
I should shave my head.

488
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:43,687
<i>Um, I've had about 19 beers,
so take that into account.</i>

489
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:46,439
Hey, Barry,
did you see that?
What?

490
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:49,442
The girl. The look.
Yeah.

491
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:52,237
She likes the Ed guy better
than she likes the brother.

492
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:55,949
No,
I don't think I like it.
I don't think it's nice.

493
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,702
Yeah, it's a good set
of hair you got on
your head right now.

494
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,121
All right,
I had about enough of this.
Give me the remote.

495
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:03,373
Just a few more minutes.
Read your book.

496
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,742
Not this morning.
Mmm-mmm.

497
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,368
<i>Let's change topics
for a moment.</i>

498
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,412
<i>Does anybody have
an opinion or viewpoint</i>

499
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,081
<i>on something going
on now called</i> Ed TV?

500
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,458
<i>Oh!</i>

501
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,461
<i>This is a new low point
in American culture.</i>

502
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,713
<i>You're being kind.
Way too kind.
Oh!</i>

503
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,356
<i>Brushing my teeth.</i>

504
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,943
<i>They never bothered
to pick a guy
with any talent.</i>

505
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:15,570
<i>Or even anything to say.</i>

506
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,199
<i>They seem to celebrate
the fact that
the guy's a boob.</i>

507
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:22,452
<i>Sort of bit of
a joyous celebration of
boobery. That's what it is.</i>

508
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:25,497
Take it easy.

509
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,210
Hey,
Ed, your show stinks.

510
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:34,631
Hey, Ed,
you want my autograph?
Yeah!

511
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,592
Okey-dokey.

512
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,935
$10?

513
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,438
You're telling me
now you want $10
to walk my dog?

514
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,234
Listen, we had a deal,
you little
8-year-old bastard.

515
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,987
I'll tell you what.
Keep the dog.

516
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,283
Who is it?

517
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,078
Yeah, who is it?
It's me, Ed, buddy.

518
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:09,040
Ed? Just kidding.
How you doing?

519
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,875
Good, man. You ready
to watch the game?

520
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:14,087
Actually, no.
I'm a little bit sleepy.

521
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,005
I'm tired,
I'm exhausted,
I'm spent.

522
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,633
What are you talking about
being sleepy, buddy?
Five minutes to tip-off.

523
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,844
It's time for
Rocket ball, bruh!

524
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,679
Ray, where do you
keep the glasses?

525
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:26,433
Shari's here.
Why didn't you
just say so?

526
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,184
Huh?

527
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,687
- Hi, Shari.
- Who's Shari?

528
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:33,940
Who's that?

529
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,945
Okay. Oh, God. Oh, God.

530
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,823
You want me to get that?
No, I got it.
Ed, don't go, I...

531
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:42,991
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

532
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,909
Look at that!
Get in on that!

533
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,036
<i>No, no, honey.
It's not what you think.</i>
Oh, man!

534
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,206
You're being
misled by a manipulating
medium called television.

535
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,208
All right,
let's get out.
Out, out, out.

536
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,335
No, no, she's
a homeless girl.
Ed, don't leave.

537
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,421
And she was out
on the street,
and so I...

538
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:59,632
She didn't have any clothes
or a place to stay, and I...
Honey?

539
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:01,593
Oh, shit! Ed?

540
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:03,011
What do you
mean "homeless"?

541
00:30:03,094 --> 00:30:05,263
My place is better
than this dump.

542
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,182
Dump?
What?

543
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:10,018
That was Shari on the phone.
She saw the whole thing on TV.

544
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:11,728
And I gotta tell you,
she's pissed.

545
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,897
Well, no shit, Ray.
Who's the girl?

546
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,525
<i>Come here a second.</i>

547
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,862
<i>She's the receptionist
at the place where I buy
all that gym equipment.</i>

548
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,366
And she's a real knockout
and a redhead to boot,
which I've never had.

549
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,495
And she's never
given me the time of day.
Suddenly, today, she's all,

550
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,955
"Hey, I saw you
on TV last night,
and you were great."

551
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,793
And I'm all, "You know,
I just made some ginger root
gazpacho, come on over."

552
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,462
And the next thing
you know, ba-da-bing!

553
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:38,671
I mean, I'm human.

554
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,715
Come on, Ray.
What do you mean?
Why didn't you stop?

555
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,550
Stop?

556
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,762
Yeah, why didn't you stop?
I'm the guy. I don't stop.

557
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,265
That's the woman's job.
We're the gas,
they're the brakes.

558
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:56,147
<i>Go talk to Shari.
Honey, let him come
talk to you, okay?</i>

559
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:57,232
<i>Why? Why me?</i>

560
00:30:57,607 --> 00:30:59,859
Because you brought
the cameras here.

561
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,110
You brought the girl.

562
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:04,364
Oh! Oh, is that the way
it is, bro, huh? Huh?

563
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,533
You can't do me that
one little, simple favor?

564
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,369
Great. Okay.
I don't need any
favors from you!

565
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,996
Matter of fact,
PS, go to hell!

566
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,085
Freaking out of
his gourd, man.

567
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:21,047
Hey, Ed, man, come on,
you know I really need this.
I need this.

568
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,132
Listen, if I go over
there, you know
they're coming with me.

569
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:25,760
Yeah, and if I go over
there, she's gonna put
my balls in a blender.

570
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,095
<i>You know
you would, honey.</i>

571
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:30,515
And so all I'm asking
is just go talk to her
and beg her.

572
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:33,268
Beg her if you have...
Actually, honey,
let him come beg you.

573
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,103
<i>Just let him come beg you.</i>

574
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:37,146
And you owe me.

575
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,898
I owe you?
You know you owe me.

576
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,359
<i>I owe you? I owe you?
You owe me.</i>

577
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:42,735
Yes, go!

578
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,949
I can't go on about this.
"I owe you, you owe me."

579
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:52,704
Look, I have a guest.
I'm being rude, all right?
I'll talk to you.

580
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,164
Thanks, honey. Okay.

581
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,173
Yeah, Phil,
are you watching this?

582
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,135
Well, you might want
to take a look.

583
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:10,263
Jack, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

584
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,931
Don't shush me.

585
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,063
<i>Hi!</i>

586
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,859
<i>Hi, I'm Rita.
I'm Shari's roommate.</i>

587
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:24,944
Hey, Rita, I'm Ed.

588
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,155
Shari knew
you were coming over
because she saw...

589
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:28,489
- The cameras, yeah.
- Yeah.

590
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:31,284
She really doesn't want you
and the cameras up here
right now.

591
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,161
Right. Um...

592
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,247
Well, at least,
how's she doing?

593
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,124
I...

594
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,210
I gave her a drink.
I thought...

595
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,464
But she's not much of
a drinker, so it's made her
a little...

596
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,883
What do you want?
Belligerent.

597
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:48,760
Hey, Shari.

598
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,971
Listen, I'm real sorry
about all this.

599
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:53,806
Can I come up?

600
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,601
Come on, Shari.

601
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,227
Look, I know it's real awkward
with the cameras and all,

602
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,397
but let me come up
for a couple of seconds
and say two words, would you?

603
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,650
Shari, come on,
would you?

604
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,486
I'm getting really wet
down here. Can I come up?

605
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,282
All right,
here we go, Carlos.

606
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,159
Just stay with him.
Stay with him.

607
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:16,037
Hang on, Mike.

608
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:18,581
<i>Am I set?</i>
Yeah, you're
hard-wired, Mike.

609
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,671
Hi.
Hey.

610
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,465
Thanks for
letting me up.
Sure.

611
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,926
Hey, Shari.

612
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:34,889
<i>I'm going to go
to bed. Good night.</i>
Did I miss anything?

613
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,307
Good night.

614
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,101
Hi, Mom.

615
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:49,404
Ray feels...
Oh, don't defend
that horse's ass to me!

616
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,782
I'm not. I'm not
defending him, Shari. I...

617
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,328
Look, I'm just saying,
maybe this is a good thing.

618
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,123
I mean, he got it out
of his system, right?

619
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:01,791
He knows
it's not worth it.

620
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:05,378
<i>So now one day
if you two decide to get
married or something.</i>

621
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:08,798
<i>I've got news for you.</i>

622
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:13,052
<i>I never intended
to marry him.</i>

623
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,139
<i>Why?</i>

624
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,975
Well,
for one thing,

625
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,228
he's a bad lay!

626
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,943
<i>I mean bad!</i>

627
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,700
You tell him, sister!
You tell him!

628
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,662
Oh, you know
that's terrible.

629
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,330
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

630
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,542
<i>Hey, Shari.</i>

631
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,170
<i>You happy now, Ray?</i>

632
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:50,506
Listen, I think
you're pissed off at him
and you're hurt, you know.

633
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,633
And you're trying
to get back at Ray.

634
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:54,594
Don't you think?

635
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:57,513
Yeah, you're right.

636
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,685
- It's me. It's me!
- It's always me!

637
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:08,357
I go out with
all different kinds
of guys

638
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,943
and the same thing
keeps happening!

639
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:12,945
I mean, look,
you know what? Look.

640
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:15,114
See these magazines?
I take these quizzes,
right?

641
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:17,200
"How Are You at
Relationships?"

642
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,832
I cheat, okay?
I look in the back
for the answers.

643
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:29,504
<i>I mean, Rita says men
suck and they should
all die, you know.</i>

644
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:34,091
Then she eats a pound cake.
I mean, she's crazy,
but she's not confused.

645
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:39,347
Me, I examine
every little thing.

646
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,681
I mean, you know,
I'm just like this.

647
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,896
<i>- Shari.
- What?</i>

648
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,400
You're way too terrific of
a person to be doing this
to yourself. You are.

649
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,658
I mean, hey, I've told
Ray a couple of times,

650
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:02,495
I think you are one of
the best and smartest

651
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,957
and most attractive women
that I have ever met.

652
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,208
I mean that.

653
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:15,424
Really?
Yeah, really.

654
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:21,430
<i>There is nothing wrong
with you.</i>

655
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:24,684
Uh-oh.

656
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:36,153
Kiss him! Kiss him!

657
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:37,947
Don't do it, Ed.

658
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:42,743
Don't you kiss her.
Don't you kiss her.

659
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:49,000
God!

660
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,462
I'm nuts, huh?
Ha! I told him.

661
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,381
Yes! Yes! I win!

662
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:59,635
Oh, Whitaker, you schmuck,
I am the golden goddess of
television!

663
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,229
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

664
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,654
Yes, you're on television.
You're on television.

665
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:21,407
Oh, my God!

666
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:22,950
Oh!

667
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,368
God!

668
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:27,079
Oh, wow.

669
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:30,541
Listen, Shari?
It's okay.

670
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:33,252
I just kissed
my boyfriend's brother
on television!

671
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:34,503
How is that okay?

672
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,964
Well,
when you put it that way,
no, it's not ideal.

673
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:39,216
Please go. Go!
Let's just talk...

674
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,261
All right.
We're out of here, guys.
Come on, she's right.

675
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:45,014
Son of a bitch.
What the hell
just happened?

676
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,141
Hey! Hey!

677
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,019
Come on, Ed,
you can't do this to me!

678
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,562
We're locked out!
We're locked out!

679
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,280
Oh, no, no, Carlos,
you're killing me!
Just shoot the door.

680
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:02,531
I got Mike up on the roof.

681
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,700
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

682
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,038
What are we doing?

683
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:14,877
I've got to tell you
something, Shari.
What?

684
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,547
I've had a big thing for you
for months, Shari.

685
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:19,632
Really?
Yeah.

686
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:23,386
I mean, I've been seeing
you going out with Ray
and you being his girlfriend,

687
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,555
and the whole time
I was wishing
you were my girlfriend.

688
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:28,766
See, me, too!

689
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:34,146
I am going out with Ray,
and all I can think about
is you.

690
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,241
I treated you like a princess!

691
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:48,244
<i>- Oh, this is so weird.
- Yeah, it is weird.</i>

692
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:55,084
Oh, I gotta go.

693
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:15,354
<i>¿ Uno más?</i>

694
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,294
Ray? Oh, hey, Al.
Hey, you seen Ray?
Is he around?

695
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,671
Hey, I'm on
television!
Yeah.

696
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:43,049
<i>Ray was here,
but he left when he saw
you were coming over.</i>

697
00:39:43,174 --> 00:39:46,135
Shit.
Hey, that was some night
last night, kiddo.

698
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:48,971
Yeah, it damn sure was, Al.

699
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,348
All right,
how about Mom?
Is she around?

700
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:52,516
She's here.
She's in the bedroom.

701
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,186
I'd yell for her,
but I'd die.

702
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,897
Don't do that. Mom!

703
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:01,776
I'm right here, darling.
There's no need to shout.

704
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,694
That's not how
you were brought up.

705
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:05,738
Mom, what are you doing?

706
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:09,533
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to my home.

707
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,161
- Blanche DuBois lives.
<i>- Mom, Mom.</i>

708
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:14,371
I'm looking for Ray.
Listen, I've been calling him.

709
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:15,956
He won't call me back.
You know where
I can find him?

710
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:19,376
How could
you do something like that?
Your own brother's girlfriend.

711
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,878
It's not all my fault.
He cheated on her.

712
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:23,756
<i>Well,
it was a mistake.</i>
<i>Yes, it was a mistake.</i>

713
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,508
<i>Do you know where he is?</i>

714
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,135
No. Maybe he's watching.

715
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:31,597
Tell him you're sorry,
tell him that you will
stay away from that girl.

716
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,433
No, Ma! And that girl
has a name, okay?

717
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,185
What, do you love her
or something?

718
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:41,023
<i>- Come on, Al.
- Look at that red face.</i>

719
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:42,775
<i>I had a car that color.
A Buick!</i>

720
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,401
Aren't you excited?

721
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:46,695
He practically said
he loved you
on television.

722
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:47,863
I know.

723
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:50,116
<i>Hi.
Hi, girls.</i>

724
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,291
<i>Wait. Take my picture.
Here, take my picture.</i>

725
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,543
<i>Go ahead, take
my picture with him.</i>

726
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:03,963
<i>I gotta go to work.
You understand that?</i>

727
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:09,176
I am really gonna
get hurt this time.

728
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,553
<i>There we go, girls.</i>

729
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:13,347
<i>I'm going to work. Bye.</i>

730
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:16,350
Yeah, Doc, I stopped
payment on the plugs.

731
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,727
You gave me doll hair!

732
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:20,896
I'll hold.

733
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:23,065
<i>Bye!</i>

734
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:28,028
Okay, now I'll tell
you something else.
Yeah.

735
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:30,948
The old guy in
the wheelchair,
the stepfather?

736
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:32,158
Yeah.

737
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:33,659
They're gonna
have him die.

738
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,248
Well, that was Whitaker
on the phone.

739
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm gonna have
to go scrub my ass

740
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,710
because he's on his way
over to kiss it.

741
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,961
Hey!

742
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:48,382
Hey, bring it on in,
buddy. Bring it on in.

743
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:50,885
That's right,
come on.

744
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:55,514
A little further. Come on.
All right, perfect, man.
Perfect.

745
00:41:57,391 --> 00:41:58,893
Oh, I got my own
parking spot now?

746
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,603
It's all for you, Ed.

747
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:02,813
How's it going, man?
Good, Mark, how are you?

748
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,106
Come on inside.

749
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,817
Thanks, man.
Ed, you're the best, man.

750
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,861
Saw you last night.
Looking good, man.
All right.

751
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:09,945
Hey, Ed.

752
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:13,824
Oh, Ray, man.
I've been looking all
over for you, buddy.

753
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:17,369
Listen, man,
I know I got some
explaining to do.

754
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:19,622
Just let me do what
I came here to do.

755
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,457
What, do you want
to fight?

756
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:26,545
Cassie, come on.

757
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,756
This is really hard.
You promised.

758
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:30,132
Wait, what are you doing, Ray?

759
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:33,761
Go ahead.

760
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:37,556
<i>I went out with Ray
a few years ago,</i>

761
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,975
<i>for a couple of months,</i>

762
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,478
<i>and we were intimate.</i>

763
00:42:44,188 --> 00:42:48,442
And he's really not
as bad as that girl
said he was.

764
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:52,488
I mean, I've
definitely had worse.
That's enough.

765
00:42:53,072 --> 00:42:54,990
I think we did
what we came here for.
Wow.

766
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:59,119
Goodbye, brother.
No, come on, Ray!

767
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:00,579
Vindicated!

768
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:03,832
Ray, what are you...

769
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,252
<i>Okay, I'm in the bathroom.
Go ahead.</i>

770
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,087
Ed, sorry
we're calling you so late.

771
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,798
It's just that this is
the only time we get to
talk to you off camera.

772
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:12,675
<i>No, it's cool,
Cynthia, I was up.</i>

773
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,052
Ed, why didn't you
go see Shari today, man?

774
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:17,054
That's what everybody
was hoping you'd do.

775
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:19,014
<i>Well, you know, I mean,
I wanted to, but...</i>

776
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:22,226
Is it about Ray?
Because Ray is
not a problem.

777
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,477
And he cheated on Shari.

778
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,606
That's right, Ed.
Viewers don't like Ray.
The research says females...

779
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,651
No, hey, guys,
it's not Ray. Okay?

780
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,861
<i>Hey, Cynthia?</i>

781
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:34,154
Yes, Ed?

782
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,116
<i>You got a second?
Can I talk to you
alone for a second?</i>

783
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:39,618
Absolutely. Yeah.
Why don't you guys
take off?

784
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:41,912
I'll see you all
in the morning.
Okay. I'll talk to...

785
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,832
Okay, see you later.
All right,
I'll see you later.

786
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:47,001
Goodbye. All right.
See you later.

787
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:51,547
Ed, how's it going?

788
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:56,135
I'm good, you know. I'm good.
Everything's cool.

789
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:59,221
Did you decide
you don't really like
Shari that much?

790
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:02,933
No! No, no, no.
That's not it at all.

791
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:05,728
<i>Oh, I like Shari plenty,
okay? I mean, Shari is...</i>

792
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:08,105
<i>Oh, man, Shari's great.</i>

793
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:10,232
Yeah?

794
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:15,154
Look, Cynthia,
how's this gonna work?

795
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,115
I mean, what,
are we gonna date on TV?
She's not gonna like that.

796
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:19,199
You know, and I...

797
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:22,036
Ed, if you don't call her,
you're not really giving her
a choice.

798
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,120
<i>Okay.</i>

799
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:25,581
Ed?
What?

800
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:28,334
Can I give you some
advice about women?

801
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:29,460
<i>Sure.</i>

802
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:33,464
Women want
to be pursued.

803
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,924
Yes, but...

804
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:37,885
<i>Ed?</i>
Huh?

805
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,387
What would Burt do?

806
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:59,239
Oh, this is so exciting.
A real celebrity
delivering my figs.

807
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:01,700
Yeah. Okay, if you would
just sign right here, please.

808
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:06,121
Ray's a pig.
That Ed is a doll.
You latch onto him, honey.

809
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,874
Okay. Please sign right
there in the black area.

810
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:11,919
You know, it wouldn't
kill you to use a little
more makeup on television.

811
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:13,545
You look a little
washed out.

812
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:15,881
Okay. What do I actually
have to do to get you to
sign this?

813
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:20,344
Uh-huh. On television
a minute, and already
you got an attitude.

814
00:45:22,513 --> 00:45:23,555
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

815
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:28,227
Hi.

816
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:32,648
What are you doing?
I missed you.

817
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:34,525
Really?

818
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:37,027
Uh...

819
00:45:43,409 --> 00:45:44,451
Wow.

820
00:45:44,535 --> 00:45:46,495
I've never seen you
in uniform before.

821
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:47,913
Yeah, well.

822
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:49,957
It's really
quite a turnoff.

823
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,335
Thank you.

824
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:57,631
Listen, Sunday night
at the Sharks game,

825
00:45:57,714 --> 00:45:58,966
I'm gonna be driving
the Zamboni.

826
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:00,092
The what?

827
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,302
You now,
that big machine that
cleans the ice, you know.

828
00:46:02,386 --> 00:46:03,971
Uh-huh.
It's quite an honor.

829
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:07,307
Will you go with me?

830
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:17,860
Look, I know
this is weird,
Shari, but...

831
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:21,238
I don't want to wait.

832
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,198
I don't.

833
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:25,784
I really think we might
have something here.

834
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,662
Don't you?

835
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:38,255
Oh, these are for you.
Thank you.

836
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:42,968
So, will you be
my Zamboni date?

837
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:44,887
Huh?

838
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:48,182
Yes.
All right.

839
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,895
Yes!

840
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:58,567
Cynthia, this is great.
This is exploitable!
This is perfect.

841
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:00,486
Yeah, well...

842
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:06,074

Where's my girl?
There she is!

- Hey, it's Ed!

860
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:23,860
Good evening, Ken.
How's it going?

861

How's it going?

He's Menudo!

872
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:53,140
Hey, Shari, lucky lady!
I want to be on TV with you.

873
00:48:53,223 --> 00:48:55,559
Look right over there
at that monitor.

874
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,686
Stop it!
Who do you think you are?

875
00:48:58,854 --> 00:48:59,855
Stop it!

Shari!

Shari!

00:49:09,698 --> 00:49:11,867
Hold on, I got you.
Back off!

You okay, babe?

880
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:23,337
<i>Okay,
we're gonna take
a break now.</i>

881
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,885
Are you okay?
Mmm-hmm.

882
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:35,057
Wow. You went down.
I lost an earring.

883
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:38,060
You think you can
go out and get it?

884
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:41,647
Yeah, I'll get it.
No, no. Okay,
I'm just kidding.

885
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:46,193
You're kidding?
Just kidding.
Would you really do that?

886
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:50,739
<i>Yeah, I'd do that. I mean,
if you wanted your earring.</i>

887
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:21,603
Oh, wow. That's
the new camera truck, huh?

888
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:25,023
Look at
my enormous head.

889
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:27,943
Anyway, Cynthia,
last night,
that was scary.

890
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:29,111
Listen. Listen.
Don't worry that.

891
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,446
That won't happen again.
We're getting you security.

892
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:33,031
<i>Good.</i>

893
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:34,449
I have some news
for you.

894
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:36,201
<i>What's that?</i>

895
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:39,746
We're, uh, picking up
<i>Ed TV</i> for another month.

896
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:41,832
Whoa, say that again.

897
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,834
We're picking you up
for another month.

898
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:47,003
That means a balloon payment
and a big raise next month.

899
00:50:48,422 --> 00:50:50,716
You're telling me
that balloon payment,
I'm going to get that?

900
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:51,842
<i>Yeah.</i>

901
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:56,430
Here we go.

902
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:02,018
<i>Thank you! Oh, man!
This is so incredible.</i>

903
00:51:02,102 --> 00:51:03,687
<i>Cynthia, this is amazing!</i>

904
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:07,357
<i>Yes! Another month
and a balloon payment!</i>

905
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:09,192
<i>Ray! Ray,
if you're watching...</i>

906
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:10,610
Who the hell would be
watching this?

907
00:51:10,694 --> 00:51:11,903
<i>Did you hear this?
Did you hear this?</i>

908
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:14,322
<i>I got the payment, buddy.
I got the payment.
This money's for you!</i>

909
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:15,699
<i>All right? To pay back
that loan! Huh?</i>

910
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:18,160
<i>It's for you, brother!
Come on!</i>

911
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:20,162
<i>What do we do when
we're happy? What do we
do when we're happy?</i>

912
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:22,080
<i>Chicken dance, baby.
The chicken dance.</i>

913
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:23,373
<i>Huh?</i>

914
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,877
<i>Come on.
I know you're doing it
wherever you are, brother.</i>

915
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,212
If I was doing it,
I wouldn't do it like that.

916
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:31,465
<i>I'm on
for another month.</i>

917
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:47,564
Everybody back up,
please. Please!

918
00:51:52,194 --> 00:51:53,862
Please, clear
a path to the car.

919
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:06,833
<i>Four weeks ago,
no one in America had ever
heard of Ed Pekurny.</i>

920
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:09,419
<i>Today, this 31-year-old
video store clerk</i>

921
00:52:09,503 --> 00:52:13,799
<i>has become something of
an American icon,
a national obsession.</i>

922
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,217
<i>Honestly?</i>

923
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:19,971
<i>I try not to go
to the bathroom until Ed
goes to the bathroom,</i>

924
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:21,973
<i>so I don't miss anything.</i>

925
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:25,727
<i>I don't know.
The idea just came to me.</i>

926
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:27,354
Sure, it came to you,
because I brought it to you.

927
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:31,483
<i>You know, I'm not a guy
who works by committee.
I'm a one-man show.</i>

928
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:33,693
<i>What do you guys
think about Shari?</i>

929
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:35,695
<i>She's needy!
I don't like her.</i>

930
00:52:35,779 --> 00:52:38,323
<i>She's too tall.
It's, like, abnormal.</i>

931
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:40,200
<i>Yeah.
She creeps me out.</i>

932
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:42,327
<i>She's always,
"Get away! Get away!"</i>

933
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,329
<i>I mean, who does
she think she is?</i>

934
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,498
<i>I know! And she's so bony!</i>

935
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:49,709
<i>Oh, well, to me,
this Shari's like
nothing, right?</i>

936
00:52:49,793 --> 00:52:53,046
<i>She's not even hot.
I mean, Ed's a celebrity.</i>

937
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:55,632
<i>If that was me,
I'd be dating the goods.</i>

938
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:59,010
<i>There's like
something wrong with her.
She's definitely not hot.</i>

939
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:01,638
<i>Not hot, not hot. No way.</i>

940
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,098
<i>She is
a heat-free being.</i>

941
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,394
Hello? Hi, here you go.

942
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:09,563
Oh, hi. Yeah.
I've been waiting for this.
Thank you.

943
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:12,274
<i>Y'all watching</i>
Ed TV, <i>right?</i>
Sign right here, please.

944
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,693
<i>What's up with Shari?
You know,
Ed's girlfriend Shari?</i>

945
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:16,444
<i>What is up with that bitch?</i>

946
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,072
<i>Ed, honey, look.</i>

947
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:23,285
<i>Ed, when you get tired
of that skanky ho,</i>

948
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:25,036
<i>come see me, baby.</i>

949
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:39,551
Check out the moves!
Watch this one.

950
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:43,597
Oh, oh!
She's down.

951
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:45,599
Get out of here.

952
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:46,850
Shari!
Shari!

953
00:53:50,145 --> 00:53:53,607
Hi.
Come pile on!
Set down the groceries.

954
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,194
Come here!

955
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:00,780
Where are you going, baby?

956
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:05,660
No. We're not gonna
do it today, Shari.

957
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:07,287
I'm gonna go
and get ready.

958
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:10,498
Baby. Hey, is
everything all right?

959
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:14,127
No! My truck broke down,
and I got stuck in the rain.

960
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:16,796
I called the company,
and no one came to get me.

961
00:54:17,964 --> 00:54:19,841
- Rita!
- Just a second.

962
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:21,343
Don't they give you
a hat?

963
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:24,429
Some dorky kid stole it
as a souvenir.

964
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,765
Oh... That sucks.

965
00:54:27,766 --> 00:54:29,559
I got to tell you.
I'm kind of glad
he did, Shari,

966
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:32,020
'cause god damn
you look sexy.

967
00:54:34,356 --> 00:54:36,900
Ed, I don't want to be
on television anymore.

968
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:42,614
Shari, how's that
gonna work?

969
00:54:42,697 --> 00:54:44,532
I have been trying, okay?

970
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:54,042
But maybe we should
just hold off
on seeing each other

971
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,795
until you are done
with all of this.

972
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:03,510
You're out of
there, baby!

973
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,720
I knew it was
gonna happen, dude!
I told you!

974
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:07,389
Okay, that's a little
extreme, isn't it?

975
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:08,807
I can't take it
anymore, Ed.

976
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,558
I have no privacy.

977
00:55:10,684 --> 00:55:12,727
Oh...

978
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:16,690
I mean, even now I'm crying,
and I can't stop,
and they won't leave.

979
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:18,650
And now it's gonna
be another month!

980
00:55:18,775 --> 00:55:22,070
Everybody hates me.
Nobody hates you, baby.
Why are you...

981
00:55:22,612 --> 00:55:24,698
Who hates you?
A poll, Ed!

982
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,243
<i>USA Today</i> "Is Shari
good enough for Ed?"

983

71% of the people said no.

984
00:55:31,204 --> 00:55:33,665
Who cares what
they say, you know?
I don't care.

985
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:37,627
Well, you know, I do care.
You know what?
Shame on everybody!

986
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:40,380
She's crying over here,
and it's all your fault.

<i>At least the 71% of you.
The other...</i>

You're smart! See,
isn't she smart?
I mean...

991
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:54,853
God, she's sexy
with the wet hair
and everything.

992
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:56,604
And she's funny.
You know that?

993
00:55:56,688 --> 00:55:59,941
She's really funny, too.
She really is!

994
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:06,531
Shari, do that love coroner
skit that you did for me at
the pool hall that time.

995
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:10,660
It's so...great.
It's great. Okay?
Okay, baby? You set?

996
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,246
Okay, back up,
get a wide shot of this.
Get a wide shot. Okay.

997
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,831
All right, baby,
remember...

998
00:56:15,457 --> 00:56:16,583
That's the punch line,
all right?

999
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:17,876
You got a whole
runway over there.

1000
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:18,960
Come on,
are you set to pop?

1001
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:21,296
All right,
ones and twos, and
look right here.

1002
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,305
What are you doing?

1003
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:32,891
Do the thing.
Do, like, the skit.

1004
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:36,061
You want me
to entertain
your audience?

1005
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,441
What is this, Ed?
An audition to be
your girlfriend,

1006
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:43,902
because I'm not good
enough for you?

1007
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:48,615
No, Shari,
that's not it!
Come on, Shari!

1008
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:53,244
Psycho chick.
Damaged goods, bro.
Do not accept, man.

1009
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:57,332
Man, this is stupid.
"Is Shari good enough
for Ed?"

1010
00:56:57,415 --> 00:57:00,001
Who the hell am I, huh?
Who do you think
I should be dating?

1011
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:01,920
There's a list!

1012
00:57:03,546 --> 00:57:04,798
Really?

1013
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:17,685
Ed?

00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:22,607
God damn.

1015
00:57:23,817 --> 00:57:25,568
<i>Now, Ed,
the whole Shari thing,
is that over?</i>

1016

<i>You guys gonna be
showing up on
the History Channel?</i>

<i>What?
What's happening?</i>

1018
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,699
<i>No, we're just...
We're on hold.
On hold?</i>

1019
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:34,452
<i>What, is she a phone call?
Is she listening
to Yanni music?</i>

1020
00:57:34,536 --> 00:57:36,871
<i>You're gonna get back to her?
Who puts a woman on hold?</i>

1021
00:57:36,955 --> 00:57:38,206
<i>What is that all about?
No, we're just...</i>

1022
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:39,833
<i>You know, we're gonna
wait till this is over,</i>

1023
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,292
<i>and then we're gonna
pick it back up.</i>

1024
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:47,132
<i>I guess,
this is the famous Carlos
who follows you everywhere?</i>

1025
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,433
<i>You know what
I wanted to ask you,</i>

1026
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:58,977
<i>what is this
chicken dance thing?</i>

1027
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:01,521
<i>The chicken dance.
Y'all know
the chicken dance?</i>

1028
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:05,191
<i>Okay, so let's do it!</i>

1029
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:08,945
<i>Have I got it?
Is this how you do it?</i>

1030
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,282
<i>You gotta get
your butt out there.</i>
<i>This is a lot of fun.</i>

1031
00:58:12,365 --> 00:58:15,160
<i>Ed Pekurny! We'll be
right back, right after this.</i>

1032
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,832
Yeah,
yeah, thank you.

1033
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:22,500
Hey, can I have
another hat for my dad?

1034
00:58:22,584 --> 00:58:24,502
Ed, I've got your car
ready right here, man.
Cool.

1035
00:58:24,586 --> 00:58:26,671
Hey, can you get us
a couple of sodas for
the ride to the airport?

1036
00:58:26,754 --> 00:58:28,047
Yeah. What do you want?
Coke or Pepsi?

1037
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:29,549
Uh... Pepsi.

1038
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:31,217
Can I talk to you
for a second, man?
Yeah.

1039
00:58:31,968 --> 00:58:33,595
What's up?
My name is Shane.

1040
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,305
Hey, Shane.
What's this, man?
How you doing?

1041
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:36,556
This is a tape
of my band, man.

1042
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:39,434
I thought that maybe
you could play it on
your show.

1043
00:58:40,894 --> 00:58:42,187
Oh, man, come on.

1044
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:43,855
One of the guys
is blind.

1045
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:49,694
All right,
I'll give it a listen.

1046
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:52,071
Hey, the name of the band is
Not All Of Us Can See.

1047
00:58:52,155 --> 00:58:53,948
Really terrific name.
Not All Of Us Can See.

1048
00:58:54,032 --> 00:58:56,784
Not All Of You Can See.
What the hell is that, man?

1049
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,329
For the love of sweet...

1050
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:02,707
- Jesus Christ!
- Really.

1051
00:59:09,756 --> 00:59:11,049
Hi.
Hi.

1052
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,469
Um, I just wanted to say
I really love your show.

1053
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,763
- I think you're great.
- Oh, thank you.

1054
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,098
That's a really cool
thing to say. I'm Ed.

1055
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:21,726
And you must be John?

1056
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:25,647
I'm trying to remember,
all right.

1057
00:59:27,941 --> 00:59:30,818
Well, I'm Jill.
I'm from San Francisco, too.

1058
00:59:31,694 --> 00:59:34,781
Right. The Bay Area.
Yes, I can tell
by the accent.

1059
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,332
Oh, I'm just joshing you.

1060
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:47,001
So, what are you
doing here?

1061
00:59:47,669 --> 00:59:50,463
<i>Oh, well, I just flew down
to audition, um, for a skit.</i>

1062
00:59:50,964 --> 00:59:51,965
<i>All right.</i>

1063
00:59:53,341 --> 00:59:56,219
<i>I'm a model and sort
of an actress, so...</i>

1064
00:59:57,387 --> 00:59:58,388
<i>Um...</i>

1065
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,683
<i>It was really...
It was nice meeting you.</i>

1066
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,352
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
No, you, too.

1067
01:00:04,936 --> 01:00:05,937
Yeah.

1068
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,438
They were supposed
to send a car for me

1069
01:00:07,522 --> 01:00:09,399
to take me to
the airport, but, um...

1070
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,610
<i>I'll tell you what.
We got a...</i>

1071
01:00:12,694 --> 01:00:15,446
We're going to
the airport right now.
Got a limo outside.

1072
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:17,198
Why don't you...
Why don't you
ride with us?

1073
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:19,701
Oh. Yeah,
that'd be great.

1074
01:00:20,243 --> 01:00:22,078
Thanks.
You're welcome.

1075
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:24,872
All right.
All right.

1076
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:37,051
Excuse me.
Coming through.

1077
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:41,222
Take all
you want, man. It's free.

1078
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:45,393
Tawny.

1079
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:47,562
Oh...

1080
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:49,439
Hey, Carlos.

1081
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,733
These go in
the nude picture pile.

1082
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:53,818
What do we got here?

1083
01:00:56,863 --> 01:00:58,573
Oh, this is cute.

1084
01:00:59,282 --> 01:01:01,451
This goes in
the psychopath pile.

1085
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:03,411
Oh.

1086
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:06,122
<i>Hope it's not this guy.</i>

1087
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:07,999
<i>Be right there!</i>

1088
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:09,751
Hello.

1089
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:11,294
Hey, Moe,
what's going on?

1090
01:01:11,878 --> 01:01:13,963
Hey, Ed,
this guy says
he knows you.

1091
01:01:15,214 --> 01:01:16,674
Hey.
Hey.

1092
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:17,759
How you doing?

1093
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,725
You don't recognize me?

1094
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:28,269
Dad?

1095
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:30,772
Yeah. Yeah.

1096
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:37,236
Did you do this?
Did you find him?
No way.

1097
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,156
Come on... Come on in.

1098
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:41,783
Yeah, okay.

1099
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:43,368
God damn.

1100
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:45,703
<i>Everybody,
this is Hank,
he's, uh, my dad.</i>

1101
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:47,872
Oh, this just keeps
getting better, doesn't it?

1102
01:01:47,955 --> 01:01:50,792
So, what you're saying,
Ma, is that everything
he told me yesterday

1103
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,168
was a lie.
Yes.

1104
01:01:53,586 --> 01:01:54,587
Practically.

1105
01:01:57,632 --> 01:01:59,550
What do you mean
"practically," Ma?

1106
01:01:59,634 --> 01:02:02,303
Either you threw him
out or he ran away.
Which one is it?

1107
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:03,888
I need to replace
the coil.

1108
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:06,933
He ran away after
I threw him out.

1109
01:02:07,016 --> 01:02:09,727
How much is one
of those new coils?
150 bucks.

1110
01:02:09,811 --> 01:02:11,062
So, he was telling
the truth.

1111
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,313
Should I go ahead?

1112
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:15,108
Yes.
Yes to me, or yes
to the coil, Mom?

1113
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,360
Both.
Oh, shit.

1114
01:02:18,486 --> 01:02:20,321
Eddie, look,
he had girlfriends. Okay?

1115
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:22,240
He told me he had
this one girl...

1116
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:25,993
<i>I really do not need
to relive this on
national television.</i>

1117
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:27,078
<i>I am your mother.</i>

1118
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:29,580
Yes, you are.
Do not humiliate me
like this!

1119
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:30,915
I'm not trying
to humiliate you.

1120
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:32,667
I don't need this!
Go away!

1121
01:02:33,543 --> 01:02:34,669
Eddie?

1122
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,422
Make this one out
to Dr. Rumpley.

1123
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:39,841
Maybe this son of a bitch
won't keep me waiting an hour.

1124
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:42,510
Damn urologists think
they run the world.

1125
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:44,971
She does
this every time.

1126
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:48,808
All right. Do you want
to know the truth?
Yeah.

1127
01:02:49,183 --> 01:02:53,604
I took you and Ray
and Marcia to my sister's on
the train for the weekend.

1128
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:55,481
You all came down
with chicken pox,

1129
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,859
and so I took you home
a day early.

1130
01:02:57,942 --> 01:03:01,279
And, uh, I walked in,
and there was your father

1131
01:03:01,362 --> 01:03:03,739
with another woman
in our bed. Okay!

1132
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:08,369
Chicken pox.
Ma, I was six when
I had chicken pox,

1133
01:03:08,453 --> 01:03:10,288
and Dad didn't
leave until I was 12.

1134
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:12,123
Well, he apologized.

1135
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:13,916
<i>What do you mean
"he apologized, " Mom?</i>

1136
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,209
<i>He begged me.</i>

1137
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,171
<i>He got down
on his knees
and he begged me.</i>

1138
01:03:18,254 --> 01:03:20,631
<i>Well, Mom, you told me that
you had a hysterectomy</i>

1139
01:03:20,715 --> 01:03:23,050
<i>and that he ran off
with your nurse.</i>

1140
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:26,220
She could've been a nurse.

1141
01:03:26,304 --> 01:03:27,638
What do you mean,
could've been a nurse?

1142
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:29,474
She had white shoes.

1143
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:32,977
So does Grandma!
You know, so does
Shaquille O'Neal!

1144
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:36,147
That's good.
<i>Well,
what's the difference?</i>

1145
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,192
Mom, the difference is
that for 20 years I've
been thinking one thing

1146
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:42,236
and now it's turned out to
be a whole different thing!

1147
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,529
Eddie.

1148
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:47,450
He was no good to me.
Don't you remember
the way it was?

1149
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:50,786
Don't you remember
the way he used
to scream at me?

1150
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:53,581
And then no job was ever
good enough for him.

1151
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:54,916
"Small potatoes."

1152
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,418
"Small potatoes."
You remember, Al?

1153
01:04:01,714 --> 01:04:02,715
Al?

1154
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,264
Mom...

1155
01:04:11,224 --> 01:04:14,519
You told me
you didn't know Al
until after Dad left.

1156
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:20,566
Holy shit.

1157
01:04:22,985 --> 01:04:24,654
You and Al were...

1158
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:30,117
And that's why
you threw Dad out.
There it is!

1159
01:04:30,701 --> 01:04:33,412
Oh, finally the truth after
20 goddamn years, Mom?

1160
01:04:33,496 --> 01:04:36,165
He had another woman
in my bed, Eddie!

1161
01:04:36,499 --> 01:04:39,544
And how dare
you call him "Dad"
in front of Al.

1162
01:04:39,627 --> 01:04:41,170
Al is your father.

1163
01:04:41,671 --> 01:04:43,506
This is the one
who was there for you

1164
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:45,341
when you really
needed someone.
Ow!

1165
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,301
You're hurting me.

1166
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,181
Oh, Mom.

1167
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:57,228
Don't blame your mother.
I was irresistible.

1168
01:05:09,574 --> 01:05:11,075
Come on in.

1169
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:12,618
How are you doing?

1170
01:05:12,785 --> 01:05:15,037
All right.
All right.

1171
01:05:16,706 --> 01:05:17,873
You?

1172
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:20,042
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. I'm fine.

1173
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:25,798
<i>I guess you came up here
to check on your inheritance,
did you?</i>

1174
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:32,430
Come right over here.
You sit right down there.

1175
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:33,514
There you go.

1176
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:35,850
All right. Thank you.
Yeah.

1177
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:39,645
Well, this is, uh,

1178
01:05:39,729 --> 01:05:41,689
quite a shithole,
ain't it?

1179
01:05:42,982 --> 01:05:45,693
Oh, it could be,
if you fixed it up.

1180
01:05:48,279 --> 01:05:49,614
Jeanette, you better
take a look at this.

1181
01:05:49,697 --> 01:05:50,948
Coming.

1182
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:52,658
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

1183
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:56,162
<i>You know, it is really nice
of you to come up here.</i>

1184
01:05:57,413 --> 01:06:00,916
<i>You know, a million times
I wanted to see you kids,
but, um, well</i>

1185
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,337
<i>I mean, your mom,
she told me to stay away.</i>

1186
01:06:05,421 --> 01:06:07,757
<i>And I had to respect
her wishes.</i>

1187
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:13,554
Can I ask you something?
Anything.

1188
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:19,894
What happened, Pop?
I mean...

1189
01:06:22,229 --> 01:06:24,815
How'd you end up
like this?

1190
01:06:24,899 --> 01:06:27,068
Well, you know,
life is funny,
that's all.

1191
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:30,071
I mean, I can't tell
you how many times if

1192
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:32,990
just one little thing
that I needed
would've happened...

1193
01:06:33,074 --> 01:06:36,410
Well, everything
would've changed.
I'll tell you that.

1194
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:38,704
But, I don't
make excuses.

1195
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:40,581
And I don't hold grudges.

1196
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:43,751
You and me, we had
some good times together,
though, didn't we? Huh?

1197
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:50,508
Remember the time that
we drove down to Houston
for the weekend

1198
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:53,052
<i>and we saw the Astros
and the Dodgers play?</i>

1199
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:56,138
We stayed in a motel,
it was just you and me.

1200
01:06:57,264 --> 01:06:59,350
And you hopped
from bed to bed.

1201
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:02,937
Hell, I remember
that just like
it was yesterday.

1202
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:06,816
I remember
everything you said
and everything you did.

1203
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:11,153
That was Ray, Pop.
Hmm?

1204
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,198
<i>You took
Ray to Houston.</i>

1205
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:18,244
<i>It wasn't me.
I had to stay home
with Mom and Marcia.</i>

1206
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:23,749
<i>That's right. Ray.</i>

1207
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:26,293
Ray was
the older one.

1208
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:27,962
Still is.

1209
01:07:31,716 --> 01:07:32,800
<i>Yeah.</i>

1210
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:36,220
Well...

1211
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:38,472
<i>Isn't
that something?</i>

1212
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:40,516
<i>Damn the mind!</i>

1213
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:43,394
You know, I gotta go, Pop.

1214
01:07:43,477 --> 01:07:45,104
I got a thing across
town I gotta get to.

1215
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:46,772
Sure, son.
Sure. Sure.

1216
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:54,655
You know what?
All right. Listen.

1217
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:56,574
This is my pop.
All right?

1218
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,118
<i>And if there's
anybody out there
that can help him out</i>

1219
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,203
<i>I don't know,
get him a job
or something.</i>

1220
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:03,205
<i>I drove a limo
for a while.</i>

1221
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:06,167
I'll help you out.
All right? I'll mention
your business on the air...

1222
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,877
I don't have
a valid license, Ed.

1223
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,796
<i>We'll figure
something out.
All right?</i>

1224
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:15,092
All right.
Ed.

1225
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:17,678
Yeah.

1226
01:08:19,346 --> 01:08:21,015
I am truly sorry.

1227
01:08:29,565 --> 01:08:32,026
That's good, Pop.
Sorry's good.

1228
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:25,079
<i>As soon as
we're perpendicular to Earth,
I'll start the engines again.</i>

1229
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:26,664
<i>What about the disk?</i>

1230
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,924
Oh, God. All right, all right.

1231
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,562
Hi.
Hi.

1232
01:09:53,107 --> 01:09:55,276
They're not here.
How's that?

1233
01:09:56,944 --> 01:09:58,112
Well, I snuck out.

1234
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:03,909
Do you want
to take a drive?

1235
01:10:05,578 --> 01:10:06,745
Sure.
Okay.

1236
01:10:07,413 --> 01:10:09,832
Now,
Pop's hustling me
for a job.

1237
01:10:09,915 --> 01:10:11,667
I mean, it's like
my entire family, Shari.

1238
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,836
It's like they're from
their own little galaxy.

1239
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:15,004
Ed.

1240
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:16,839
Every family's crazy.

1241
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:19,675
Yeah, but...
No, I mean,

1242
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:22,887
if it was my family on TV...

1243
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:26,473
Oh, my God! I'd just
have to kill myself!

1244
01:10:41,989 --> 01:10:45,034
How about us?
We're doing all right,
aren't we?

1245
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:50,539
I saw that girl

1246
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,833
come on to you at
<i>The Tonight Show.</i>

1247
01:10:52,917 --> 01:10:54,877
What girl?
That model.

1248
01:10:58,297 --> 01:11:00,799
Oh, wait a minute.
Shari, that was nothing.

1249
01:11:01,592 --> 01:11:04,261
I mean, look it, I was
leaving, she needed
a ride to the airport,

1250
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:06,347
so I offered her a ride.

1251
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:10,351
Wait a minute. Hey. Hey.

1252
01:11:15,731 --> 01:11:17,524
I want you.

1253
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:19,568
Shari,

1254
01:11:20,361 --> 01:11:22,363
I don't want anybody else.

1255
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:26,575
Really?

1256
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:28,202
Yeah.

1257
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:31,372
It's you I want.

1258
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,455
Bro! Breasts!

1259
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:15,290
Huh? Where?

1260
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,917
- Come on!
- Ed, help!

1261
01:12:18,836 --> 01:12:21,005
Come on, guys. Don't.

1262
01:12:21,088 --> 01:12:22,297
<i>Come on!</i>

1263
01:12:25,426 --> 01:12:26,552
She left?

1264
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:30,472
Yeah. She asked for
a transfer to another city,
and she left.

1265
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:34,476
I mean,
someone put her breasts
on the Internet.

1266
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:37,021
Oh, Christ!
She couldn't
take it anymore.

1267
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:38,522
We have people living
in our hallway,

1268
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:41,567
going through
our trash, reporters.

1269
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:43,610
So, she...

1270
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:46,447
Not even good-bye?
Nothing?

1271
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:48,824
Boy, you know...

1272
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:50,492
<i>I mean, when it starts
to go wrong,</i>

1273
01:12:50,576 --> 01:12:53,162
<i>there's, like, nothing
you can do to stop it.</i>

1274
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:57,332
<i>You know, because, Rita,
I don't think I could've
tried any harder.</i>

1275
01:12:58,167 --> 01:12:59,376
<i>I don't.</i>

1276
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:01,795
<i>Do you?</i>

1277
01:13:08,802 --> 01:13:10,554
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1278
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,639
You see? You see?

1279
01:13:12,765 --> 01:13:14,058
You see that?

1280
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:18,103
<i>Hi, Ed.</i>

1281
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:21,982
<i>- Oh, honey, hi.
- What are you doing?</i>

1282
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:23,650
<i>I know this might
seem a little unusual.</i>

1283
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:25,027
<i>How'd you get
in my apartment?</i>

1284
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:27,696
<i>Well, I had to be
a little stealthy
about the whole thing.</i>

1285
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,239
What is she holding?

1286
01:13:30,074 --> 01:13:31,116
Ed's underwear.

1287
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,911
<i>Get out of my house.
I can explain everything...</i>

1288
01:13:34,495 --> 01:13:35,996
<i>Keep my underwear!</i>

1289
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:40,000
<i>I love you,
and I want to marry you, Ed.</i>

1290
01:13:41,502 --> 01:13:43,796
See? Now,
that's television. Huh?

1291
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:48,050
All right. Now what?
Where do we go from here?

1292
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:49,676
Didn't we order lunch
like an hour ago?

1293
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,386
Yes, Chinese.
Good. Good.

1294
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:54,765
So, now,
what do we have Ed do next?
Come on, springboards, ideas.

1295
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,350
Notions! Cynthia?

1296
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,644
We could
help him find Shari.
No, no, no.

1297
01:13:58,727 --> 01:14:01,313
Enough of her.
I hate her,
audiences hate her.

1298
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:03,065
Let's just bury her
and move on.

1299
01:14:03,148 --> 01:14:04,274
Tell him
I'll call him back.

1300
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:08,695
Excuse me. Do you know who
the audience is requesting
a lot of is that girl Jill

1301
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:11,073
that he met on
<i>The Tonight Show.</i>
She really scored.

1302
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:12,616
Well, let's get her.
Let's make this happen.

1303
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:14,118
What are we cocking
around here for?

1304
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:15,869
Cynthia, do something.
Get on the phone.

1305
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:18,497
Is lunch literally
coming from China?
I don't understand it.

1306
01:14:19,206 --> 01:14:20,958
Remember when you
were interviewing me

1307
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,127
and you asked me
if I had a dream?

1308
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,295
And I said, "Well,
sure I got a dream.

1309
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:27,381
"I just don't know
what it is yet."

1310
01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:31,218
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
great line. Try to work
that into the show.

1311
01:14:33,554 --> 01:14:35,722
What if
Shari's the dream?

1312
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:37,641
Now, come on, Ed.

1313
01:14:37,724 --> 01:14:40,561
You're beating
yourself up for nothing.
You knew her history.

1314
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:44,606
When the going gets tough,
Shari gets going.

1315
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:47,276
As far away as possible.
She's...

1316
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:50,904
She's one of those
I'll-dump-you-before-
you-dump-me chicks.

1317
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:54,491
Yeah, but what if we
could get UPS to tell us
where they sent her?

1318
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:56,493
You know? And then
I could go visit her,

1319
01:14:56,577 --> 01:14:58,954
and, hell, we could
even move the show
there for a while.

1320
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:02,583
Ed, if you want this thing
to work with her,

1321
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:06,628
the best thing
you can do right now is
to give her some space.

1322
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:10,090
<i>Maybe even, uh,
see other people.</i>

1323
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:11,842
Whoa, whoa!

1324
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:14,344
What do you mean?
Like, right away,
Cynthia? No.

1325
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:17,097
<i>No, no, I...</i>
Ed, you're a star.

1326
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:20,100
<i>But, you know,
celebrities like you,</i>

1327
01:15:20,726 --> 01:15:23,270
Tom Cruise or whoever,
you have a responsibility.

1328
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:28,192
<i>I don't think your fans are
gonna be too thrilled
sitting around watching you</i>

1329
01:15:28,275 --> 01:15:30,861
have a major case
of the mopeys.

1330
01:15:30,944 --> 01:15:32,905
They've got 200 channels
to choose from.

1331
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:36,783
<i>And it's not like
you're giving up Shari.</i>

1332
01:15:36,867 --> 01:15:38,869
My sister was going
with a guy.

1333
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:40,996
They hit a little rough spot,

1334
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:43,332
started seeing other people,
they got back together.

1335
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:47,628
Last month they had
their third child,
for what it's worth.

1336
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:53,383
Twenty-two! Thirty-two!

1337
01:15:53,884 --> 01:15:57,012
Hey, two,
stay with the quarterback.
One, you got the iso on Ed.

1338
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:03,393
He breaks to the inside.
I think he's
got a step on him!

1339
01:16:04,937 --> 01:16:06,230
Hey, Shecky,
you lost the feed.

1340
01:16:07,231 --> 01:16:09,816
Ed! Hey, Ed!
Get up!
You lost the feed!

1341
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:14,738
Hey, Jill.

1342
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,450
Oh, Eddie, what are you
doing to me? Look alive!

1343
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:21,370
You guys go ahead.
I'll be back, sometime.

1344
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:23,747
Ed, where you going?
Let's get the game going!

1345
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:26,083
- No, it's not.
- It's a set-up.

1346
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:27,125
It's a set-up.

1347
01:16:27,209 --> 01:16:28,543
I'm gonna
ask Cynthia.

1348
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:30,504
Come on,
it's such a set-up.

1349
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:33,257
Did you arrange this?

1350
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,925
Whose dog is that?

1351
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:37,010
<i>- Out for a walk.
- Walking your dog?</i>

1352
01:16:37,469 --> 01:16:39,388
- That's your dog.
<i>- What's your dog's name?</i>

1353
01:16:40,013 --> 01:16:42,266
<i>Um, Ginger.</i>

1354
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:45,352
Nielsen looks pretty
good on TV, huh?
Yeah.

1355
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:47,229
<i>Hey, man.
Way to go, Ed!</i>

1356
01:16:47,813 --> 01:16:49,314
<i>Picture's worth $1,000.</i>

1357
01:16:54,069 --> 01:16:55,696
<i>That's delicious.</i>

1358
01:17:03,412 --> 01:17:04,830
Smile, baby!

1359
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,167
Do you really
think she likes him?

1360
01:17:09,251 --> 01:17:10,836
She doesn't give
a crap about him.

1361
01:17:17,884 --> 01:17:19,845
You want us to kiss? Ed.

1362
01:17:24,016 --> 01:17:26,101
<i>He should be
a model or something.</i>

1363
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:27,561
<i>He's gorgeous.</i>

1364
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:40,407
Hey, listen.
Should we, um...

1365
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:50,709
Oh! Oh, jeez!

1366
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:51,918
It's, uh...

1367
01:17:53,003 --> 01:17:55,797
Listen, Jill, it's getting
kind of late. I mean...

1368
01:17:56,173 --> 01:17:57,215
Is he kidding?

1369
01:17:57,799 --> 01:17:59,509
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

1370
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,721
Tomorrow night.
I got a...

1371
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:06,433
I got a thing... No,
that's not tomorrow night.

1372
01:18:09,186 --> 01:18:10,354
Well, listen.

1373
01:18:10,437 --> 01:18:12,731
Why don't you come
around here and, um,

1374
01:18:13,982 --> 01:18:17,402
I can make you dinner,
and maybe you could
bring a video and...

1375
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:21,114
Well, you know,
we can make
a night of it. Hmm?

1376
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:24,659
Hmm.

1377
01:18:36,421 --> 01:18:38,590
<i>Stay behind the barricade.</i>

1378
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:41,802
Go, go, go.

1379
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:44,096
Holy shit!

1380
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:56,316
I'm starting to feel
a little pressure.

1381
01:18:57,067 --> 01:18:59,027
Think he's gonna do it?
Hell, yeah.

1382
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:02,948
The guy hasn't had
sex in six weeks.
What, like we have?

1383
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:05,325
Yeah.

1384
01:19:16,461 --> 01:19:19,214
We'll park
your car for you, Ed.
Save your strength.

1385
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:42,863
<i>Get out of the way.</i>

1386
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:01,047
Ed, Ed, Ed.

1387
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:04,718
Hi.
Hi.

1388
01:20:09,264 --> 01:20:11,349
Jill! Jill!

1389
01:20:12,559 --> 01:20:13,894
Come on in.

1390
01:20:14,686 --> 01:20:15,854
Oh, wow.

1391
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:18,732
Look at you!
Thanks.

1392
01:20:19,191 --> 01:20:20,901
Those boobs are so fake.

1393
01:20:21,193 --> 01:20:23,445
She's such a slut.
Total slut.

1394
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:34,498
<i>Big, big crowd tonight.</i>

1395
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:37,250
<i>I know. They've been
there for hours.</i>

1396
01:20:43,298 --> 01:20:44,674
<i>Ed?
Yeah.</i>

1397
01:20:44,758 --> 01:20:45,967
<i>Do you want to come
have a little nibble?</i>

1398
01:20:46,259 --> 01:20:47,260
What...

1399
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:51,181
Oh.

1400
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:53,391
Yeah. Sure.

1401
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:55,602
Hey!

1402
01:20:56,061 --> 01:20:57,270
Here, baby.

1403
01:20:58,939 --> 01:20:59,940
I thought you had a dog.

1404
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:02,150
Huh? Oh.

1405
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:04,444
No, that was a friend's.
I've just got lovely Isabella.

1406
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,071
Hey, baby.

1407
01:21:06,613 --> 01:21:08,698
Yes. Good girl.
Come on. Down you go.

1408
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:09,991
Good girl.

1409
01:21:29,177 --> 01:21:31,263
Wow!

1410
01:21:37,185 --> 01:21:38,186
Good?

1411
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:41,481
Mmm-hmm.

1412
01:21:54,703 --> 01:21:56,037
Uh, Mr. President?

1413
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:03,420
I love her!

1414
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:06,464
Get out of the way!
I love her! I love her!

1415
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:05,690
Wow!

1416
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:14,115
Hot damn! We are
go for sex, people.

1417
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:29,714
I love this show, bro.

1418
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,051
Is this okay, Cynthia?

1419
01:23:33,134 --> 01:23:35,428
Don't leave yet.
This is cable.
I want you to stay with him.

1420
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:50,777
Oh, my.

1421
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,962
What's he doing?

1422
01:24:11,965 --> 01:24:13,091
Ed, are you okay?

1423
01:24:14,384 --> 01:24:16,010
Something broke my fall.

1424
01:24:17,137 --> 01:24:18,471
Oh!

1425
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:20,640
Oh!

1426
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:26,521
Please, let me through.

1427
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:29,315
Is it bad? Please, is it bad?

1428
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:31,151
I think she
just broke her leg.

1429
01:24:33,903 --> 01:24:37,282
Excuse me. My back's
a little sore, all right?
I didn't break it.

1430
01:24:37,365 --> 01:24:40,034
I can walk.
We're just taking
you in for an X-ray.

1431
01:24:40,785 --> 01:24:42,996
<i>The thing got,
what, the highest
ratings of the year.</i>

1432
01:24:43,079 --> 01:24:44,497
<i>Higher than the Super Bowl.</i>

1433
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:45,582
<i>That's kind of
the same thing, isn't it?</i>

1434
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:48,668
<i>A big build-up, and then
one team just can't perform.</i>

1435
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,882
<i>And all that boy did was
hurt that little girl's pussy.</i>

1436
01:24:55,675 --> 01:24:58,094
<i>I'm talking about her cat.
I'm talking about the cat.</i>

1437
01:24:58,178 --> 01:24:59,763
<i>If Ed had been a star,</i>

1438
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:02,432
<i>if he had really,
kind of, given a terrific</i>

<i>performance that night,</i>

1440
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:06,811
<i>you know, the American people
would've loved him,
but he failed us.</i>

1441
01:25:06,895 --> 01:25:09,564
<i>He basically failed us.
He failed us as a man.</i>

1442
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:12,901
Look at this.

1443
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:16,529
<i>She did not. She did
not break my heart.</i>

1444
01:25:17,864 --> 01:25:20,950
All right, look,
I understand
that I'm fair game,

1445
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:22,243
but just tell it like it is.

1446
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:26,039
<i>She was a hot-looking chick.
I get that, man,
but I knew the score.</i>

1447
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:27,415
"Broke my heart."

1448
01:25:27,499 --> 01:25:29,459
You know what Jill did?

1449
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:30,960
Jill went out to LA

1450
01:25:31,044 --> 01:25:33,338
and got one of those scandal
agents that handle, like,

1451
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:37,884
Joey Buttafuoco,
Kato Kaelin and
Gennifer Flowers.

1452
01:25:48,937 --> 01:25:50,271
Oh, my God,
he wrote a book.

1453
01:25:57,779 --> 01:26:00,240
He never even
read a book, man.

1454
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:05,453
<i>What's your feeling
about the meaning,
if any, of</i> Ed TV?

1455
01:26:06,329 --> 01:26:09,666
<i>Well, Harry, I feel
that Ed is the apotheosis</i>

1456
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:12,126
<i>of a prevailing
American syndrome.</i>

1457
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:15,004
<i>It used to be that people
were famous for being special.</i>

1458
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:18,383
<i>Now they're
considered special,
merely for being famous.</i>

1459
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:21,344
<i>You see that fame
has become a moral good</i>

1460
01:26:21,427 --> 01:26:24,055
<i>in this country.
It's its own virtue.</i>

1461
01:26:30,562 --> 01:26:31,604
<i>All right.</i>

1462
01:26:31,688 --> 01:26:33,356
<i>We thought since
we have Ray Pekurny</i>

1463
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:35,275
<i>on the panel today,

1464
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:37,610
<i>It is called</i> My
Brother Pissed On Me.

1465
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:43,867
<i>Is that a metaphorical title,
or did your brother
actually piss on you?</i>

1466
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:47,620
<i>I put everything in
the book. Everything.</i>

1467
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:50,164
<i>All this is in the book.</i>

1468
01:26:50,248 --> 01:26:53,626
<i>I'll be honest,
I have not read the book,
because it looks stupid.</i>

1469
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:55,044
Um...

1470
01:26:58,798 --> 01:26:59,883
What?

1471
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:01,217
I'm just saying that

1472
01:27:01,301 --> 01:27:04,387
maybe we should start thinking
about when we want to
take him off the air.

1473
01:27:04,554 --> 01:27:06,764
Why? What are you talking
about "take him off the air"?

1474
01:27:06,848 --> 01:27:08,224
He just got out
of the hospital.

1475
01:27:08,308 --> 01:27:09,642
He's fine. The cat's fine.

1476
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:11,060
The ratings are
higher than ever.

1477
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:14,564
Well, you know. It's like
when you're chewing gum
and blowing a bubble.

1478
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:16,357
Oh, good, a metaphor.
Right.

1479
01:27:16,441 --> 01:27:18,276
And the bubble
keeps getting bigger

1480
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:20,153
and bigger and
you've got to decide.

1481
01:27:20,445 --> 01:27:22,572
When do you suck it in?
Or, if you don't,

1482
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,824
it explodes and then
you've got gum face.

1483
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:27,869
Cynthia.

1484
01:27:28,536 --> 01:27:32,373
I started out as
an associate producer
on <i>Good Morning, Fresno.</i>

1485
01:27:33,041 --> 01:27:35,084
And I didn't get
from there to here

1486
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,503
by worrying about
getting gum in my face.

1487
01:27:40,173 --> 01:27:42,133
All I'm saying is
I think we've peaked.

1488
01:27:42,634 --> 01:27:45,970
And all I'm saying is,
you don't know your
ass from a toboggan.

1489
01:27:47,096 --> 01:27:49,098
We're gonna stay with the boy
for another month.

1490
01:27:49,182 --> 01:27:50,975
And you know how
I know I'm right?

1491
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:53,394
Because I'm driving
the big car,

1492
01:27:53,478 --> 01:27:55,188
and you're driving
the little car.

<i>Ed, you put anybody

1494

they're gonna wind up
rolling off a table

1495
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,662
and squashing a cat.

1496
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:12,497
No, man,

1497

All right, look.

1506
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:32,934
Eddie, it's Dad.

1507
01:28:33,601 --> 01:28:35,937
He's dead.
He had a heart attack.

1508
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:43,861
Did I tell you he was
gonna die? Did I say?
Huh? Huh? Come on.

1509
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:52,286
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm looking for my mother.
My name's Ed Pekurny.

1510
01:28:52,412 --> 01:28:55,540
- Mr. Pekurny? I'm Dr. Geller.
- Yeah?

1511
01:28:55,623 --> 01:28:56,833
Hi.

1512
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:58,584
Your mother's just
lying down for a minute.

1513
01:28:58,668 --> 01:29:00,211
We gave her something
to calm her down.

1514
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:02,171
Okay. Good.
Thank you. Can I see her?

1515
01:29:02,255 --> 01:29:05,341
Why don't you just
give her a minute?
She'll be right out.

1516
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:07,719
Why don't you sit
over here for a second?

1517
01:29:08,511 --> 01:29:10,805
What happened to him?
Did he...

1518
01:29:11,848 --> 01:29:14,726
Did he suffer any,
or was it quick?

1519
01:29:15,101 --> 01:29:16,602
It was very quick.

1520
01:29:17,228 --> 01:29:19,605
Between you and me,
it's not a bad way to go.

1521
01:29:20,231 --> 01:29:21,607
<i>How's that?</i>

1522
01:29:21,691 --> 01:29:23,026
<i>Making love to your wife.</i>

1523
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:25,153
<i>It's very sweet.</i>

1524
01:29:26,529 --> 01:29:28,865
They were making love
when he had a heart attack?

1525
01:29:28,948 --> 01:29:30,700
According to your mother.

1526
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:33,453
Eddie, thank God you're here.

1527
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:35,788
How's your mother?
Al!

1528
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:38,374
What's going on?
Thought he was dead.

1529
01:29:38,458 --> 01:29:39,500
<i>How'd you get here?</i>

1530
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:42,170
The neighbors drove me over.
The worst goddamn driver.

1531
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:44,172
What are you doing here?

1532
01:29:44,255 --> 01:29:45,298
Where's Jeanette?

1533
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:47,008
I thought you
said he was dead?

1534
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:48,509
Who?
Al!

1535
01:29:48,926 --> 01:29:52,597
No, no. No, the deceased
is Henry Pekurny.

1536
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:56,517
Good twist.

1537
01:29:56,768 --> 01:29:58,895
This is beautiful.
I love this!
What?

1538
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:00,146
Don't you get it?
No.

1539
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:01,939
The mother was
shtupping the ex-husband.

1540
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:05,985
You thought it was me?

1541
01:30:06,944 --> 01:30:08,237
Well, yeah. Al.

1542
01:30:08,654 --> 01:30:10,490
It was your father, Hank.

1543
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:13,076
Your mother went
to see him, and he

1544
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:15,244
suddenly dropped
dead of a heart attack.

1545
01:30:16,412 --> 01:30:18,873
Dr. Geller, Dr. Stack
wants to see you.

1546
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,334
Oh. Excuse me.

1547
01:30:25,838 --> 01:30:28,674
Could I have your autograph?
It's for my niece.

1548
01:30:32,178 --> 01:30:34,555
Al. How did you...

1549
01:30:35,181 --> 01:30:36,599
The Burkharts drove me over.

1550
01:30:38,684 --> 01:30:41,104
Are you all right?
I'm fine. I...

1551
01:30:42,188 --> 01:30:44,273
Good. I gotta pee.

1552
01:30:45,525 --> 01:30:46,859
Wish me luck.

1553
01:30:48,402 --> 01:30:50,822
<i>Hey.</i>

1554
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:54,742
<i>Mom.</i>

1555
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:05,294
All right. What happened, Mom?

1556
01:31:05,378 --> 01:31:06,796
Oh, Eddie, it was horrible.

1557
01:31:06,879 --> 01:31:08,798
He called me up.
Who?

1558
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:10,299
Hank.

1559
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:11,634
He said he
wanted to talk to me.

1560
01:31:11,717 --> 01:31:13,970
He wanted to apologize
for everything.

1561
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:18,099
And I went over to this
horrible place where
he was staying, and I...

1562
01:31:18,182 --> 01:31:20,226
I just felt
so sorry for him.

1563
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:22,478
<i>So you had sex with him?</i>

1564
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:24,981
<i>What?</i>

1565
01:31:25,064 --> 01:31:28,192
<i>The doctor told me
you were having sex.
He told me.</i>

1566
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:31,154
<i>To you in front of them?
Yeah, Mom.</i>

1567
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:34,365
<i>He assumed Hank
was your husband.
You know, common sense.</i>

1568
01:31:35,116 --> 01:31:38,077
<i>My God! On TV!
Mom, why? How?</i>

1569
01:31:39,412 --> 01:31:41,164
<i>One thing
led to another.</i>

1570
01:31:41,247 --> 01:31:43,916
<i>He was my husband once.
But, Al is your husband now.</i>

1571
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:46,878
You think it's been easy
for me all these years?

1572
01:31:46,961 --> 01:31:48,588
Al can't have sex!

1573
01:31:49,297 --> 01:31:52,049
Apparently,
neither can Hank, Mom.

1574
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:54,677
<i>Let's recap this
whole thing, all right?</i>

1575
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,596
<i>The mother's too
good at it, right?</i>

1576
01:31:56,679 --> 01:31:58,639
<i>Both brothers stink at it.</i>

1577
01:31:58,723 --> 01:32:00,808
<i>The stepfather
can't do it at all.</i>

1578
01:32:00,892 --> 01:32:02,643
<i>And the father did it,
but it killed him.</i>

1579
01:32:02,727 --> 01:32:05,062
<i>How the hell did
this family reproduce?</i>

1580
01:32:05,146 --> 01:32:08,274
<i>How did they even get here?</i>

1581
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:11,944
<i>This is worse than
all the daily tabloid
television that exists.</i>

1582
01:32:12,778 --> 01:32:15,072
<i>Isn't the appeal
of this show now,</i>

1583
01:32:15,156 --> 01:32:17,366
<i>that everybody's
got a skeleton
in their closet?</i>

1584
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:19,660
<i>Yeah, but how
many skeletons can
one family have?</i>

1585
01:32:19,744 --> 01:32:22,038
<i>No, I think our
country is saying,
"We've had enough of this."</i>

1586
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:24,874
<i>Let's get back to
the way TV used to be.</i>

1587
01:33:00,284 --> 01:33:01,869
How you doing, boy?

1588
01:33:05,665 --> 01:33:07,166
How was the service?

1589
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:08,709
It was all right.

1590
01:33:08,793 --> 01:33:12,046
His parole officer
said some lovely
words and...

1591
01:33:12,129 --> 01:33:14,674
Once again I was
reminded the end is near.

1592
01:33:16,259 --> 01:33:18,177
Sorry you couldn't
come in, kiddo,

1593
01:33:19,345 --> 01:33:20,930
but, for some reason,
the family feels

1594
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:23,683
they're not coming off
so well on TV.

1595
01:33:29,063 --> 01:33:31,148
You and Mom
are gonna work things
out, aren't you?

1596
01:33:31,232 --> 01:33:32,692
I'm moving out.

1597
01:33:34,652 --> 01:33:36,445
No, Al, what do you mean
you're moving out?

1598
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:37,822
I'm gonna be
living with my brother.

1599
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:39,532
He's not in such
good shape as me,

1600
01:33:39,615 --> 01:33:42,034
but I'm looking
forward to the pillow fights.

1601
01:33:45,496 --> 01:33:46,497
Hank.

1602
01:33:46,998 --> 01:33:49,250
You know, Hank was
always good with the ladies.

1603
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:50,876
Always good-looking.

1604
01:33:51,669 --> 01:33:55,006
Hell, he's been dead
for two days, he still
looks better than me.

1605
01:33:56,424 --> 01:33:58,426
I want to tell
you something, Al.

1606
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:02,805
You know, Hank, he...

1607
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:12,023
You're my father, Al.

1608
01:34:38,758 --> 01:34:40,634
<i>Take care of
yourself, huh?</i>

1609
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,887
<i>You know I will.</i>

1610
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:56,108
I guess, that's when
you know the head, it's...

1611
01:34:57,068 --> 01:34:58,402
Different.

1612
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:05,701
<i>You have
done it! I've had it!</i>

1613
01:35:05,785 --> 01:35:08,162
<i>Hey, hey, Crockett.
Ease up, man.</i>

1614
01:35:08,245 --> 01:35:12,083
<i>Ease up? He just devoured
my entire Buddy
Holly collection!</i>

1615
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:13,209
<i>What is it with you?</i>

1616
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:14,377
<i>How would you
like it if somebody</i>

1617
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,921
<i>chewed up your
personal belongings?</i>

1618
01:35:17,713 --> 01:35:19,924
<i>See this blanket?
You see this?</i>

1619
01:35:20,007 --> 01:35:22,593
<i>Elvis loves this blanket.
It's his most favorite
thing in the whole...</i>

1620
01:35:28,516 --> 01:35:31,060
<i>- Three more months?
- Yeah, absolutely.</i>

1621
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:35,314
Ed TV's <i>more popular than
ever. The resurgence in
interest is astounding.</i>

1622
01:35:35,398 --> 01:35:38,192
And, of course,
this means another big
bonus payment for you.

1623
01:35:41,821 --> 01:35:44,990
Ed, have you
thought about moving
in with your mother?

1624
01:35:45,908 --> 01:35:49,453
I mean, she's all alone now.
I'm sure she could
use your support.

1625
01:35:55,876 --> 01:36:00,172
You know, we're not as dumb
as you people think we are.

1626
01:36:09,181 --> 01:36:12,268
I'm taking what little
dignity there is left,

1627
01:36:13,853 --> 01:36:15,229
and I quit.

1628
01:36:20,192 --> 01:36:21,944
Can somebody
validate my parking here?

1629
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:24,238
Ed, I'm afraid
that's not possible.

1630
01:36:24,321 --> 01:36:26,449
Okay, Mr. Big Network.
I'll pay for it myself.

1631
01:36:26,532 --> 01:36:28,659
No, I mean, you can't quit.

1632
01:36:30,703 --> 01:36:32,705
The hell I can't.
Look it, I just did.

1633
01:36:33,456 --> 01:36:36,459
I know, Ed, but you see,

1634
01:36:36,542 --> 01:36:39,795
you agreed to stay on the air
as long as we asked you to.

1635
01:36:39,879 --> 01:36:42,965
The station entered into this
with that understanding.

1636
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:46,302
Now, if you had
refused up front,

1637
01:36:46,385 --> 01:36:49,054
well, we would have
done this with somebody else.

1638
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:52,558
You can't just
change the rules

1639
01:36:52,641 --> 01:36:54,101
in the middle
of the game, son.

1640
01:36:54,185 --> 01:36:55,561
It's just not fair.

1641
01:36:56,395 --> 01:36:59,607
Listen, if you don't let
me out of this now, I...

1642
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:02,776
I'm gonna go home,
and stick my thumb
up my butt, all right?

1643
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:04,904
Sit on my ass and
not do a damn thing.

1644
01:37:04,987 --> 01:37:06,739
I won't go anywhere.

1645
01:37:07,573 --> 01:37:09,200
What kind of show
does that sound like?

1646
01:37:09,283 --> 01:37:10,493
Uh, not too good.

1647
01:37:10,576 --> 01:37:12,536
No, not too good.
No, you see, that's why

1648
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:15,623
it states very specifically
in your contract

1649
01:37:15,706 --> 01:37:19,335
that if you don't continue
to live a normal life...

1650
01:37:19,418 --> 01:37:23,214
Well, then you're
in breach. See?

1651
01:37:23,756 --> 01:37:28,302
And you're liable
for all the station's
financial losses.

1652
01:38:01,835 --> 01:38:03,295
I'll get this.

1653
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:18,894
Autograph, please?

1654
01:38:55,514 --> 01:38:56,849
Ed, come on out!

1655
01:39:06,108 --> 01:39:07,109
Shari.

1656
01:39:07,735 --> 01:39:08,736
Oh, my God.

1657
01:39:09,445 --> 01:39:10,738
Move! Excuse me!

1658
01:39:10,904 --> 01:39:12,615
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Shari!

1659
01:39:13,407 --> 01:39:14,408
Shari!

1660
01:39:15,826 --> 01:39:17,036
Watch it! Watch it!

1661
01:39:18,245 --> 01:39:20,706
Who's got the shot? Come on.
Who's got the shot?

1662
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,000
Just give it to me.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1663
01:39:23,751 --> 01:39:25,669
Come on, he's on the move!
Go! Go! Go!

1664
01:39:34,762 --> 01:39:35,804
We got him! We got him!

1665
01:39:35,888 --> 01:39:37,514
Fire it up. We're rolling.

1666
01:39:46,815 --> 01:39:48,734
Keep the microwave
high, Shecky.

1667
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:56,200
Come on.

1668
01:39:56,533 --> 01:39:58,410
Get up! Get up!

1669
01:39:58,911 --> 01:40:00,412
Come on, come on,
he's getting away.

1670
01:40:18,806 --> 01:40:20,432
Hi. Hi, one, please.

1671
01:40:27,106 --> 01:40:28,440
Excuse me.

1672
01:40:28,607 --> 01:40:29,775
Hey!

1673
01:40:30,275 --> 01:40:31,402
Give me one.

1674
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:35,114
I'm looking for
a girl, tall...
Bad wig?

1675
01:40:35,239 --> 01:40:37,324
Yeah.
Theater 3. Your
ticket, your ticket.

1676
01:40:43,747 --> 01:40:45,791
Oh!
Watch it! Watch it!

1677
01:40:51,213 --> 01:40:53,340
Shari, are you okay?
I'm sorry.

1678
01:40:56,176 --> 01:40:57,177
Shari!

1679
01:41:07,771 --> 01:41:08,772
Shari?

1680
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:12,735
<i>- Shari?
- It's not me.</i>

1681
01:41:12,818 --> 01:41:14,069
<i>Well, it sounds like you.</i>

1682
01:41:14,153 --> 01:41:15,612
Well, it's not.
Now, go away.

1683
01:41:15,696 --> 01:41:16,947
I thought you moved.

1684
01:41:17,489 --> 01:41:19,825
I just came for my
brother's birthday.

1685
01:41:20,284 --> 01:41:21,452
<i>What, in a disguise?</i>

1686
01:41:21,702 --> 01:41:24,121
<i>I wanted to see
you, but I didn't
want you to see me.</i>

1687
01:41:25,289 --> 01:41:28,584
Oh, Shari, listen to me.
I know why you left.

1688
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:30,961
Everyone knows why,
Ed. I told you why.

1689
01:41:31,044 --> 01:41:33,046
No, no, you said it
was because of the TV.

1690
01:41:33,714 --> 01:41:34,923
But I don't believe that.

1691
01:41:35,215 --> 01:41:36,759
I mean, look at us.

1692
01:41:36,842 --> 01:41:40,679
You know, we've been
with people before,
and it didn't work out.

1693
01:41:41,305 --> 01:41:43,515
And none of it
was on TV, Shari.

1694
01:41:45,142 --> 01:41:46,351
None of it.

1695
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:51,273
You and me...

1696
01:41:51,356 --> 01:41:52,858
We've been burned.

1697
01:41:53,609 --> 01:41:55,235
You know, and we're scared.

1698
01:41:58,363 --> 01:41:59,823
And that's why you left.

1699
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:03,660
And that's why,

1700
01:42:06,538 --> 01:42:08,957
I didn't do a damn
thing to stop you.

1701
01:42:16,215 --> 01:42:17,382
Shari?

1702
01:42:26,308 --> 01:42:27,643
All right.

1703
01:43:02,094 --> 01:43:03,679
Oh!

1704
01:43:03,762 --> 01:43:04,972
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1705
01:43:28,579 --> 01:43:29,580
Well...

1706
01:43:32,666 --> 01:43:34,501
All right,
listen, you stay here.

1707
01:43:35,627 --> 01:43:37,880
I'm leaving. These
guys are coming with me.

1708
01:43:37,963 --> 01:43:39,214
I don't know what
the hell I'm going to do,

1709
01:43:39,298 --> 01:43:40,883
but I'll figure something out
so we can be together.

1710
01:43:40,966 --> 01:43:42,384
Okay?
Okay.

1711
01:43:54,313 --> 01:43:56,023
Let's go, guys.

1712
01:43:56,106 --> 01:43:58,191
No, Mike. Follow Shari.

1713
01:44:00,611 --> 01:44:02,112
<i>Mike, Shecky, come on.</i>

1714
01:44:02,362 --> 01:44:03,363
We can't.

1715
01:44:04,364 --> 01:44:07,701
Mike, Shecky, I'm leaving.
You're supposed
to follow me. Let's go.

1716
01:44:19,212 --> 01:44:21,089
Give him room.

1717
01:44:24,134 --> 01:44:27,095
Hi, Ed.
Why the hell are they
still following Shari?

1718
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:30,182
Well, it's their new
concept since the...

1719
01:44:30,265 --> 01:44:31,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1720
01:44:32,643 --> 01:44:35,020
What's going on here?
Why is my family on TV?

1721
01:44:36,104 --> 01:44:38,190
Like I was saying,
it's a new concept.

1722
01:44:38,273 --> 01:44:41,151
See, since Shari
and your family all
signed releases,

1723
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:42,444
we're allowed to
follow them on camera

1724
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:43,737
even though
you're not with them.

1725
01:44:44,613 --> 01:44:47,491
So, you see, we go with
whoever's the most exciting.

1726
01:44:47,574 --> 01:44:48,867
See, and right now, look.

1727
01:44:48,951 --> 01:44:51,203
You see, it's you, see, and...

1728
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:52,537
Oh, uh...

1729
01:44:52,621 --> 01:44:53,622
Me.

1730
01:44:53,705 --> 01:44:54,998
You can't do this.

1731
01:44:55,123 --> 01:44:56,416
I'm not a lawyer.

1732
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,835
I'm just a guy who
eats three meals
a day in this truck.

1733
01:44:59,461 --> 01:45:01,964
You got to get
them off the air.
This is not part of the deal.

1734
01:45:02,047 --> 01:45:04,967
I don't give a goddamn.
Make the call, man.

1735
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:07,511
Make the call. Get 'em off.

1736
01:45:07,594 --> 01:45:09,638
Look, Ed, you
know, this is...

1737
01:45:09,721 --> 01:45:11,264
I'll get 'em off.
Hey! Hey!

1738
01:45:11,348 --> 01:45:12,975
Ed! Ed!

1739
01:45:14,476 --> 01:45:16,937
Ed, come on!
Ed, if you break the truck...

1740
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:19,398
If you break the truck,
they'll charge you for it.

1741
01:45:19,898 --> 01:45:21,400
<i>They'll have a new
one here in 15 minutes.</i>

1742
01:45:21,733 --> 01:45:24,403
Ten.

1743
01:45:24,569 --> 01:45:26,488
Come on, Ed.
This is crazy.

1744
01:45:27,656 --> 01:45:28,657
Hey, hey.

1745
01:45:29,783 --> 01:45:31,660
They got you, man.

1746
01:45:31,743 --> 01:45:33,453
Just go home.

1747
01:45:34,913 --> 01:45:36,456
Go home, Gomer!

1748
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:40,335
<i>Ed, this is crazy. Come on.</i>

1749
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:53,765
You know what?

1750
01:45:58,645 --> 01:46:00,147
They're right.

1751
01:46:02,607 --> 01:46:03,900
This is a great idea.

1752
01:46:04,651 --> 01:46:06,945
My family is interesting.

1753
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:09,072
I mean, hell, look at 'em.

1754
01:46:10,949 --> 01:46:13,243
But everybody's
interesting, right?

1755
01:46:14,494 --> 01:46:18,331
I bet you that
wacky little group

1756
01:46:18,415 --> 01:46:21,209
that owns this network,
that I had the meeting with.

1757
01:46:21,293 --> 01:46:24,629
I bet they're pretty
goddamn interesting, too,
don't you think?

1758
01:46:25,589 --> 01:46:26,715
<i>Huh?</i>

1759
01:46:27,215 --> 01:46:28,759
<i>I'll bet they are.</i>

1760
01:46:28,842 --> 01:46:33,221
<i>Oh, yeah, I bet they are.
I'll bet you $10,000 they are.</i>

1761
01:46:36,224 --> 01:46:37,225
Yeah.

1762
01:46:38,435 --> 01:46:40,729
I ought to loosen up
a little bit, shouldn't I?

1763
01:46:40,812 --> 01:46:43,899
Let's have a little
fun with this thing.

1764
01:46:43,982 --> 01:46:48,153
All right, let's really blow
it out. Let's have a contest.

1765
01:46:48,987 --> 01:46:51,573
Who can dig up

1766
01:46:51,656 --> 01:46:54,701
the most embarrassing
and humiliating information
on any of the executives

1767
01:46:54,785 --> 01:46:56,036
of the NorthWest
Broadcast Company,

1768
01:46:56,119 --> 01:46:58,747
which owns this
station, True TV.

1769
01:46:59,372 --> 01:47:01,750
<i>'Cause after all,
why should anyone</i>

1770
01:47:01,833 --> 01:47:03,502
<i>have any privacy, right?</i>

1771
01:47:04,002 --> 01:47:05,212
So I want anything.

1772
01:47:05,295 --> 01:47:07,672
Anything from
their past, their present,

1773
01:47:07,756 --> 01:47:09,174
business, personal,
you name it.

1774
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:11,259
Man, if it's dirty and
it's true, we want it.

1775
01:47:11,343 --> 01:47:13,095
<i>Whoever brings the sleaziest</i>

1776
01:47:13,178 --> 01:47:15,972
and most degrading
material to me,

1777
01:47:16,056 --> 01:47:18,225
I'm gonna pay you

1778
01:47:18,308 --> 01:47:20,519
$10,000.

1779
01:47:20,977 --> 01:47:21,937
Yeah!

1780
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:23,480
I love this guy!

1781
01:47:24,189 --> 01:47:28,110
<i>And tonight at 9:00,
I'll announce
the big winner, all right?</i>

1782
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:30,987
Now, you're gonna
need my home number,
all right?

1783
01:47:31,363 --> 01:47:34,199
Call me any time, all right?

1784
01:47:34,282 --> 01:47:36,618
And if you get in right
now, I'm gonna throw
in a little bonus.

1785
01:47:36,701 --> 01:47:39,246
You're gonna get a free book
by author Ray Pekurny,

1786
01:47:39,329 --> 01:47:41,706
entitled <i>My
Brother Pissed On Me.</i>

1787
01:47:42,457 --> 01:47:44,960
All right, America.
Come on, baby.
Let's start digging.

1788
01:47:45,335 --> 01:47:48,380
This is ridiculous.
How can this be legal?

1789
01:47:48,547 --> 01:47:50,132
It's illusion.
It's slander.

1790
01:47:50,215 --> 01:47:51,341
Not technically.

1791
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:54,928
Because he is not
showing a reckless
disregard for the truth.

1792
01:47:55,011 --> 01:47:56,847
Oh, come on!
What are you saying?

1793
01:47:56,930 --> 01:47:59,432
At 9:00 he can say
whatever he wants
about us?

1794
01:47:59,516 --> 01:48:00,934
That is ridiculous.
There has got to be

1795
01:48:01,017 --> 01:48:02,686
some way we can
shut this hillbilly up.

1796
01:48:02,769 --> 01:48:04,980
Hey, I've got an idea.
What?

1797
01:48:05,897 --> 01:48:07,649
Let's not shut him up.

1798
01:48:07,732 --> 01:48:10,819
Let's get him to push
it to Sunday when
the audience is bigger,

1799
01:48:10,902 --> 01:48:12,696
promote it for
the next five days,

1800
01:48:12,779 --> 01:48:15,115
I mean, really hype it
because it's
a ratings grabber.

1801
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:17,242
Which is all that counts,
really, so run with it.

1802
01:48:17,951 --> 01:48:20,162
You were right, I was wrong.

1803
01:48:20,245 --> 01:48:22,581
See, <i>Ed TV</i> is going
to be bigger than ever.

1804
01:48:22,956 --> 01:48:25,834
Cynthia, another word
and you may
consider yourself fired.

1805
01:48:26,042 --> 01:48:27,669
Uh-oh.

1806
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:31,423
Can you give me a hint?
What word? Um... Asshole?

1807
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,595
Shithead? Would that...
Is that one word
or two, though?

1808
01:48:37,762 --> 01:48:39,014
I never can remember that.

1809
01:48:39,431 --> 01:48:41,224
Shithead. Anyway, listen.

1810
01:48:41,308 --> 01:48:45,854
It has been a real
pleasure working for you.
I have loved it.

1811
01:48:46,229 --> 01:48:48,356
Loved it, loved it,
loved it.

1812
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:50,358
Loved it.

1813
01:48:50,525 --> 01:48:53,945
So, you're saying,
he didn't tip you?
Well, maybe you're not hot.

1814
01:48:54,863 --> 01:48:56,948
Yeah. Uh...

1815
01:48:57,282 --> 01:48:59,367
Look, I gotta go.
My brother's here.

1816
01:49:10,503 --> 01:49:13,048
Look, we
gotta settle this.

1817
01:49:19,471 --> 01:49:20,847
All right, man.

1818
01:49:23,058 --> 01:49:24,309
They're gonna fight.

1819
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:27,646
Maybe they'll kill each other.
That's at least an ending.

1820
01:49:38,949 --> 01:49:40,909
Okay, settled.
Yeah, great.

1821
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:45,622
That's it?
What was that?

1822
01:49:45,705 --> 01:49:46,957
Some brotherly...

1823
01:49:47,916 --> 01:49:49,668
Southern brotherly thing.

1824
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,963
Here you go.
You weren't gonna swing.
Were you ready to swing?

1825
01:49:53,046 --> 01:49:54,839
I was ready
to throw it there.

1826
01:49:55,298 --> 01:49:57,717
Hey, you know,
good thing I was here.

1827
01:49:57,801 --> 01:49:59,886
You got all kinds of calls.

1828
01:50:04,349 --> 01:50:06,893
This is not good.
This is not a good thing.

1829
01:50:08,353 --> 01:50:09,729
Would 40 of these kill me?

1830
01:50:13,233 --> 01:50:14,776
What if we compromised?

1831
01:50:14,859 --> 01:50:17,696
Asked him to stay
on two more weeks
and then kick him off.

1832
01:50:20,907 --> 01:50:22,617
Ah, phone.
<i>All right, here we go.</i>

1833
01:50:24,703 --> 01:50:25,745
Hello.

1834
01:50:25,829 --> 01:50:27,872
Is this Ed?
<i>Yes, it is. Who's this?</i>

1835
01:50:28,206 --> 01:50:29,958
I've got some
information for you.

1836
01:50:30,041 --> 01:50:31,293
It's better than
anything you've got.

1837
01:50:31,543 --> 01:50:32,877
Okay, I'm here.

1838
01:50:34,129 --> 01:50:37,841
I got this from one
of the secretaries
that works at the network.

1839
01:50:37,924 --> 01:50:39,801
Got a little blitzed
at the Christmas party.

1840
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:43,888
Listen carefully.
I'm only gonna say this once,

1841
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:47,517
'cause talking this way
is really hurting my throat.

1842
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:50,603
Can anyone see
what he's writing?

1843
01:50:52,397 --> 01:50:53,732
"Duck"?

1844
01:50:53,815 --> 01:50:56,276
Did anybody do
anything with a duck?

1845
01:50:56,568 --> 01:51:00,030
Jesus, I'd hate to be stuck
in a foxhole with this group.

1846
01:51:00,113 --> 01:51:02,282
There's not a full-grown
pair of testicles among you.

1847
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:03,450
Uh, sir, I...

1848
01:51:03,533 --> 01:51:05,243
Hey, look, whatever
little embarrassments

1849
01:51:05,327 --> 01:51:07,037
he comes up with,
we'll spin it.

1850
01:51:07,912 --> 01:51:11,166
This guy is gonna
stay on TV until he dies.

1851
01:51:12,334 --> 01:51:13,501
Relax!

1852
01:51:17,714 --> 01:51:20,425
<i>Okay. Yes.
I got it. Thank you.</i>

1853
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:24,596
Well?
I think we've got a winner.

1854
01:51:25,972 --> 01:51:27,265
<i>Rayford?</i>

1855
01:51:27,349 --> 01:51:29,100
<i>All right, 9:00 yet?</i>

1856
01:51:29,184 --> 01:51:30,685
<i>Er, 9:01.</i>

1857
01:51:30,769 --> 01:51:32,896
<i>9:01, 9:01,
got it.</i>

1858
01:51:32,979 --> 01:51:34,356
<i>Okay.</i>

1859
01:51:34,439 --> 01:51:37,192
<i>I don't know how
many of you out there
are paying attention right now</i>

1860
01:51:37,275 --> 01:51:42,197
<i>but for those of you who
are, I think we just
got the winner. Whoo!</i>

1861
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:48,787
<i>Okay, how many of you know</i>

1862
01:51:50,038 --> 01:51:52,624
what a penile implant is?

1863
01:52:00,298 --> 01:52:02,258
<i>Well, as it's explained
to me, what happens is,</i>

1864
01:52:02,342 --> 01:52:05,178
<i>you get two cylinders,
one, two and
they are inserted</i>

1865
01:52:06,429 --> 01:52:07,889
<i>into the shaft.</i>

1866
01:52:10,183 --> 01:52:13,728
<i>Now, to get an erection,
what this man does is,</i>

1867
01:52:13,812 --> 01:52:17,023
<i>he squeezes this pump,
and it forces a fluid</i>

1868
01:52:17,107 --> 01:52:19,359
<i>that goes in the
cylinders into the shaft.</i>

1869
01:52:22,612 --> 01:52:25,031
<i>And</i> voilà,
<i>you've got your stiffie.</i>

1870
01:52:26,408 --> 01:52:28,618
<i>You're good to go.
So, who's this lucky guy?</i>

1871
01:52:29,661 --> 01:52:32,247
<i>I mean, who is this
True TV executive</i>

1872
01:52:32,330 --> 01:52:35,166
<i>who can now get his
Johnson to head north
anytime he wants?</i>

1873
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:37,335
<i>Well, I'm gonna tell you
who the lucky man is now.</i>

1874
01:52:37,419 --> 01:52:38,420
Tell us, brother!

1875
01:52:38,503 --> 01:52:40,296
<i>All right then.</i>

1876
01:52:40,463 --> 01:52:42,215
<i>Here we go.</i>

1877
01:52:42,298 --> 01:52:44,217
<i>The man of the hour is Mr...</i>

1878
01:52:47,429 --> 01:52:48,763
Whoo!

1879
01:52:49,264 --> 01:52:51,808
<i>True TV regrets
to inform our audience that</i>

1880
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:54,394
<i>due to circumstances
beyond our control</i>

1881
01:52:54,519 --> 01:52:57,313
Ed TV <i>will no
longer be presented.</i>

1882
01:53:01,401 --> 01:53:03,319
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1883
01:53:03,862 --> 01:53:05,363
Who's the guy
with the phony...

1884
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:07,407
What do they expect
us to do now?

1885
01:53:12,328 --> 01:53:13,329
Look...

1886
01:53:13,788 --> 01:53:15,665
I don't know who he
was talking about.

1887
01:53:15,748 --> 01:53:18,042
I don't even know
whether or not it was true.

1888
01:53:19,043 --> 01:53:22,422
But he was about
to name one of you,
and I'll be damned

1889
01:53:22,505 --> 01:53:26,301
if I'll have one of my people
humiliated on public...

1890
01:53:26,384 --> 01:53:28,219
I mean, not that
there's anything to be

1891
01:53:28,303 --> 01:53:30,305
embarrassed about,
I mean, if it's true.

1892
01:53:30,388 --> 01:53:32,599
The point is,
it's a normal medical...

1893
01:53:32,682 --> 01:53:35,685
What the hell
are you looking at,
you redheaded putz?

1894
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:42,150
Pack it up and
go on home now.
Leave me in peace.

1895
01:53:44,736 --> 01:53:45,904
Don't come back
now, you hear?

1896
01:53:46,154 --> 01:53:47,155
Well...

1897
01:53:48,865 --> 01:53:50,658
Back to infomercials.

1898
01:53:52,327 --> 01:53:53,995
Hey, I'm on TV! Look at me!

1899
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:55,497
- Yeah, right here!
- Hi, Mom!

1900
01:54:03,922 --> 01:54:07,425
<i>So Ed is no longer on TV.
Sam, how did he make out?</i>

1901
01:54:08,092 --> 01:54:10,011
<i>Ed made out
like a bandit.</i>

1902
01:54:10,094 --> 01:54:12,972
<i>A spokesperson
for True TV announced that
Ed received a check</i>

1903
01:54:13,056 --> 01:54:15,308
<i>covering his four
months on the air,</i>

1904
01:54:15,391 --> 01:54:18,394
<i>his balloon payment,
and an additional bonus</i>

1905
01:54:18,478 --> 01:54:22,273
<i>to show the network's
appreciation for
all his quote,</i>

1906
01:54:22,857 --> 01:54:25,360
<i>"Hard work
and loyalty." Unquote.</i>

1907
01:54:26,569 --> 01:54:29,948
<i>When asked exactly
what happened, a True TV
spokesperson said</i>

1908
01:54:30,031 --> 01:54:32,325
<i>they had no official comment,</i>

1909
01:54:32,408 --> 01:54:35,036
<i>but that things
had been worked out.</i>

1910
01:54:54,514 --> 01:54:56,641
<i>Okay,
let's do a final...</i>

1911
01:54:57,517 --> 01:55:00,019
<i>Perhaps say
good-bye here to</i> Ed TV.

1912
01:55:00,103 --> 01:55:01,563
<i>Have we seen the last
of Ed, do you think?</i>

1913
01:55:01,646 --> 01:55:02,647
<i>I would think so.</i>

1914
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:05,066
<i>In five years,
no one will
remember who he is.</i>

1915
01:55:05,149 --> 01:55:07,610
<i>Five years? Six months.
He's a</i> Macarena.

1916
01:55:07,694 --> 01:55:09,153
<i>It's Ed-free TV now.</i>
