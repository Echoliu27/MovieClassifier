1
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:30,971
Aah!

2
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:35,172
Wee-be-be-bee.

3
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:36,971
Will you take a look at that?

4
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,571
Pretty pathetic, huh?

5
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:40,091
Well, you'll never
believe this,

6
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,412
but that llama
you're looking at

7
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:43,212
was once a human being

8
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:44,892
And not just
any human being

9
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,332
That guy was an emperor

10
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,453
A rich, powerful ball
of charisma

11
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:49,533
Oh, yeah!

12
00:00:50,853 --> 00:00:52,132
This is his story

13
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:55,092
Well, actually my story

14
00:00:55,212 --> 00:00:58,013
That's right--
I'm that llama

15
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,333
The name is Kuzco

16
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:02,734
Emperor Kuzco

17
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,694
I was the world's
nicest guy,

18
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,373
and they ruined my life
for no reason

19
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:08,133
Oh, is that hard to believe?

20
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:09,974
Look, I tell you what
You go back away--

21
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:12,134
you know, before
I was a llama,

22
00:01:12,214 --> 00:01:13,574
and this will all make sense

23
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:16,534
All right, now see,
that's a little too far back

24
00:01:16,614 --> 00:01:18,455
Oh, ho! Look at me!

25
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:19,934
That's me as a baby

26
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:21,854
Waah!

27
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:25,455
Ahem! All right,
let' smove ahead

28
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,896
Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:46,977
Theme song guy: There are
despots and dictators

30
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:49,176
Political manipulators

31
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:53,737
There are blue bloods
with the intellects of fleas

32
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:55,897
There are kings
and catty tyrants

33
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:58,857
Who are so lacking
in refinements

34
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:00,977
They'd be better suited
swinging from the trees

35
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:04,737
He was born and raised
to rule

36
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,097
No one has ever been
as cool

37
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:10,258
In a thousand years
of aristocracy

38
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:14,138
An enigma and a mystery

39
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,338
In Mesoamerican history

40
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,658
The quintessence of
perfection that is he

41
00:02:21,378 --> 00:02:22,698
Ok, this is the real me

42
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:23,699
Not this

43
00:02:23,859 --> 00:02:25,019
- This
- Not this.

44
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,579
- Winner!
- Loser.

45
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,779
Ok, see this palace?

46
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,339
Everyone in it
is at my command

47
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,379
Check this out

48
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,699
Butler.

49
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,819
Chef.

50
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,219
Theme song guy.

51
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,700
Oh, yeah!

52
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,100
He's the sovereign lord
of the nation

53
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,580
He's the hippest cat
in creation

54
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,380
He's the alpha,
the omega, A to Z

55
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,740
And this perfect world
will spin

56
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,980
Around his every
little whim

57
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,981
'Cause this perfect world
begins and ends with

58
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:55,981
Me.

59
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:57,101
What's his name?

60
00:02:57,221 --> 00:03:00,981
Kuzco

61
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:02,221
That's his name

62
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,941
Kuzco

63
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,341
He's the king
of the world

64
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:08,422
Kuzco

65
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:10,182
Is he hip or what?

66
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:12,102
Kuzco

67
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:13,781
Yeah

68
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:17,422
Gow!

69
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:19,222
You threw off my groove!

70
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:21,263
I'm sorry,
but you've thrown off

71
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,623
the emperor's groove.

72
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:25,583
Sorry!

73
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,422
You were saying?

74
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:34,063
What's his name?
Kuzco

75
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:37,224
Kuzco

76
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:39,864
That's his name

77
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:44,184
Is he hip or what?

78
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:48,624
Don't you know he's
the king of the world?

79
00:03:48,784 --> 00:03:53,145
Whoa, yeah

80
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:54,425
Oww!

81
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:57,584
Ha!

82
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:58,585
Boom, baby!

83
00:03:58,825 --> 00:04:00,305
Aah! Your Highness,

84
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:02,065
it is time for you
to choose your bride.

85
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:03,545
Allrighty

86
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,106
Trot out
the ladies

87
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:07,186
Let's take a look-see.

88
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,705
Hate your hair.
Not likely.

89
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,865
Yikes, yikes, yikes,

90
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:13,426
and let me guess.

91
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:15,586
You have
a great personality.

92
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:17,546
Is this really
the best you could do?

93
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:19,907
Oh, yes. Oh, no.
I mean, perhaps--

94
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,707
What
is he babbling about?

95
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:24,146
He's like the thing
that wouldn't shut up

96
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:28,027
Anyway, still wondering about
that llama in the opening?

97
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:32,267
Well, let me show you the people
responsible for ruining my life

98
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,428
First, there's Pacha

99
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:37,427
Uh, excuse me.

100
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:39,107
I'm here to see
Emperor Kuzco.

101
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:40,787
You see,
I got this summons--

102
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,628
Inside, up the stairs,
and to the left

103
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:44,428
Just follow the signs

104
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:47,428
Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.

105
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:51,508
Uh, and don't be fooled
by the folksy peasant look

106
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:53,068
Oh!

107
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:55,108
Pardon me
That's mine

108
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,149
Oh, here you go.

109
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,629
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

110
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,429
Aah! Oh, hey.
Are you all right?

111
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,429
Here. Let me, uh--

112
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,349
Oh, you're
so very kind.

113
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:03,349
What happened?

114
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,350
Well, I...

115
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,429
I threw off
the emperor's groove.

116
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,629
- What?
- His groove!

117
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:09,149
The rhythm in which
he lives his life,

118
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:10,469
his pattern of behavior.

119
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:11,590
I threw it off,

120
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,110
and the emperor had me
thrown out the window.

121
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,310
Oh, really?

122
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,510
I'm supposed
to see him today.

123
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,871
Don't throw off
his groove!

124
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:19,950
Oh, ok.

125
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,710
Beware the groove.

126
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,150
Hey, are you
gonna be all right?

127
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,790
Groove.

128
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,551
Kuzco: You see
what I mean?

129
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:29,471
This guy's trouble,
but as bad as he is,

130
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,671
he is nothing compared
to what's coming up next

131
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,112
And why have you
come here today?

132
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:34,871
Well

133
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:37,951
Your Highness--
I mean, Your Grace.

134
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:40,432
Ok, gang
Check out this piece of work

135
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:43,512
This is Yzma,
the emperor's advisor--

136
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:46,592
living proof that dinosaurs
once roamed the Earth

137
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:49,072
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man

138
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:51,072
Every decade or so
she gets a new one

139
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:52,872
This year's model
is called Kronk

140
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,073
Yeah, I got
that there, Yzma.

141
00:05:58,913 --> 00:05:59,793
Unh!

142
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:01,753
Yep, that's Kronk

143
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,873
Now lately, Yzma's
gotten into this bad habit

144
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:07,273
of trying to run the country
behind my back,

145
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:09,354
and IÂ’m thinkin'
that's got to stop

146
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:11,514
It is no concern
of mine

147
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:12,594
whether your family
has...

148
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:13,754
What was it again?

149
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,394
Um, food.

150
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:17,634
Ha! You really should
have thought of that

151
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:19,514
before you
became peasants.

152
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:20,714
We're through here.

153
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:22,754
Take him away. Next!

154
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,475
But l--

155
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:26,075
Oh, ok.

156
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:29,595
Ugh.

157
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:31,675
The nerve of some
of those peasants, huh?

158
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:34,035
Tell me about it.
Aah!

159
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:35,115
Hi there.

160
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:36,595
Ooh, Your Highness.

161
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:37,595
Ahem.

162
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:40,076
Oh, oh, oh,
ha ha ha. Um...

163
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:41,636
Uh, you were
doing it again.

164
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:44,555
Doing? Doing...
Doing what?

165
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:45,796
Doing my job.

166
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:46,796
I'm the emperor,

167
00:06:46,876 --> 00:06:48,356
and you're the emperor's
advisor.

168
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:49,356
Remember that?

169
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:50,636
But, Your Highness,

170
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:53,357
I was only dealing with
meaningless peasant matters.

171
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:54,357
Whoa

172
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:57,197
Look at these wrinkles

173
00:06:57,357 --> 00:07:00,277
What is holding
this woman together?

174
00:07:00,397 --> 00:07:01,957
What the--

175
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:03,797
How long
has that been there?

176
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:05,357
Good thinkin', Yzma

177
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:06,357
What do you say,
Kuzco?

178
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:07,838
Whoa! No touchy!

179
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,078
No touchy.
No touch.

180
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:11,158
Excuse me,
Your Highness

181
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:12,677
The village leader
is here to see you.

182
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:14,317
Oh, great.
Send him in.

183
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:15,878
Oh, and by the way,
you're fired.

184
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,118
Fired?

185
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,638
W-W-What do you mean,
fired?

186
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:20,878
Um, how else
can I say it?

187
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:22,359
You're being let go,

188
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,919
your department's
being downsized,

189
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:25,439
you're part of
an outplacement,

190
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,718
we're going in a
different direction,

191
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:27,758
we're not picking
up your option...

192
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:29,399
Take your pick.
I got more.

193
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,639
But l-- You--uh--

194
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:32,999
Uhh.

195
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,399
But--
But, Your Highness,

196
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,080
I have been nothing
if not loyal to the empire

197
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,199
for--for--for
many, many years.

198
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,799
Hey, hey, everybody
hits their stride.

199
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,720
You just hit yours
50 years ago.

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,760
So...who's
in my chair?

201
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,760
Oh, oh! I know!

202
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,761
Yzma.

203
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:53,241
Yzma's in your
chair, right?

204
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,040
Very good, Kronk.

205
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,200
Here. Get the snack.

206
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,880
Got it!

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,241
Unh! Oof!.

208
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,241
Ok, you heard
the man.

209
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,241
Up, up, up.

210
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:03,481
IÂ’m ok
I'm fine

211
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,362
Ah.

212
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,761
ok. Show him in.

213
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:12,881
Ahem.

214
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,602
Uh, afternoon,
Your Highness.

215
00:08:14,722 --> 00:08:16,442
I'm here because
I received a summons--

216
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,442
Hey,
there he is!

217
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,362
My main village man.

218
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:20,843
Um, Pacha.

219
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:22,762
Anyway, I got
this summons--

220
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:24,282
Pacha.

221
00:08:24,402 --> 00:08:25,722
That's right.

222
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:27,522
You are just the man
I wanted to see.

223
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:28,843
I am?

224
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:31,203
Word on the street is
you can fix my problem.

225
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:35,604
You can fix my problem,
can't you?

226
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,883
Sure.
I'll do what I can.

227
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:40,483
Good, good. That's just
what I wanted to hear.

228
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,284
Are you aware of
just how important

229
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:43,724
your village is
to the empire?

230
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,564
Well, I know
we grow the crops

231
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:46,964
that you use here
at the palace.

232
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:48,884
We also herd the llamas
that you--

233
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:53,604
My village?

234
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:54,684
Oh, yeah.

235
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:56,845
You got a pretty sweet
little setup there

236
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:59,445
on top of that hill,
don't you? Ha ha ha!

237
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:01,925
Yeah. My family has
lived on that hilltop

238
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:04,246
for the last
6 generations.

239
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,565
Uh-huh.

240
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:07,085
So tell me,

241
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:09,405
where do you find
you get the most sun?

242
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:10,645
Oh, I'd say

243
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:13,846
just on the other side
of those trees.

244
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:16,126
When the sun hits
that ridge just right,

245
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:18,406
these hills sing.

246
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:19,726
Well, that settles it.

247
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:20,766
Really?

248
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:22,046
Yep. Problem solved.

249
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,246
Thanks for coming.

250
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:24,286
That's it?

251
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:25,806
That's all
you wanted me for?

252
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,887
I just needed
an insider's opinion

253
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,447
before I ok'd this spot
for my pool.

254
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,927
Uh...your pool?

255
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:33,927
Boo-yah!

256
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,607
Welcome to
Kuzcotopia,

257
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:37,287
my ultimate
summer getaway

258
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:39,167
complete
with water slide.

259
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,768
What?

260
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:41,808
Isn't it great?

261
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:43,968
It's my birthday gift
to me. Ha!

262
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:45,768
I'm so happy.

263
00:09:45,848 --> 00:09:47,848
Uh...uh...

264
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:50,808
um...l don't understand
how this could happen.

265
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:52,568
Well, let me
clear it up for you.

266
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:54,688
At my birthday
celebration tomorrow,

267
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:55,689
I give the word,

268
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,369
and your town
will be destroyed

269
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:59,729
to make way for this...

270
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:06,529
So, if I were you,

271
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:07,849
I'd pick up some
change-of-address forms

272
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:08,889
on the way home.

273
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,130
But, um,
where will we live?

274
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,010
Hmm...

275
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,170
Don't know,
don't care.

276
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,170
How's that?

277
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,929
Oh, but wait.
You can't--

278
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,450
When I give the word,

279
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,531
your little town thingy
will be bye-bye.

280
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:27,811
Bye-bye!

281
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:29,411
Oh, w--wait. No--

282
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:31,170
Heh heh. Boohoo.

283
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,491
Oh, yeah
Everything was goin' my way

284
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,491
Or so I thought

285
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:39,532
He can't get rid of me
that easily.

286
00:10:39,612 --> 00:10:43,692
Who does that ungrateful
little worm think he is?

287
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:44,691
Does he...

288
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,292
A little to the left.

289
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:50,092
...have any idea of
who he's dealing with?

290
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,372
How could he
do this to me?

291
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:54,213
Why, I practically
raised him.

292
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:56,173
Yeah, you think he
would've turned out better.

293
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:58,132
Yeah, go figure.

294
00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:00,212
Well, it's better you're
takin' out your anger

295
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,213
on these things instead
of the real Kuzco, huh?

296
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:04,653
That's it, Kronk!

297
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:05,653
- That's it!

298
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,614
I'll get rid of Kuzco.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

299
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:10,494
The real Kuzco?

300
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,973
Of course
the real Kuzco.

301
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,853
Don't you see?
It's perfect.

302
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,374
With him out of the way
and no heir to the throne,

303
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:20,694
I'll take over
and rule the empire.

304
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:22,054
Brilliant!

305
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:23,615
So how does that work

306
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,295
with you bein' fired
and all?

307
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,894
The only ones who know
about that are the three of us,

308
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:29,734
soon to be the two of us.

309
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:31,815
And I'm one of
those two, right?

310
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:32,935
To the secret lab!

311
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:37,736
Pull the lever, Kronk.

312
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:38,856
Wrong lever!

313
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:40,855
Huh?

314
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:43,655
Why do we even
have that lever?

315
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:46,936
Get out of my way!

316
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:50,576
Please remain seated

317
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,137
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times

318
00:11:52,257 --> 00:11:53,257
Whee!

319
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,536
Faster, faster!

320
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:58,176
Yzma, put your hands
in the air!

321
00:11:58,296 --> 00:12:00,617
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

322
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:07,218
Ah, how shall I do it?

323
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:09,137
Oh, I know.

324
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:10,977
I'll turn him
into a flea,

325
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,897
a harmless little flea,

326
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:14,778
and then I'll
put that flea in a box,

327
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,858
and then I'll put that box
inside of another box,

328
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:18,698
and then I'll
mail that box to myself,

329
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:19,818
and when it arrives,

330
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:20,978
Ah ha ha ha!

331
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:23,818
I'll smash it
with a hammer!

332
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:26,298
It's brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant, I tell you!

333
00:12:26,418 --> 00:12:27,298
Genius, I say!

334
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,099
Or, to save on postage,

335
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,380
I'll just poison him
with this.

336
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,819
Take it, Kronk.

337
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:40,339
Oh ho ho ho.
Feel the power.

338
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:41,339
Oh...

339
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,499
I can feel it.

340
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:44,700
Our moment of
triumph approaches.

341
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,420
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

342
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,500
It's dinner time.

343
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,861
So...is everything
ready for tonight?

344
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:02,141
Oh, yeah. I thought
we'd start off

345
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:03,421
with soup
and a light salad

346
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:04,981
and then see how
we feel after that.

347
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:07,301
Not the dinner...

348
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:08,461
The you know.

349
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,861
Oh, right.
The poison--

350
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:12,302
The poison for Kuzco,

351
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:14,702
the poison chosen
specially to kill Kuzco,

352
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:15,862
Kuzco's poison.

353
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:17,982
That poison?

354
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:18,981
Yes! That poison.

355
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:20,142
Got you covered.

356
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:21,462
Excellent.

357
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:23,582
A few drops in his drink,

358
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,022
then I'll propose a toast,

359
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:26,783
and he will be dead
before dessert.

360
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:28,263
Which is a real shame,

361
00:13:28,343 --> 00:13:29,423
because it's gonna
be delicious.

362
00:13:30,503 --> 00:13:31,543
Boom, bam, baby!

363
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:33,023
Let's
get to the grub

364
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:36,023
I am one hungry
king of the world.

365
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:40,383
So...no hard feelings
about being let go?

366
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,664
None whatsoever.

367
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:47,303
Kronk, get
the emperor a drink.

368
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:50,544
Drink. Right.

369
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,425
Your Highness.

370
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,025
Is something burning?

371
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:11,706
My spinach puffs!

372
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:18,506
Ahem.

373
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:21,426
So... he seems...

374
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:22,506
nice.

375
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:24,426
Heh. He is.

376
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:29,027
He's what,
in his late twenties?

377
00:14:29,107 --> 00:14:31,946
Heh heh. I'm not sure.

378
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,267
Saved 'em!

379
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:34,267
- That's great.
- Yzma: Great!

380
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:35,427
- Good job.
- Very good job.

381
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:37,427
Watch it.
They're still hot.

382
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:39,147
Ahem.

383
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:40,388
Ahem!

384
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:41,388
Heh heh heh.

385
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,108
Kronk.
The emperor

386
00:14:43,228 --> 00:14:45,387
needs his...
drink.

387
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:48,788
Right. Oh. Right.

388
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:58,388
Hey, Kronky,
everything ok back there?

389
00:14:58,508 --> 00:14:59,948
Well, heh.

390
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,789
Oh, uh...

391
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,389
Ooh. The drinks
were a bit on the...

392
00:15:04,469 --> 00:15:05,589
hmm...

393
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,549
oh...ugh...warm side.

394
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:09,830
Heh heh.

395
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,949
Hey, did you see
that sky today?

396
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:12,949
Talk about blue.

397
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,429
Ha ha ha.
Yes, Kronk.

398
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:16,230
Riveting.

399
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,070
A toast to
the emperor!

400
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,310
Long live Kuzco!

401
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,791
Don't drink the wine.

402
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:24,951
Poison.

403
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:33,551
Ah! Tasty.

404
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,831
Finally!
Ha ha ha!

405
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:38,112
Good work,
Kronk.

406
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:39,352
Oh, they're
so easy to make.

407
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,351
I'll get you
the recipe.

408
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:42,591
Now to get rid
of the body.

409
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:45,672
Ok! What were we saying?

410
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:49,112
Uh...we were
just making a toast

411
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:50,312
Yzma:
to your long and

412
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:53,953
healthy rule

413
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:56,992
Right. So what
are you gonna do?

414
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:59,432
I mean, you've been
around here a long time,

415
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:02,433
and I really mean
a long time. Um...

416
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:03,633
Ahem.

417
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,913
It might
be difficult

418
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:06,833
for someone of your age

419
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:08,633
adjusting to life
in the private sector.

420
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:10,673
Hey, Kronk, can you
top me off, pal?

421
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,273
Be a friend? Heh heh.

422
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,954
Now, about you
finding new work

423
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,634
Hit him on the head.

424
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:17,874
that's--that's
gonna be tough

425
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:19,074
More broccoli?

426
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:21,034
Because you're
you know

427
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:22,914
Let's face it
You're no spring chicken,

428
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:25,154
and I mean that
in the best possible way.

429
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:29,395
What? A llama?

430
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,515
He's supposed
to be dead!

431
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:33,315
Yeah, weird.

432
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:36,715
Let me see that vial.

433
00:16:39,155 --> 00:16:41,035
This isn't poison.

434
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:45,356
This is extract
of llama. Ugh!

435
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:46,516
You know,
in my defense,

436
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:47,916
your poisons
all look alike.

437
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:48,916
You might
think about

438
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:50,196
re labeling
some of them.

439
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:54,796
Take him out of town
and finish the job now!

440
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:55,796
What about dinner?

441
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:58,997
Kronk, this is
kind of important.

442
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:00,837
How about dessert?

443
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:04,597
Well, I suppose
there's time for dessert.

444
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,197
And coffee?

445
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:08,317
All right.
A quick cup of coffee.

446
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:11,397
Then take him out of town
and finish the job!

447
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:18,238
Cha cha
cha cha

448
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:19,557
Guess where I am
right now

449
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:21,718
Uh-huh. In the bag

450
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:23,638
Still think I'm
not the victim here?

451
00:17:23,718 --> 00:17:25,478
Watch. It gets better.

452
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:27,759
Hey! Ba-da ba-da
ba-da-da

453
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,359
Ugh, he's doing
his own theme music?

454
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,559
Ba-da
ba-da ba-da ba

455
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:39,799
Ba-da-ba

456
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,600
Gig, dumb,
and tone deaf

457
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,320
I am so glad I was
unconscious for all of this

458
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,320
Huhh!

459
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,760
Mission accomplished.

460
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,200
You're not
just gonna let him

461
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,201
die like that,
are you?

462
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:06,521
My shoulder angel.

463
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,561
Don't
listen to that guy

464
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:09,721
He's trying
to lead you

465
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:11,522
down the path
of righteousness.

466
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:14,482
I'm gonna lead you
down the path that rocks.

467
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:15,601
Oh, come off it.

468
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,761
You come off it!

469
00:18:16,881 --> 00:18:17,761
- You.
- You.

470
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:19,122
- You.
- You infinity.

471
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:20,122
Uhh!

472
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:22,522
Listen up, big guy.

473
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,002
I got 3 good reasons why
you should just walk away.

474
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:26,003
" Number one..."

475
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,043
Look at that guy!

476
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:29,163
He's got that sissy
stringy music thing.

477
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:30,362
We've been
through this.

478
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,402
It's a harp,
and you know it.

479
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:34,283
Oh, right.
That's a harp...

480
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:35,323
and that's a dress.

481
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:36,603
Robe!

482
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:38,523
Reason number 2.

483
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:39,843
Look what
I can do.

484
00:18:39,923 --> 00:18:41,004
Ha ha ha!

485
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:43,124
But... what does that
have to do with anything?

486
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:45,203
No, no.
He's got a point.

487
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:46,723
Listen, you guys.

488
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:49,604
You're sort of confusing me,
so be gone!

489
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:51,204
Uh, or, uh, you know.

490
00:18:51,284 --> 00:18:52,804
However I get rid
of you guys.

491
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,724
That'll work.

492
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,606
Um, what's with
the chimp and the bug?

493
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:19,646
Can we get back tome?

494
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,926
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.

495
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,167
What to do, what to do?

496
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:26,166
What do we do
with the body?

497
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:34,447
What am I gonna
tell the village?

498
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,127
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. ok.

499
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:39,408
What do I
do? What do I do?

500
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,487
- Aah!

501
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:46,888
Back!
Elbow! Shoulder!

502
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:48,448
- Unh!

503
00:19:54,968 --> 00:19:56,928
Oh. Hey! Hey, you!

504
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:58,048
Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.

505
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:00,649
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

506
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:03,169
Comin' through.
Hey, you with the cart!

507
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,209
Uh-oh

508
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,449
This is not good.

509
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:09,649
Uhh. Hope that doesn't
come back to haunt me.

510
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:03,853
Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!

511
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,372
Measure me again!

512
00:21:05,492 --> 00:21:07,053
Ha!
All right, Tipo.

513
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,333
Stand still
and let's see.

514
00:21:08,413 --> 00:21:09,933
Mom, you and I
both know

515
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,253
that it's
impossible for him

516
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:12,493
to have grown in
the last 5 minutes.

517
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:14,094
Mmm! Mmm!

518
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:15,494
Isn't it?

519
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,574
Look how much
you've grown!

520
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:19,493
What? Tipo, get
out of the way.

521
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,374
It's my turn again.
Measure me.

522
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:23,214
Dad's home!

523
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:27,014
Hey, ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

524
00:21:27,094 --> 00:21:28,895
Come here
Ha ha ha!

525
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,214
Dad! I ate
a bug today!

526
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,854
Oh! Was Mom
baking again?

527
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,415
Heh. Don't tell her
I said that.

528
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:37,655
I heard that.

529
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:39,695
Ok, everybody,
move aside

530
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:42,295
Lady with a baby
comin' through.

531
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,616
Dad, Dad, Dad!

532
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,216
Look at
how big I am!

533
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:46,416
We were all
measured today.

534
00:21:46,536 --> 00:21:47,415
Oh.

535
00:21:47,535 --> 00:21:49,015
I'm going through
a growth spurt.

536
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:50,456
I'm as big
as you were

537
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:51,456
when you were me.

538
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,056
Mm-hmm. Sure are.

539
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:55,936
That's not as impressive
as my loose tooth. See?

540
00:21:57,737 --> 00:21:59,137
Ok, ok, you two.

541
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:00,737
Our deal was that
you could stay awake

542
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:01,936
until Daddy came home.

543
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,976
Now say good night.

544
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:06,257
Dad,
do we have to?

545
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:11,537
No, you two can stay up.

546
00:22:11,657 --> 00:22:14,098
We're just gonna be sittin'
here tellin' each other

547
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:15,577
how much we love each other.

548
00:22:15,657 --> 00:22:16,657
Right, honey?

549
00:22:17,897 --> 00:22:18,817
- Ew!
- Blecch!

550
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:19,818
Good night.

551
00:22:20,978 --> 00:22:23,338
So what did
the emperor want?

552
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,338
Ahem.

553
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,419
You know what?
He couldn't see me.

554
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:27,499
Couldn't see you?

555
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,979
- Why not?
- I don't know.

556
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,378
Well, that's
just rude.

557
00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:31,778
Well, he is
the emperor.

558
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:32,778
I'm sure he's busy.

559
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:34,019
No, no, no, no. No.

560
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:36,419
Emperor or no emperor,
it's called common courtesy.

561
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:37,499
Honey...

562
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:39,099
If that were me,
I'd march right back there

563
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,899
and demand to see him,
and you know I would.

564
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,420
Sweetie, sweetie,
think of the baby.

565
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,019
Pacha, I'm fine.

566
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,619
This baby's not coming
for a while,

567
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,019
but even if it was,

568
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:48,940
I'd give that guy
a piece of my mind.

569
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,820
That kind of behavior
just--just--

570
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,860
Uhh!

571
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,460
I gotta go
wash something.

572
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,142
Pacha?

573
00:23:11,222 --> 00:23:12,261
You ok?

574
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:13,701
Hmm?

575
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:16,061
Oh, yeah. I'm just
a little tired from the trip.

576
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:19,902
Um...IÂ’m gonna go
put Misty away.

577
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:34,183
Uh, heh heh. Hi.
Excuse me.

578
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:35,183
2 seconds here.

579
00:23:35,263 --> 00:23:37,223
Um, I'm the one
in the cart. Remember?

580
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:39,903
This story's about me,
not him.

581
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:42,223
ok. You got it?
All right.

582
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:43,743
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.

583
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:47,384
Heh heh heh.

584
00:23:55,064 --> 00:23:56,224
Huh?

585
00:23:58,944 --> 00:23:59,864
Whoa.

586
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:02,905
Uhh. Oh.

587
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,265
Where'd you come from,
little guy?

588
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:06,745
No touchy.

589
00:24:06,865 --> 00:24:08,104
Aah! Demon llama!

590
00:24:08,224 --> 00:24:09,705
Demon llama? Where?

591
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,225
- Aah!
- Aah!

592
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,946
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Ooh hoo hoo!

593
00:24:16,066 --> 00:24:18,826
Ow! Ow, my head.

594
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:19,826
Ok, demon llama.

595
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:21,786
Just take it easy.

596
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:24,706
I mean you no harm.

597
00:24:24,786 --> 00:24:26,386
What are you
talking about--

598
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,786
Oh, wait. I know you.

599
00:24:28,906 --> 00:24:30,146
You're that whiny
peasant.

600
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:33,107
Emperor Kuzco?

601
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:35,147
Yeah. Who do you think
you were talkin' to?

602
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,426
Uh...how did--

603
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:39,147
Um...

604
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:40,587
you don't...

605
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:42,667
look like
the emperor.

606
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:44,467
What do you mean I don't
look like the emperor?

607
00:24:44,587 --> 00:24:45,948
Uh...oh...

608
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,468
do this...

609
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,348
What is this,
some kind of little game

610
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:50,667
you country folk like to--

611
00:24:50,787 --> 00:24:52,628
Aah! It can't be! Aah!

612
00:24:54,148 --> 00:24:55,308
Aah! Aah!

613
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:58,548
My face! Aah! My beautiful,
beautiful face!

614
00:24:58,668 --> 00:24:59,548
Ok, ok, ok.

615
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:01,109
I'm an ugly,
stinky llama!

616
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:02,549
Wait, ok,
Your Majesty.

617
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,829
- Llama face!
- Shh!

618
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:06,068
What happened?

619
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:08,589
I'm tryin' to
figure that out, ok?

620
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:12,109
Ohh-ho!

621
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:13,469
I can't remember.

622
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,110
I can't remember
anything.

623
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,510
Wait a minute.

624
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,310
I remember you.

625
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,629
I remember
telling you

626
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:20,869
that I was
building my pool

627
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:21,950
where
your house was,

628
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,670
and then you
got mad at me.

629
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,390
Ohh!

630
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,510
And you turned me
into a llama!

631
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,871
What? No, I did not.

632
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:31,271
Yes, and then
you kidnapped me.

633
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:32,750
Why would I
kidnap a llama?

634
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,110
I have no idea.

635
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,071
You're the criminal
mastermind, not me.

636
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:37,271
What?

637
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:39,271
Hmm. You're right.

638
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:41,391
That's giving you
way too much credit.

639
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:43,752
ok. I have to get back
to the palace.

640
00:25:43,872 --> 00:25:46,672
Yzma's got
that "secret lab."

641
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,551
I'll just
snap my fingers

642
00:25:48,671 --> 00:25:49,831
and order her
to change me back.

643
00:25:49,951 --> 00:25:52,032
Hey, you.
No time to waste.

644
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:53,192
Let's go.

645
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,593
Hey, tiny, I want
to get out of this body.

646
00:25:58,713 --> 00:26:00,113
Wouldn't you?
Now let's go.

647
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:05,513
Build your summerhouse
somewhere else.

648
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,953
You want to run that
by me again?

649
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:11,473
I can't let you go back

650
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:13,114
unless you change
your mind

651
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:16,833
and build your summer
home somewhere else.

652
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:19,073
Hmm. I got
a little secret for you.

653
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:21,754
Come here.
No, closer.

654
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:24,114
I don't make deals
with peasants!

655
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:27,555
Then I guess I can't
take you back.

656
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:29,274
Fine.
I don't need you.

657
00:26:29,394 --> 00:26:30,874
I can find
my own way back.

658
00:26:30,994 --> 00:26:32,154
I wouldn't recommend it.

659
00:26:32,274 --> 00:26:34,595
It's a little dangerous
if you don't know the way.

660
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:35,715
Nice try, pal.

661
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:37,155
No, really.
I'm telling you,

662
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:38,995
There are
jaguars and snakes

663
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:39,995
and quicksand

664
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:40,995
I'm not listening.

665
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:41,996
I'm not kidding.

666
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:43,955
Listen, you cannot
go in there.

667
00:26:44,075 --> 00:26:44,955
La la la la

668
00:26:45,075 --> 00:26:48,355
Oh. Heh heh.
Still not listening.

669
00:26:48,435 --> 00:26:49,876
Aw, you...

670
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:51,756
Fine. Fine.

671
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,556
Go ahead!

672
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:55,276
If there's no Kuzco,

673
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:57,157
there's no Kuzcotopia.

674
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:59,716
Takes care
of my problem.

675
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:07,037
Hmm.

676
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:15,877
Scary jungle.
Right.

677
00:27:15,997 --> 00:27:19,038
Ooh, a leaf.
Ooh, it might attack me.

678
00:27:19,158 --> 00:27:20,758
Oh, it's a scary tree.

679
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:23,638
I'm afraid. Ha ha.

680
00:27:23,718 --> 00:27:26,198
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor,

681
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,278
and as such,

682
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:31,398
I'm born with an innate
sense of direction.

683
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:32,959
Ok, where am I?

684
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,879
Wha--

685
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:39,878
Help me!
Help me!

686
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,559
Help me!

687
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,319
Uhh.

688
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:45,999
Too late.

689
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,760
Ok, that was the freakiest
thing I've ever seen.

690
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,040
Aah!

691
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,200
Hmm.
What do you want?

692
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,800
Oh, for me?

693
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,241
Why, I don't know
what to say.

694
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:06,241
Ow!

695
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:07,361
Hit the road, bucky.

696
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,961
Aah! Ow!

697
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,401
Huh?

698
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:15,401
Huh?

699
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:18,482
Huh?

700
00:28:19,602 --> 00:28:20,602
Uh-oh.

701
00:28:29,162 --> 00:28:30,722
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

702
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:32,803
No, no.
No, don't.

703
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:39,923
Ha!

704
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:43,523
Aah!

705
00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:46,324
No!

706
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,364
Aah!

707
00:28:56,884 --> 00:28:59,004
Aah!

708
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:08,645
You killer jaguars...

709
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:10,365
Whoa!

710
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:18,006
Aah-eee!

711
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:20,125
Aah!

712
00:29:26,526 --> 00:29:27,446
Aah!

713
00:29:29,927 --> 00:29:31,127
Yee-aah!

714
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,446
Aah!

715
00:29:33,526 --> 00:29:35,406
Don't worry,
Your Highness. I gotcha.

716
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:36,526
You're safe now.

717
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:43,207
Maybe I'm just new to
this whole rescuing thing,

718
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:44,688
but this, to me,

719
00:29:44,808 --> 00:29:46,608
might be considered
kind of a step backwards,

720
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:47,607
wouldn't you say?

721
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:49,127
No, no, no.
It's--It's ok.

722
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:50,287
This--This is
all right.

723
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:51,928
We can figure this out.

724
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:55,568
I hate you.

725
00:29:55,688 --> 00:29:59,329
- No!
- Yaah!

726
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:02,168
Aah! Ow!

727
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:11,169
Whoo hoo hoo!

728
00:30:11,249 --> 00:30:12,849
Aah!

729
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:14,250
Ow!

730
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,569
Ow!

731
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:16,649
Uhh!

732
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,170
I don't know about you,

733
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,730
but I'm getting
all funned out.

734
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,010
Uh-oh.

735
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,690
Don't tell me.

736
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:29,370
We're about to go over
a huge waterfall.

737
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,170
- Yep.
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?

738
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,410
Most likely.

739
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,010
Bring it on.

740
00:30:35,091 --> 00:30:36,851
Boo-yah!

741
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:38,571
Whoo!

742
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:07,933
Your Highness.

743
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:10,573
Your Highness,
can you hear me?

744
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,453
Oh, boy.
Come on, breathe.

745
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:15,013
Breathe!

746
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:18,453
Ohh. Why me?

747
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:26,734
Ooh!

748
00:31:26,814 --> 00:31:27,734
All right.

749
00:31:31,214 --> 00:31:32,494
- Ohh!
- Aah!

750
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,295
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

751
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:41,295
For the last time,

752
00:31:41,415 --> 00:31:44,295
it was not a kiss.

753
00:31:44,415 --> 00:31:45,935
Well, whatever
you call it...

754
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:48,936
it was disgusting.

755
00:31:49,016 --> 00:31:50,016
And if
you would've done

756
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:51,616
what I ordered you to do
in the first place,

757
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:52,856
we all could've
been spared

758
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:56,296
your little
kiss of life.

759
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,376
Aw!

760
00:31:57,496 --> 00:31:59,096
But now that
you're here,

761
00:31:59,176 --> 00:32:00,936
you will take me
back to the palace.

762
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:02,016
I'll have Yzma
change me back,

763
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:03,657
and then I'll start
construction

764
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:05,217
on Kuzcotopia.

765
00:32:05,337 --> 00:32:06,217
Oh, yeah.

766
00:32:06,337 --> 00:32:08,256
Ok, now, look,

767
00:32:08,336 --> 00:32:10,737
I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

768
00:32:10,817 --> 00:32:12,097
Mm-hmm.

769
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:14,417
I just think if you really
thought about it,

770
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:15,577
you'd decide
to build your home

771
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:17,057
on a different hilltop.

772
00:32:17,177 --> 00:32:18,138
And why would I
do that?

773
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:21,498
Because...

774
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:23,097
deep down,
I think you'll realize

775
00:32:23,177 --> 00:32:24,738
that you're forcing
an entire village

776
00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:26,578
out of their homes
just for you.

777
00:32:26,698 --> 00:32:29,458
And that's...

778
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:30,458
bad?

779
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:33,019
Well, yeah.

780
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:35,499
Nobody's
that heartless.

781
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,538
Mmm.

782
00:32:37,818 --> 00:32:38,818
Now take me back.

783
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:39,859
What?
Wait, wait.

784
00:32:39,939 --> 00:32:41,579
How can you
be this way?

785
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:43,419
All you care about
is building your summer home

786
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:45,259
and filling it
with stuff for you.

787
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:46,860
Uh, yeah. Doh.
Me.

788
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,180
Everyone else
in the kingdom gets it.

789
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,419
You're the only one
that doesn't seem to be

790
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:51,739
with the program,

791
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:53,179
eh, Pacha?

792
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:54,260
You know what?

793
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,380
Someday, you're going
to wind up all alone,

794
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,380
and you'll have no one
to blame but yourself.

795
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,101
Thanks for that.
I'll log that away.

796
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:02,581
Now, for the final time,

797
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:05,540
I order you to take me
back to the palace.

798
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,780
Looks to me like
you're stuck out here,

799
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,061
because unless
you change your mind,

800
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:11,581
I'm not taking you back.

801
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,261
Because unless
you change your mind,

802
00:33:15,381 --> 00:33:16,742
I'm not
taking you back.

803
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:20,101
Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.

804
00:33:20,221 --> 00:33:21,701
Huh? What?

805
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:23,542
I didn't do anything.
I didn't--

806
00:33:23,662 --> 00:33:24,782
Somebody's
throwing stuff.

807
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,742
You going to build a fire
or what? What's going on?

808
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:30,863
He's never going
to change his mind.

809
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:35,902
Ohh. How am I ever going
to get out of here?

810
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:04,824
And so,

811
00:34:04,904 --> 00:34:07,385
it is
with great sadness

812
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:09,545
that we mourn
the sudden departure

813
00:34:09,665 --> 00:34:11,105
of our beloved prince...

814
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,546
taken from us
so tragically

815
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,505
on the very eve
of his 18th birthday.

816
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:18,785
Poor little guy.

817
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:21,145
His legacy will live on
in our hearts...

818
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,426
He never had
a chance.

819
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:25,306
for all eternity.

820
00:34:26,386 --> 00:34:28,667
Well, he ain't gettin'
any deader.

821
00:34:28,787 --> 00:34:29,786
Back to work.

822
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:45,427
Kronk, darlin',

823
00:34:45,547 --> 00:34:47,707
I must admit
you had me worried

824
00:34:47,827 --> 00:34:49,867
when you mixed up
those poisons,

825
00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:52,548
but now that
Kuzco is dead,

826
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:54,068
all is forgiven.

827
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,828
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's...

828
00:34:55,908 --> 00:34:58,188
Heh. He's dead,
all right. Heh heh.

829
00:34:58,268 --> 00:35:00,468
I mean, you can't get
much deader than he--

830
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:02,068
than he is right now.

831
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:04,388
Unless, of course,
we killed him again.

832
00:35:04,508 --> 00:35:07,349
I suppose.

833
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,749
Hey, look,
the royal dresser's here.

834
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:11,109
Kronk...

835
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:14,029
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.

836
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:15,029
Kronk...

837
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:18,229
I wear a 66 long
and a 31 waist.

838
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:21,230
Kuzco is dead, right?

839
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,790
Tell me Kuzco's dead.

840
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,069
I need to hear
these words.

841
00:35:26,149 --> 00:35:28,830
Do you need to hear
all those words exactly?

842
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,390
He's still alive?

843
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,830
Well, he's not as dead
as we would've hoped.

844
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,311
Kronk...

845
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:36,351
I just thought
I'd give you the heads-up

846
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,911
in case Kuzco
ever came back.

847
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:39,910
He can't come back!

848
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,911
Yeah. That would be
kind of awkward--

849
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:43,831
especially after
that lovely eulogy.

850
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:45,471
You think?

851
00:35:45,591 --> 00:35:47,511
You and I are going out
to find him.

852
00:35:47,631 --> 00:35:49,352
If he talks,
we are through!

853
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:50,552
Now let's move!

854
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:52,592
Dad, look out!

855
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:55,551
Tipo, what is it?

856
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:57,672
I had a dream that
Dad was tied to a log

857
00:35:57,752 --> 00:35:59,352
and was careening
out of control

858
00:35:59,472 --> 00:36:01,552
down a raging river
of death!

859
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:02,912
All right, all right,
it's ok.

860
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:04,113
- It was awful!
- Shh!

861
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:05,793
It's ok, it's ok.
Tipo, calm down.

862
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,433
It was just a dream.

863
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:08,672
Your dad's fine.

864
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,472
He just went back
to see the emperor.

865
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:14,313
Oh. Like you
told him to,

866
00:36:14,393 --> 00:36:15,753
'cause you're
always right.

867
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,153
That's right.

868
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:18,954
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.

869
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:20,914
Yeah, like that
would ever happen.

870
00:36:21,074 --> 00:36:22,673
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.

871
00:36:22,793 --> 00:36:24,033
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

872
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:25,394
Yeah-huh.

873
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:28,874
Good night, you two.

874
00:36:28,954 --> 00:36:29,954
- Night, Mom!
- Night, Mom!

875
00:36:30,074 --> 00:36:31,834
- Yeah-huh. Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.

876
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:40,115
Ooh!

877
00:36:41,995 --> 00:36:42,955
B-B-Brr!

878
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,915
Uh, hey

879
00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:50,835
Thanks.

880
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:52,915
Oh.

881
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:54,476
No problem.

882
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:57,476
Feels like wool.

883
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:58,756
Yeah.

884
00:36:58,836 --> 00:37:00,116
Alpaca?

885
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:01,596
Oh, yeah, it is.

886
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,276
Oh, yeah,
I thought so.

887
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,636
It's nice.

888
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,236
My wife made it.

889
00:37:07,356 --> 00:37:08,596
Oh, she knits?

890
00:37:08,676 --> 00:37:10,317
Crochets.

891
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,557
Crochets?
Nice.

892
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:14,397
Thanks.

893
00:37:19,797 --> 00:37:21,597
So...

894
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:26,118
So, I was thinking that
when I got back to the city,

895
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:27,478
we'd, uh...

896
00:37:27,558 --> 00:37:28,678
I mean, there's
lots of hilltops,

897
00:37:28,758 --> 00:37:31,359
and maybe I might,
you know...

898
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:32,638
I--I might...

899
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,638
Are you saying...

900
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:37,238
you've changed
your mind?

901
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:39,079
Oh, well, l--I...

902
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,559
Because you know
that means

903
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,519
you're doing something
nice for someone else.

904
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:45,399
No, I know that.
I know.

905
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,399
And you're all right
with that?

906
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:48,399
Yes.

907
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
What?

908
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,120
Don't shake
unless you mean it.

909
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:10,441
All right.

910
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,602
Let's get you
back to the palace.

911
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:17,201
Oh, by the way,
thanks.

912
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,241
No...

913
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:20,961
thank you

914
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:35,322
ok.
Once we cross this bridge,

915
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:36,803
it's only an hour
to the palace.

916
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:38,243
Good, because
believe it or not,

917
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:39,483
I think I need a bath.

918
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:40,483
I believe it.

919
00:38:40,563 --> 00:38:41,923
- What was that?
- Nothing.

920
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:43,562
Ohh!

921
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:45,083
Whoa!

922
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:46,243
Kuzco!

923
00:38:47,883 --> 00:38:49,323
Kuzco!

924
00:38:49,403 --> 00:38:50,883
- Yeah?
- Quick, help me up!

925
00:38:53,004 --> 00:38:54,764
No. I don't think
I will.

926
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:56,204
You're going
to leave me here?

927
00:38:56,324 --> 00:38:58,444
Well, I was going to have
you imprisoned for life,

928
00:38:58,564 --> 00:39:00,084
but I kind of
like this better.

929
00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:02,324
I thought you were
a changed man.

930
00:39:02,404 --> 00:39:03,404
Oh, come on.
I had to say something

931
00:39:03,524 --> 00:39:05,164
to get you to take me
back to the city.

932
00:39:05,244 --> 00:39:07,085
So all of it
was a lie?

933
00:39:07,165 --> 00:39:09,205
Well, yeah.
No, wait.

934
00:39:11,364 --> 00:39:13,525
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It all was a lie.

935
00:39:13,645 --> 00:39:15,285
Toodles.

936
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:16,845
We shook hands on it!

937
00:39:20,806 --> 00:39:23,526
You know, the funny thing
about shaking hands is...

938
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:25,206
you need hands.

939
00:39:25,285 --> 00:39:26,765
Ha! ok.

940
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:28,486
Buh-bye.

941
00:39:28,606 --> 00:39:29,846
Aah!

942
00:39:29,926 --> 00:39:31,486
Are you ok?
Are you all right?

943
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:33,006
Yeah.

944
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:34,046
Yeah. I think
I'm all right.

945
00:39:34,126 --> 00:39:35,887
Good!

946
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,767
That's for going back
on your promise!

947
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:39,047
Yii!

948
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,166
Yeah. That's for
kidnapping me

949
00:39:41,286 --> 00:39:42,567
and taking me
to your village...

950
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:44,447
which I'm still gonna
destroy, by the way.

951
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:46,487
Ah ha ha ha!
No touchy.

952
00:39:46,607 --> 00:39:47,487
Ooh!

953
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:48,767
Why did I risk my life

954
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,488
for a selfish brat
like you?

955
00:39:50,608 --> 00:39:52,528
I was always taught that there
was some good in everyone,

956
00:39:52,608 --> 00:39:54,247
but, ooh,
you proved me wrong.

957
00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:56,407
Oh, boohoo.
Now I feel really bad.

958
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:57,568
Bad llama.

959
00:39:57,648 --> 00:39:59,128
I could've let you die
out there in that jungle,

960
00:39:59,248 --> 00:40:00,888
and then all my problems
would be over.

961
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:03,248
Well, that makes you
ugly and stupid.

962
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,489
Let's end this.

963
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:05,729
Ladies first.

964
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:08,888
- Aah! - Yaah!

965
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,169
Ohh!

966
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:23,449
- Aah!
- Aah!

967
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,330
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!

968
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,370
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

969
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,411
What are we
gonna do?

970
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:35,611
Aah!

971
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:37,290
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!

972
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,771
We're gonna die!
That's it for me!

973
00:40:40,891 --> 00:40:41,811
No, we're not

974
00:40:41,891 --> 00:40:43,571
Calm down.

975
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,611
I have an idea.
Give me your arm.

976
00:40:46,731 --> 00:40:49,132
Ok, now
the other one.

977
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:53,291
When I say go,
push against my back,

978
00:40:53,371 --> 00:40:55,332
and we'll walk
up the hill.

979
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,492
Ready?

980
00:40:56,612 --> 00:40:57,532
Go.

981
00:40:57,612 --> 00:40:58,532
Ow!

982
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:00,892
You did that
on purpose.

983
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:03,213
- Aah!
- No, I didn't!

984
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:04,532
Now, we're gonna have
to work together

985
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:06,612
to get out of this,
so follow my lead.

986
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:07,972
Ready?

987
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:09,172
- Right foot.
- Whose right?

988
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:10,733
Your right
or mine?

989
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:11,933
I don't care.
Mine.

990
00:41:12,013 --> 00:41:13,173
Well, why yours?

991
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:14,373
Ok, your right!
Ready?

992
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:15,373
Ok, got it.

993
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:17,214
Ok, right.

994
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:18,973
Left. Right.

995
00:41:19,053 --> 00:41:21,533
Ha ha!
Look, we're moving!

996
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,533
Aah!

997
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:25,294
Don't look down!
Now, stay with me.

998
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:26,294
Stay with me.

999
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:28,094
Right. Left.

1000
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:29,934
Right. Left.

1001
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,215
Right. Left.

1002
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:33,974
Right!

1003
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:36,694
Now what, genius?

1004
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,574
Working on it.

1005
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:40,855
Ok, here's the deal.

1006
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:42,415
Stretch out your neck,

1007
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:44,095
and I'll grab the rope.

1008
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:45,655
How do I know
you won't let me fall

1009
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:46,855
after you grab
the rope?

1010
00:41:46,935 --> 00:41:49,935
You're just gonna
have to trust me!

1011
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:54,456
You know,
it's a good thing

1012
00:41:54,576 --> 00:41:55,896
you're not
a big, fat guy,

1013
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,896
or this would be
really difficult.

1014
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,936
Aah! Aah!

1015
00:42:00,056 --> 00:42:01,376
Almost.

1016
00:42:01,456 --> 00:42:02,776
Got it!

1017
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:05,016
It's stuck.

1018
00:42:05,096 --> 00:42:08,097
Take your time.
No hurry here.

1019
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:10,937
Scorpions!
Aah ha ha!

1020
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:11,977
Kuzco!

1021
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,297
Aah!

1022
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:15,016
Oh, no!

1023
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:19,097
Uhh!

1024
00:42:19,177 --> 00:42:21,537
Aah!

1025
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:23,738
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

1026
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:25,258
Huh?

1027
00:42:26,498 --> 00:42:28,937
Aah!

1028
00:42:29,017 --> 00:42:30,578
Aah!

1029
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:33,938
Whoa!

1030
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,258
- Huh?

1031
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:46,259
Look out!

1032
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:47,699
Ohh!

1033
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:50,099
Pacha: Ohh

1034
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:51,900
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

1035
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,380
Ooh, look at me
and my bad self.

1036
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,220
I snatched you
right out of the air.

1037
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,179
"Ooh, I'm
a crumbly canyon wall,

1038
00:42:58,299 --> 00:42:59,900
and I'm taking you
with me."

1039
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,940
Well, not today, pal.

1040
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,100
Uh-huh.

1041
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,740
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1042
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,740
Uh-huh

1043
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,861
You just saved my life.

1044
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:07,901
Huh?

1045
00:43:09,341 --> 00:43:10,301
So?

1046
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:11,580
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

1047
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,940
That there is some good
in you after all.

1048
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,941
Oh, no
- Admit it.

1049
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:15,301
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.

1050
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:16,741
- Nuh-uh.
- I think there is.

1051
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:18,461
- Hey, you could've let me fall.
- Nuh-uh!

1052
00:43:18,581 --> 00:43:19,621
Come on,
what's the big deal?

1053
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:21,422
Nobody's that heartless.

1054
00:43:23,222 --> 00:43:25,142
Don't read
too much into it.

1055
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:26,741
It was a one-time thing.

1056
00:43:26,861 --> 00:43:29,302
Right. Sure.

1057
00:43:29,382 --> 00:43:31,342
Well, we better get going.

1058
00:43:31,462 --> 00:43:32,582
With that bridge out,

1059
00:43:32,662 --> 00:43:33,982
it's a 4-daywalk
to the palace.

1060
00:43:34,062 --> 00:43:35,823
What?

1061
00:43:35,943 --> 00:43:37,303
You mean you're still
taking me back?

1062
00:43:37,383 --> 00:43:38,863
I shook on it,
didn't I?

1063
00:43:38,943 --> 00:43:41,142
Well, yeah,
but I hope you realize

1064
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:42,502
that doesn't
change a thing.

1065
00:43:42,582 --> 00:43:44,463
I'm still building
Kuzcotopia

1066
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:45,503
when I get back.

1067
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,143
Well, 4 days
is a long time.

1068
00:43:47,223 --> 00:43:48,823
Who knows? Maybe
you'll change your mind.

1069
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:49,863
Uh-huh.

1070
00:43:49,943 --> 00:43:51,624
4 days.

1071
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:53,503
What are the chances
of you carrying me?

1072
00:43:53,623 --> 00:43:55,023
Not good.

1073
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:59,464
No, no, no!

1074
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,744
We've searched
every village

1075
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:02,104
surrounding the palace

1076
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:03,984
and still
no sign of Kuzco.

1077
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:06,225
Where is he?

1078
00:44:06,305 --> 00:44:07,225
Kronk!

1079
00:44:07,305 --> 00:44:08,384
Kronk here.

1080
00:44:08,464 --> 00:44:10,304
I'm getting tired.
Pull over.

1081
00:44:10,424 --> 00:44:11,704
Sure thing.
Kronk out.

1082
00:44:16,665 --> 00:44:18,545
Ooh! Aah!

1083
00:44:18,665 --> 00:44:19,786
Aah! Ohh!

1084
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:24,905
Perfect.

1085
00:44:24,985 --> 00:44:27,786
These are my best shoes.

1086
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:32,186
I hate this jungle.

1087
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:34,987
Oh, look.

1088
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:37,106
A golden-throated
small-winged warbler.

1089
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:39,186
Just one more
for exotic bird bingo.

1090
00:44:39,266 --> 00:44:40,186
Aah!

1091
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:41,907
I am loving this.

1092
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,107
Get away from me!

1093
00:44:52,187 --> 00:44:53,667
Uhh

1094
00:44:55,788 --> 00:44:56,868
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

1095
00:44:58,748 --> 00:45:00,108
No, no,
it's not you.

1096
00:45:00,188 --> 00:45:02,428
She's not the easiest
person to get close to.

1097
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:04,908
There's a wall there.
Trust me.

1098
00:45:05,028 --> 00:45:07,028
Are you talking
to that squirrel?

1099
00:45:07,148 --> 00:45:09,188
I was a junior chipmunk.

1100
00:45:09,308 --> 00:45:11,829
I had to be versed in
all the woodland creatures.

1101
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:12,949
Please continue.

1102
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:16,669
Aah!

1103
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:18,309
Why me?

1104
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:19,589
Why me?

1105
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:21,909
Hey, it doesn't always
have to be about you.

1106
00:45:22,029 --> 00:45:23,869
This poor little guy
has had it rough.

1107
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,190
Seems a talking llama

1108
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:27,150
Kronk: gave him a hard
time the other day

1109
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,710
Oh, a talking llama?

1110
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,510
Ha ha ha ha!
Do tell.

1111
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,670
Heh heh heh heh!

1112
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,910
Uh, he doesn't really
want to talk to you.

1113
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,070
Well, then
you ask him.

1114
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:41,351
I hate being
in the middle.

1115
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:42,711
Squeaky, uh...

1116
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,631
squeak, squeaker,
squeakin'.

1117
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:47,391
Aah!

1118
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:49,591
Jaguars? No kidding?
Brutal.

1119
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:58,512
Uh, could you give us
a little room here?

1120
00:45:58,592 --> 00:45:59,832
Uh, sorry.

1121
00:46:01,832 --> 00:46:03,032
Uh-uh.

1122
00:46:03,192 --> 00:46:05,592
A little bit more,
please.

1123
00:46:05,672 --> 00:46:07,632
How is this?

1124
00:46:07,752 --> 00:46:08,793
- Yeah, that's good.

1125
00:46:08,913 --> 00:46:12,553
Now ask him which way
the talking llama went!

1126
00:46:12,673 --> 00:46:16,193
Uh, squeakity-squeak,
squeakin'.

1127
00:46:27,754 --> 00:46:28,873
Low blood sugar, huh?

1128
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,794
Yeah.
It's a curse. Ha.

1129
00:46:30,914 --> 00:46:32,194
Well, as soon as we get
something to eat,

1130
00:46:32,274 --> 00:46:33,914
you're walking
the rest of the way.

1131
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,635
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut,

1132
00:46:47,715 --> 00:46:49,435
home of the mug...

1133
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:54,076
...of meat.
What'll it be?

1134
00:46:54,196 --> 00:46:56,676
Ahem. We'll have
2 specials.

1135
00:46:56,836 --> 00:46:58,475
Is that all right,
dear?

1136
00:46:58,555 --> 00:47:01,076
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.

1137
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:03,476
Hee hee hee. We're
on our honeymoon.

1138
00:47:03,556 --> 00:47:06,756
Bless you for
coming out in public.

1139
00:47:06,876 --> 00:47:08,917
So that's 2 specials.

1140
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:12,236
And an onion log.
To split.

1141
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:15,997
Ordering!
I need 2 heartburns

1142
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:19,317
and a deep-fried doorstop
on table 1 2!

1143
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,998
Ok, so I'll admit
this was a good idea.

1144
00:47:24,078 --> 00:47:27,197
When will you learn that
all my ideas are good ones?

1145
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,677
That's funny,

1146
00:47:28,757 --> 00:47:30,718
because I thought you going
into the jungle by yourself,

1147
00:47:30,798 --> 00:47:32,238
being chased by jaguars,

1148
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:33,838
lying to me to take you
back to the palace

1149
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,758
were all really bad ideas.

1150
00:47:35,918 --> 00:47:38,479
Anything sounds bad when
you say it with that attitude.

1151
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,719
Hot and crispy pill bug
for the happy couple.

1152
00:47:43,799 --> 00:47:44,719
Mazeltov

1153
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:50,439
Oh, boy.

1154
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,919
Ooh. Ugh. Bluh.

1155
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:57,159
Urp!

1156
00:47:57,279 --> 00:47:59,640
Oh, here
Let me get that for you

1157
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,160
Bleaggh! Uck!

1158
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,320
Where are you going?

1159
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,801
I'm just going to slip
into the kitchen

1160
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:06,881
and have a word
with the chef.

1161
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:08,560
You're gonna get us
thrown out.

1162
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,120
Please.
With this disguise,

1163
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,161
I'm invisible.

1164
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:18,361
Heh heh!

1165
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:20,362
We've been walking
around in circles

1166
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:21,841
for who knows how long.

1167
00:48:21,921 --> 00:48:23,841
That is the last time

1168
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:25,761
we take directions
from a squirrel.

1169
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:27,762
I should have done away
with Kuzco myself

1170
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:29,162
when I had the chance.

1171
00:48:31,682 --> 00:48:34,643
Oh, you really gotta stop
beating yourself up about that.

1172
00:48:37,162 --> 00:48:39,762
Uh-oh I'll get you
another one there, Yzma

1173
00:48:40,842 --> 00:48:42,683
You using
that fork there, pal?

1174
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:43,803
Hey, don't I know you?

1175
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:44,843
I don't think so.

1176
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,363
Wrestled you
in high school?

1177
00:48:46,443 --> 00:48:47,763
Don't remember that.

1178
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:48,883
Metal shop? I got it!

1179
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:50,923
Miss Narca's interpretive
dance--2 semesters.

1180
00:48:51,003 --> 00:48:53,803
I was usually in the back
because of my weak ankles.

1181
00:48:53,883 --> 00:48:55,643
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.

1182
00:48:55,763 --> 00:48:57,444
I don't think
we've ever met,

1183
00:48:57,524 --> 00:48:58,684
but I gotta go.

1184
00:48:58,804 --> 00:48:59,884
Don't worry.
I'll think of it.

1185
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:02,644
Look, all I know is
the food looked iffy.

1186
00:49:02,764 --> 00:49:04,684
I'm not the only one
that thinks that, I'm sure.

1187
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:05,684
Psst! Hey!

1188
00:49:05,804 --> 00:49:07,724
So I'm just
checking to make sure

1189
00:49:07,804 --> 00:49:09,484
you're going to take
the main course up a notch.

1190
00:49:09,564 --> 00:49:12,005
Is there anything
on this menu

1191
00:49:12,085 --> 00:49:13,325
that is not
swimming in gravy?

1192
00:49:13,445 --> 00:49:14,765
Hang on.
I'll go ask the chef.

1193
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,685
It's a simple
question.

1194
00:49:16,765 --> 00:49:18,725
Is there or is there
not anything edible...

1195
00:49:18,845 --> 00:49:20,085
- on this menu?
- Gah!

1196
00:49:22,485 --> 00:49:25,125
Hey, I didn't ask him
about dessert yet!

1197
00:49:25,205 --> 00:49:27,606
Hey, pal, what's your policy
on making special orders?

1198
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:29,886
All right, buster,
that's it!

1199
00:49:30,006 --> 00:49:31,366
You want a special order,
then you make it!

1200
00:49:31,446 --> 00:49:32,405
I quit!

1201
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:33,886
Yeah, but l--

1202
00:49:33,966 --> 00:49:35,566
I try and I try,
but there's no respect

1203
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:37,086
for anyone with vision.
That's it!

1204
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:38,686
There's just nothing
I can do about it!

1205
00:49:38,806 --> 00:49:39,726
Please don't go.

1206
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:42,207
3 pork combos,
extra bacon on the side,

1207
00:49:42,287 --> 00:49:43,967
2 chili cheese
samplers,

1208
00:49:44,087 --> 00:49:45,687
a basket of
liver and onion rings,

1209
00:49:45,807 --> 00:49:47,206
a catch of the day,

1210
00:49:47,286 --> 00:49:49,407
and a steak cut
in the shape of a trout.

1211
00:49:49,527 --> 00:49:50,727
You got all that, honey?

1212
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,527
3 oinkers wearing pants,
plate of hot air,

1213
00:49:52,687 --> 00:49:54,087
basket of
grandma's breakfast,

1214
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:55,288
and change the bull
to a gill, got it.

1215
00:49:55,408 --> 00:49:56,408
What's going on?

1216
00:49:56,568 --> 00:49:58,008
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.

1217
00:49:58,088 --> 00:50:01,567
What is he
doing in there?

1218
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:05,568
Unh! Come on!

1219
00:50:05,688 --> 00:50:07,408
In a minute.
I'm still hungry.

1220
00:50:07,488 --> 00:50:08,688
No, Kuzco!

1221
00:50:08,768 --> 00:50:10,369
Ok, I'll make it simple
for you.

1222
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:12,209
I'll have a spinach omelet
with wheat toast.

1223
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:13,689
- You got it?
- Can do.

1224
00:50:13,769 --> 00:50:16,248
What's taking so long?

1225
00:50:16,328 --> 00:50:17,289
Pickup!

1226
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:18,889
Kronk!
What are you doing?

1227
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,009
Kinda busy here.

1228
00:50:20,129 --> 00:50:21,169
Why am I
not surprised?

1229
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:22,289
Your order's up!

1230
00:50:22,409 --> 00:50:23,970
Ohh!

1231
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,450
Oh, well,
while you're at it,

1232
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,450
make me the special.
And hold the gravy!

1233
00:50:28,569 --> 00:50:29,489
Check. Pickup!

1234
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,009
You know what?
On second thought,

1235
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:32,170
make my omelet
a meat pie.

1236
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:33,210
Meat pie Check

1237
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,210
Kronk!

1238
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,730
Can I order the potatoes
as a side dish?

1239
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:38,811
I'll have to charge you
full price.

1240
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:39,931
Ooh!

1241
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,771
Hey, how about a side
of potatoes, my buddy?

1242
00:50:41,851 --> 00:50:43,090
You got it. Want cheese
on those potatoes?

1243
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,650
Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.

1244
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,931
Cheddar spuds
coming up.

1245
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:46,931
Spuds yes,
cheese no.

1246
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:47,971
Hold the cheese.

1247
00:50:48,091 --> 00:50:48,971
No, I want
the cheese

1248
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:50,251
Cheese me
no like.

1249
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:51,411
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!

1250
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:52,411
Come on,
make up your mind!

1251
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:53,652
Ok, ok,
on second thought...

1252
00:50:53,772 --> 00:50:55,252
Make
my potatoes a salad.

1253
00:51:12,492 --> 00:51:13,732
Excuse me. You see
that woman over there?

1254
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:17,973
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.

1255
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:24,334
Waiters: 1, 2, 3, 4

1256
00:51:24,494 --> 00:51:25,333
Happy, happy birthday

1257
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:26,893
From all of us to you

1258
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:27,893
We wish
it was our birthday

1259
00:51:28,013 --> 00:51:29,373
So we could party, too

1260
00:51:29,493 --> 00:51:30,814
Happy, happy birthday

1261
00:51:30,894 --> 00:51:31,894
May all your dreams
come true

1262
00:51:32,014 --> 00:51:34,974
Ha ha ha!
It's your birthday?

1263
00:51:37,015 --> 00:51:38,255
What are you doing?

1264
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:40,334
Look, there's 2 people
in there looking for you.

1265
00:51:40,454 --> 00:51:41,374
What?

1266
00:51:41,454 --> 00:51:42,574
A big guy
and a skinny old woman.

1267
00:51:42,694 --> 00:51:44,815
Wait. Was this woman
scary beyond all reason?

1268
00:51:44,975 --> 00:51:45,855
Oh, yeah.

1269
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,655
That's Yzma and Kronk!
I'm saved!

1270
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:49,895
Trust me, they're
not here to save you.

1271
00:51:50,015 --> 00:51:51,175
They'll take me back
to the palace.

1272
00:51:51,295 --> 00:51:52,936
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.

1273
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:54,175
I can take it from here.

1274
00:51:54,255 --> 00:51:56,735
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.

1275
00:51:56,855 --> 00:51:58,615
Kill me? Their whole world
revolves around me.

1276
00:51:58,735 --> 00:51:59,976
No. I can't let you!

1277
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:02,056
What? Wha--

1278
00:52:02,136 --> 00:52:03,896
Oh, I get it!

1279
00:52:04,016 --> 00:52:05,016
What?

1280
00:52:05,136 --> 00:52:06,577
You don't want to take me
back to the palace.

1281
00:52:06,697 --> 00:52:08,536
You want to keep me
stranded out here forever.

1282
00:52:08,616 --> 00:52:09,736
No!

1283
00:52:09,856 --> 00:52:11,336
This has all been an act,
and I almost fell for it.

1284
00:52:11,416 --> 00:52:12,536
Will you just
listen to me--

1285
00:52:12,616 --> 00:52:13,857
No, no,
you listen to me.

1286
00:52:13,937 --> 00:52:16,937
All you care about
is your stupid hilltop!

1287
00:52:17,057 --> 00:52:18,217
What?

1288
00:52:18,297 --> 00:52:19,817
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.

1289
00:52:19,897 --> 00:52:20,818
- Go!
- But--

1290
00:52:20,898 --> 00:52:23,017
Go on! Get outta here!

1291
00:52:23,097 --> 00:52:25,497
Fine! Hmph!

1292
00:52:25,577 --> 00:52:27,657
Oh, this entire mess
is all your fault.

1293
00:52:27,737 --> 00:52:29,138
What'd I do?

1294
00:52:29,258 --> 00:52:31,258
If you hadn't mixed up
those poisons,

1295
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:32,898
Kuzco would be dead now!

1296
00:52:33,018 --> 00:52:34,938
There'll be
no more diversions

1297
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:37,578
until we track that
llama down and kill him!

1298
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,698
Said I was sorry.
Can't just let it go.

1299
00:52:39,778 --> 00:52:41,898
Not even
on your birthday.

1300
00:52:42,018 --> 00:52:44,299
Kuzco must be eliminated

1301
00:52:44,419 --> 00:52:47,259
The empire will finally be
rid of that useless slug

1302
00:52:47,379 --> 00:52:49,259
You got a point

1303
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,259
Nobody really seems to care
that he's gone, do they?

1304
00:52:53,859 --> 00:52:55,579
Pacha!

1305
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,140
Pacha?

1306
00:53:39,662 --> 00:53:42,063
So this is where you came in

1307
00:53:42,183 --> 00:53:44,703
See, just like I said,
I'm the victim here

1308
00:53:44,823 --> 00:53:46,702
I didn't do anything,
and they ruined my life

1309
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:47,782
and took everything I had

1310
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:49,823
Hey, give it a rest
up there, will you?

1311
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:52,223
What? IÂ’m just telling
them what happened

1312
00:53:52,343 --> 00:53:53,783
Who you kidding, pal?

1313
00:53:53,943 --> 00:53:56,024
They saw the whole thing,
they know what happened.

1314
00:53:56,144 --> 00:53:58,144
Well, yeah, but

1315
00:53:58,264 --> 00:53:59,944
Just leave me alone.

1316
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,905
The peasant at the diner!

1317
00:54:31,025 --> 00:54:33,586
He didn't pay his check.

1318
00:54:45,306 --> 00:54:47,267
He's the peasant
who I saw leaving the city

1319
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:48,947
who disappeared
into the crowd

1320
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:50,587
with Kuzco
on the back of his cart.

1321
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:52,467
He must have taken him
back to his village,

1322
00:54:52,547 --> 00:54:54,268
so if we find the village,
we find him,

1323
00:54:54,348 --> 00:54:56,068
and if we find him,
we find Kuzco.

1324
00:54:56,148 --> 00:54:59,147
Oh, yeah,
it's all comin' together.

1325
00:54:59,507 --> 00:55:01,268
Yzma!

1326
00:55:01,388 --> 00:55:02,508
What?!

1327
00:55:02,588 --> 00:55:03,628
Aah!

1328
00:55:03,748 --> 00:55:07,148
This had
better be good!

1329
00:56:09,352 --> 00:56:10,512
Yeech.

1330
00:56:12,232 --> 00:56:14,433
So, there we were
standing on the cliff,

1331
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:16,833
and the ground
started to rumble

1332
00:56:16,913 --> 00:56:18,913
And just as
it started to go,

1333
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:20,673
he grabbed me
before I fell

1334
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:22,393
Do you believe that?

1335
00:56:22,473 --> 00:56:23,873
You know, call me crazy

1336
00:56:23,953 --> 00:56:25,873
for following this guy
all the way out here,

1337
00:56:25,953 --> 00:56:27,673
but as much
as he tries to deny it,

1338
00:56:27,753 --> 00:56:29,274
I know
there's some good in him

1339
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:32,234
Besides, I couldn't just
leave him out here all alone.

1340
00:56:32,314 --> 00:56:35,034
He's a lousy llama.

1341
00:56:35,114 --> 00:56:39,474
I mean,
a really lousy llama.

1342
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:52,235
Hey, listen, Pacha,

1343
00:56:52,355 --> 00:56:55,315
you know, what I said to you
back at the diner,

1344
00:56:55,435 --> 00:56:58,436
that--that--
I--I didn't really...

1345
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:01,356
So...you tired of
being a llama?

1346
00:57:02,476 --> 00:57:05,075
Ye-ee-ee-es!

1347
00:57:06,276 --> 00:57:08,116
Ok, we're just gonna
stop at the house

1348
00:57:08,276 --> 00:57:09,316
and get some supplies.

1349
00:57:09,436 --> 00:57:10,916
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.

1350
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:14,077
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.

1351
00:57:14,157 --> 00:57:15,117
My relatives?

1352
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:16,517
We just sent them
up to your house.

1353
00:57:16,637 --> 00:57:18,316
What did
they look like?

1354
00:57:18,436 --> 00:57:20,317
See, there was
this big guy

1355
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,717
and this older woman
who was...

1356
00:57:21,797 --> 00:57:23,837
How would
you describe her?

1357
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:25,397
Scary beyond all reason.

1358
00:57:25,477 --> 00:57:26,877
Yeah, that's it.

1359
00:57:27,558 --> 00:57:30,158
So, remind me again how
you're related to Pacha?

1360
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,957
Why, I'm his
third cousin's brother's

1361
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:35,358
wife's step-niece's
great-aunt. Heh heh.

1362
00:57:35,438 --> 00:57:38,638
Twice removed.

1363
00:57:38,758 --> 00:57:39,758
Uh-huh.

1364
00:57:39,878 --> 00:57:41,759
Isn't that right, Kronk?

1365
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:44,199
99 monkeys
jumpin' on the bed

1366
00:57:44,279 --> 00:57:47,318
One fell off
and bumped his head

1367
00:57:47,438 --> 00:57:51,119
You know, I am so sorry that
you had to come all this way,

1368
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:52,919
but as I said to you before,

1369
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:55,799
you may recall,
Pacha is not here.

1370
00:57:55,919 --> 00:57:57,400
I'll be sure and tell him
you came by.

1371
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,599
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.

1372
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:04,120
Oops. Silly me.

1373
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,520
No, no. Allow me.

1374
00:58:11,481 --> 00:58:12,921
She's hiding something.

1375
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:14,400
When I give the word,
we search the house.

1376
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,200
Ok, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.

1377
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,800
Grr!

1378
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,081
So, while we're
waiting for Paca--

1379
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:22,761
Pacha.

1380
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:24,241
Oh, yes.

1381
00:58:24,321 --> 00:58:26,762
Perhaps we can have a tour
of your lovely home.

1382
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:28,761
You know, why don't
you just come back

1383
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,321
when Pacha gets home?

1384
00:58:30,401 --> 00:58:33,442
I'm sure he'd love
to show you the...

1385
00:58:33,522 --> 00:58:35,442
Excuse me, won't you?

1386
00:58:35,522 --> 00:58:38,282
I think I left
something in the oven.

1387
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:40,283
This is my variation
of double-dutch.

1388
00:58:40,363 --> 00:58:41,723
On the signal,
we switch places.

1389
00:58:41,803 --> 00:58:43,162
Kronk, it's time!

1390
00:58:43,242 --> 00:58:44,162
ok!

1391
00:58:44,242 --> 00:58:45,962
Ohh!

1392
00:58:46,042 --> 00:58:47,883
So, we have to get
back to the palace,

1393
00:58:48,003 --> 00:58:49,443
find the lab,
and change him back.

1394
00:58:49,563 --> 00:58:50,483
Hi there!

1395
00:58:50,563 --> 00:58:51,483
Aah!

1396
00:58:51,563 --> 00:58:54,003
- That was him.
- Whoops.

1397
00:58:55,844 --> 00:58:56,963
You know what?

1398
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,203
I don't believe you're
really my great-aunt.

1399
00:58:59,323 --> 00:59:01,523
You're more like
my great-great-great...

1400
00:59:01,643 --> 00:59:03,284
Go. I'll stall them
long enough

1401
00:59:03,364 --> 00:59:04,364
for you two to get
a head start.

1402
00:59:04,524 --> 00:59:05,884
Thanks, honey.

1403
00:59:06,004 --> 00:59:07,884
You have a lovely wife.

1404
00:59:08,004 --> 00:59:09,125
They're both very pretty.

1405
00:59:09,205 --> 00:59:10,365
Great-great-
great...

1406
00:59:10,485 --> 00:59:12,964
Grr! All right!

1407
00:59:13,084 --> 00:59:14,844
Are you through?

1408
00:59:14,924 --> 00:59:15,844
...great-great-aunt.

1409
00:59:15,924 --> 00:59:16,885
So, where were we?

1410
00:59:17,005 --> 00:59:18,365
Listen, sister, we're
not leaving until--

1411
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:20,325
I show you the house.
Of course.

1412
00:59:20,405 --> 00:59:23,806
Was it a good idea to leave
your family with those two?

1413
00:59:23,886 --> 00:59:26,565
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.

1414
00:59:26,685 --> 00:59:28,565
What do you mean,
the door is stuck?

1415
00:59:28,685 --> 00:59:30,285
Try jiggling the handle.

1416
00:59:30,365 --> 00:59:32,046
There is no handle
in here.

1417
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:34,366
There's not?
Are you sure?

1418
00:59:34,486 --> 00:59:36,366
All right, I've had
enough of this.

1419
00:59:36,446 --> 00:59:38,407
Tell us where
the talking llama is

1420
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:40,006
and we'll burn your house
to the ground.

1421
00:59:40,086 --> 00:59:41,726
Uh,
don't you mean "or"?

1422
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:44,206
Tell us where
the talking llama is

1423
00:59:44,286 --> 00:59:46,287
or we'll burn your house
to the ground.

1424
00:59:46,407 --> 00:59:47,807
Well, which is it?

1425
00:59:47,887 --> 00:59:50,167
That seems like
a pretty crucial conjunction.

1426
00:59:50,247 --> 00:59:52,447
That's it!
Kronk, break the door down!

1427
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:54,447
Break it down?
Are you kidding me?

1428
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:55,847
This is hand-carved
mahogany.

1429
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:58,287
I don't care, you fool.
Get out of my way.

1430
00:59:58,407 --> 00:59:59,687
I'll break it down myself.

1431
00:59:59,767 --> 01:00:01,088
A-one

1432
01:00:01,168 --> 01:00:02,528
Ok, kids,
you know what to do.

1433
01:00:02,608 --> 01:00:03,528
2

1434
01:00:03,608 --> 01:00:04,888
Right, Mom!

1435
01:00:05,048 --> 01:00:06,048
3!

1436
01:00:07,287 --> 01:00:08,648
Aah!

1437
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:20,129
Ok, children,
on your mark,

1438
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,369
get set, go!

1439
01:00:24,009 --> 01:00:26,729
Ow! Ow! Stop it,
you little brats! Huh?

1440
01:00:28,089 --> 01:00:29,209
Ow!

1441
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:32,970
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!

1442
01:00:33,090 --> 01:00:36,249
Ha ha ha! Well,
I had a great time.

1443
01:00:36,329 --> 01:00:38,250
Let's not wait until
the next family reunion

1444
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:39,530
to get together.

1445
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,690
Kronk!

1446
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:43,290
I, uh, I gotta run.

1447
01:01:51,495 --> 01:01:53,815
Ok, why does she even
have that lever?

1448
01:01:57,096 --> 01:01:58,496
Please remain seated

1449
01:01:58,616 --> 01:02:00,495
and keep your arms and legs
in at all times

1450
01:02:01,615 --> 01:02:03,135
Aah!

1451
01:02:04,696 --> 01:02:05,696
Huh?

1452
01:02:07,736 --> 01:02:09,336
What does it look like?

1453
01:02:09,456 --> 01:02:10,816
I don't know.
Just keep looking.

1454
01:02:10,896 --> 01:02:12,177
Over here!

1455
01:02:12,297 --> 01:02:16,296
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...

1456
01:02:16,376 --> 01:02:18,216
Oh, my

1457
01:02:18,336 --> 01:02:20,857
Looking for this?

1458
01:02:22,617 --> 01:02:24,017
No! It can't be!

1459
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:26,017
How did you get
back here before us?

1460
01:02:26,098 --> 01:02:29,617
Uh...how did we, Kronk?

1461
01:02:29,697 --> 01:02:31,097
Well, you got me.

1462
01:02:31,177 --> 01:02:33,017
By all accounts,
it doesn't make sense.

1463
01:02:33,137 --> 01:02:35,298
Oh, well,
back to business.

1464
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,818
Ok, I admit it.

1465
01:02:36,898 --> 01:02:38,978
Maybe I wasn't as nice
as I should have been,

1466
01:02:39,098 --> 01:02:41,819
but, Yzma, do you
really want to kill me?

1467
01:02:41,899 --> 01:02:45,378
Just think of it
as you're being let go,

1468
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:47,458
that your life's going
in a different direction,

1469
01:02:47,538 --> 01:02:51,059
that your body's part of
a permanent outplacement.

1470
01:02:51,179 --> 01:02:53,059
Hey, that's kind of like
what he said to you

1471
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:54,299
when you got fired.

1472
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:57,299
I know. It's called
a cruel irony--

1473
01:02:57,379 --> 01:02:59,299
like my dependence
on you.

1474
01:02:59,379 --> 01:03:00,979
I can't believe
this is happening!

1475
01:03:01,059 --> 01:03:03,300
Then I bet you weren't
expecting this

1476
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:04,780
- No!
- Aah!

1477
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,340
Aha!

1478
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,900
Oh, ok.

1479
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,021
Ha ha!
Finish them off.

1480
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,380
Hey, you're
not backing down now,

1481
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,300
are you, big guy?

1482
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,501
Uh, where's the other guy?

1483
01:03:19,581 --> 01:03:20,501
Yo!

1484
01:03:20,581 --> 01:03:23,101
Sorry I'm late.
So, what'd I miss?

1485
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:24,781
Well, Yzma just
tossed me this knife

1486
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:27,221
and asked me to,
you know, take them out.

1487
01:03:27,301 --> 01:03:30,141
Then this guy popped up
and we waited for you,

1488
01:03:30,261 --> 01:03:31,221
and quite honestly--

1489
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:34,102
Kronk! Why did I think
you could do this?

1490
01:03:34,222 --> 01:03:35,582
This one simple thing.

1491
01:03:35,702 --> 01:03:37,102
It's like I'm talking
to a monkey.

1492
01:03:37,222 --> 01:03:38,262
Whoa now.

1493
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:41,382
A really, really big
stupid monkey named Kronk!

1494
01:03:41,502 --> 01:03:42,422
Ouch.

1495
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:44,022
And do you want
to know something else?

1496
01:03:44,102 --> 01:03:46,583
I've never liked
your spinach puffs.

1497
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:48,143
Never!

1498
01:03:50,423 --> 01:03:52,183
That's it.
She's going down.

1499
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:54,183
Now, now,
remember, guys.

1500
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,983
From above, the wicked shall
receive their just reward.

1501
01:03:59,423 --> 01:04:01,384
That'll work.

1502
01:04:08,904 --> 01:04:10,824
Strange.
That usually works.

1503
01:04:10,944 --> 01:04:12,104
And so does this!

1504
01:04:12,184 --> 01:04:13,944
Ah. Should have
seen that coming.

1505
01:04:14,104 --> 01:04:15,585
Whoa!

1506
01:04:15,705 --> 01:04:17,465
Aah!

1507
01:04:17,545 --> 01:04:20,385
Give me that vial!

1508
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:21,384
Oof!.

1509
01:04:21,464 --> 01:04:23,225
Ah! Ha ha!

1510
01:04:23,305 --> 01:04:24,745
Aah!

1511
01:04:28,545 --> 01:04:30,746
Oops. Clumsy me.

1512
01:04:32,186 --> 01:04:34,226
Which one? Which one?

1513
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,626
Better hurry
I'm expecting company

1514
01:04:43,106 --> 01:04:46,707
Kill them!
They murdered the emperor!

1515
01:04:46,827 --> 01:04:49,506
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me--Kuzco!

1516
01:04:49,626 --> 01:04:51,506
They're not
listening to me!

1517
01:04:51,626 --> 01:04:53,507
Just take 'em all!

1518
01:04:53,627 --> 01:04:55,427
- Yaah!
- Yaah!

1519
01:05:01,028 --> 01:05:01,948
Get them!

1520
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:03,867
Hey, I've been
turned into a cow.

1521
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:05,467
Can I go home?

1522
01:05:05,587 --> 01:05:07,228
You're excused.
Anyone else?

1523
01:05:07,348 --> 01:05:08,828
All: No, we're good.

1524
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:10,028
Get them!

1525
01:05:10,148 --> 01:05:13,308
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.

1526
01:05:15,909 --> 01:05:17,868
Uh, Pacha?
A little help!

1527
01:05:20,348 --> 01:05:21,949
Come on!
Come on!

1528
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:29,310
Aah!

1529
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:31,590
Oh, please be
something with wings.

1530
01:05:33,989 --> 01:05:36,750
Yeah! We're flyin'!

1531
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,270
Uh-oh!

1532
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:45,231
We're not getting anywhere
with you picking the vials.

1533
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:46,510
I'm picking the next one!

1534
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:48,070
Fine by me!

1535
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,230
Give me that one!

1536
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:52,231
Don't you say a word.

1537
01:05:52,351 --> 01:05:56,071
- Aah!
- Aah!

1538
01:05:57,872 --> 01:05:59,232
Quick!
Drain the canals!

1539
01:06:00,911 --> 01:06:02,151
Pacha: Open up!

1540
01:06:05,072 --> 01:06:07,432
Yay! I'm a llama again!

1541
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:08,632
Wait...

1542
01:06:10,632 --> 01:06:11,992
- Aah!
- Aah!

1543
01:06:17,752 --> 01:06:19,873
There they go!
After them!

1544
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:22,953
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!

1545
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:27,354
Aah!

1546
01:06:27,434 --> 01:06:30,593
Grr!

1547
01:06:37,954 --> 01:06:41,074
Aah!

1548
01:06:41,194 --> 01:06:44,434
Ok, only 2 left. It's
gotta be one of these.

1549
01:06:49,115 --> 01:06:50,035
No!

1550
01:06:52,595 --> 01:06:57,315
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!

1551
01:06:59,395 --> 01:07:00,315
Meow.

1552
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,795
I'll take that.

1553
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:05,316
This is the one. This'll
change you back to a human.

1554
01:07:05,436 --> 01:07:09,116
Ow! Hey, get her off!.

1555
01:07:09,236 --> 01:07:10,156
Whoa!

1556
01:07:10,236 --> 01:07:11,556
Get her off me!

1557
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:15,796
Aah! Ow!

1558
01:07:19,757 --> 01:07:20,877
Drink the potion!

1559
01:07:20,997 --> 01:07:22,757
Ok, ok! Aah!

1560
01:07:22,837 --> 01:07:25,076
Where did it go?
Where is it?

1561
01:07:25,157 --> 01:07:27,637
Looking for this?

1562
01:07:27,717 --> 01:07:29,477
Is that my voice?

1563
01:07:29,557 --> 01:07:30,957
Is that my voice?

1564
01:07:31,037 --> 01:07:33,078
Oh, well.

1565
01:07:33,158 --> 01:07:34,318
No! Don't drop it!

1566
01:07:34,438 --> 01:07:36,878
I'm not going
to drop it, you fool!

1567
01:07:36,998 --> 01:07:39,197
I'm going to drink it!

1568
01:07:39,317 --> 01:07:42,198
And once I turn back
into my beautiful self,

1569
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:44,198
I'm going to kill you!

1570
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:48,199
Ha ha ha!

1571
01:07:53,558 --> 01:07:54,479
Aah!

1572
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:55,879
Aah! Uh-oh.

1573
01:07:55,999 --> 01:07:57,359
Yzma: Aah!

1574
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,039
Aah!

1575
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,120
Aah! Aah!

1576
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,360
Uhh! Whoa!

1577
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,120
Uhh! Oh-oh-oh!

1578
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:18,521
Kuzco!

1579
01:08:18,601 --> 01:08:20,041
Be right there!
Give me a minute!

1580
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,640
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

1581
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,201
Kuzco! Whoa!

1582
01:08:26,401 --> 01:08:27,401
Kuzco!

1583
01:08:28,401 --> 01:08:31,162
Aah!

1584
01:08:31,242 --> 01:08:32,642
Oh.

1585
01:08:34,562 --> 01:08:35,641
The vial!

1586
01:08:40,402 --> 01:08:44,482
Aah!

1587
01:08:44,602 --> 01:08:46,083
For the last time,

1588
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:48,203
we did not order
a giant trampoline.

1589
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:49,882
You know, pal, you
could have told me that

1590
01:08:49,962 --> 01:08:51,642
before I set it up.

1591
01:08:52,763 --> 01:08:55,443
Aah!

1592
01:08:55,563 --> 01:08:57,723
Aah! Uhh--

1593
01:08:57,803 --> 01:08:59,043
Huh? Ha ha ha.

1594
01:08:59,123 --> 01:09:01,564
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1595
01:09:01,644 --> 01:09:03,323
Hoo hoo hee hee
ha ha ha--

1596
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:08,244
The vial!

1597
01:09:08,324 --> 01:09:10,404
You thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

1598
01:09:27,525 --> 01:09:29,246
Ah ha ha ha ha!

1599
01:09:29,326 --> 01:09:30,446
I win.

1600
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:31,486
Whoa.

1601
01:09:33,645 --> 01:09:35,605
Got it!

1602
01:09:35,685 --> 01:09:38,606
What are the odds of that
trapdoor leading me out here?

1603
01:09:40,486 --> 01:09:42,086
Yeah!

1604
01:09:43,246 --> 01:09:44,167
Uhh.

1605
01:09:46,206 --> 01:09:48,766
Here, uh, let me
get this for you.

1606
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:54,247
Well, see ya
on the other side.

1607
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:04,847
Old man: Oh, now,
you--you

1608
01:10:04,927 --> 01:10:06,888
you stop being
so hard on yourself.

1609
01:10:06,968 --> 01:10:07,888
All is forgiven.

1610
01:10:07,968 --> 01:10:09,128
You're sure?

1611
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:11,568
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window,

1612
01:10:11,688 --> 01:10:13,209
and it won't be the last.

1613
01:10:13,329 --> 01:10:15,368
What can I say?
I'm a rebel.

1614
01:10:15,448 --> 01:10:16,688
Whoa-ho-ho, tiger.

1615
01:10:16,768 --> 01:10:19,008
Oh! Hey, I got to
use that arm later.

1616
01:10:19,088 --> 01:10:20,809
Ok, buddy, take care.

1617
01:10:20,889 --> 01:10:23,409
Ha ha.
Ah, he's a sweet guy.

1618
01:10:33,249 --> 01:10:35,770
So, you lied to me

1619
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:37,770
I did?

1620
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:40,050
Yeah. You said
when the sun

1621
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,370
hits this ridge
just right,

1622
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:42,930
these hills sing.

1623
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,130
Well, pal, I was dragged
all over those hills,

1624
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:48,570
and I did not hear
any singing.

1625
01:10:50,411 --> 01:10:51,371
So

1626
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:53,011
I'll be building
my summer home

1627
01:10:53,131 --> 01:10:57,091
on a more magical hill.
Thank you.

1628
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:02,131
Hmm. Couldn't pull the wool
over your eyes, huh?

1629
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,012
No, no, I'm sharp,
I'm on it.

1630
01:11:04,092 --> 01:11:05,292
Looks like you
and your family

1631
01:11:05,412 --> 01:11:07,652
are stuck on that tuneless
hill top forever, pal.

1632
01:11:16,612 --> 01:11:19,053
You know, I'm pretty sure
I heard some singing

1633
01:11:19,133 --> 01:11:21,613
on the hill next to us.

1634
01:11:21,773 --> 01:11:23,133
In case you're interested.

1635
01:11:27,893 --> 01:11:29,493
Ha! Boom, baby!

1636
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:31,733
Ha! Boom, baby!

1637
01:11:35,814 --> 01:11:37,254
You'd be the coolest dude

1638
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,653
In the nation

1639
01:11:38,773 --> 01:11:40,534
Or the hippest cat
in creation

1640
01:11:40,654 --> 01:11:43,734
But if you ain't got friends,
then nothing's worth the fuss

1641
01:11:45,454 --> 01:11:47,414
A perfect world
will come to be

1642
01:11:47,494 --> 01:11:49,815
When everybody here
can see

1643
01:11:49,935 --> 01:11:52,135
That a perfect world
begins and ends

1644
01:11:52,255 --> 01:11:54,374
A perfect world
begins and ends

1645
01:11:54,494 --> 01:11:57,215
A perfect world
begins and ends with us

1646
01:11:58,495 --> 01:12:00,255
" My acorn
is missing."

1647
01:12:00,335 --> 01:12:02,336
Squeak squeakin'
squeak squeakity.

1648
01:12:02,456 --> 01:12:03,976
" Did you eat
the acorn?"

1649
01:12:04,096 --> 01:12:06,176
Squeaker squeak
squeak squeakin'?

1650
01:12:06,296 --> 01:12:08,095
"You owe me
a new acorn."

1651
01:12:08,175 --> 01:12:10,456
Squeak squeak squeak
squeak squeaker--

1652
01:12:12,576 --> 01:12:13,696
Squeakin'.

1653
01:12:13,196 --> 01:12:13,816
I'm so proud of you guys.

1654
01:12:14,616 --> 01:12:16,616
