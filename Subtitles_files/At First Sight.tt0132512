1
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,799
- So, Betsy, why am I doing this?
- You're tired, stressed,

2
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:42,720
and they'll carry you out of the office
on a stretcher if you don't get some rest.

3
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:46,516
- Duncan can take care of things.
- Duncan? Are you kidding me?

4
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:51,646
He is your partner. And believe it or not,
he is just as worried about you as I am.

5
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:56,776
Go. It's a vacation. You're late already.
I won't let you put this off this time.

6
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:59,612
OK, OK, I'm not gonna put it off.

7
00:01:59,737 --> 00:02:03,032
But I am taking those plans.
They're not good enough.

8
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:06,619
Now, how do you know that this spa
is any good anyway?

9
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,788
Fine. I-l'm fine.

10
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:13,751
- Don't forget to exercise.
- Exercise? Exercise is not rest.

11
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,381
- Sure you know where you're going?
- Yes. I'm very good with directions.

12
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:21,592
Betsy, I'm completely lost. I'm sorry.

13
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:25,513
I thought I was on 128,

14
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:29,726
but I'm in the middle of the woods,
and, uh, I don't like it.

15
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,105
Yeah. Hang on a second.

16
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:37,150
OK, wait. I've got... I've got the map.

17
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:41,696
I've got the map here. You know what?
There's... there's no Bear Mountain.

18
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:44,574
There's no sign. I've been looking for it.

19
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,326
Yeah, I did. I... I...

20
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:50,163
Oh! Wow, wait. There's the sign. I got it.

21
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:53,249
All right. I'll see you in a week.

22
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,418
OK, thanks. Bye.

23
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:12,977
Your room's in the Timber Lodge,
which is to the left.

24
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:18,024
In the main lodge, we have a full
weight room, Lifecycles, step machines,

25
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:22,153
spa, yoga, aerobics, cycling workouts.

26
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,239
I was really hoping for, like, a quick fix.

27
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:28,868
Uh, do you have anything
that involves just lying down?

28
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:32,038
- A massage?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:35,625
Um, I'll have one a day, and not too early.

30
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,169
How's 10am?

31
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:39,837
Eleven?

32
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:42,423
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.

33
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:47,011
Oh!

34
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,931
Virgil! Oh!

35
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:52,016
God! There... Oh!

36
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:54,727
No, no, no, no. Harder. Just right...

37
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:55,895
Oh!

38
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,358
No, you can't stop. Just a little more...

39
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:02,860
- Come on, time's up.
- No, no... Oh!

40
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:08,116
Virgil, you have to come live with me.

41
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:10,827
What would your husband say?

42
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:13,496
- I'll see you.
- Oh...

43
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,582
That's it. I'm getting a divorce!

44
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,337
- Amy, are you out there?
- Yeah?

45
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,506
Come on in.

46
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,180
- Hi, I'm Virgil.
- Hi.

47
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:35,184
Take your clothes off
and hop up on the table. I'll be right there.

48
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,270
You sound like a genius at this.

49
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:41,858
Oh, yeah, Einstein, Gandhi...
Virgil Adamson, massage therapist.

50
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:47,947
Do you want me...
sunny-side up or down?

51
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:51,701
Mm, on your stomach, I think.

52
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,373
I'm gonna start off... somewhat deep.

53
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:03,796
And, uh, you let me know
if you want anything deeper.

54
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,089
Deeper is good.

55
00:05:05,214 --> 00:05:07,759
Where I come from, all you get is shallow.

56
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,720
Ah! A New Yorker.

57
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:15,600
Now, how do you know that?

58
00:05:15,725 --> 00:05:18,102
Oh, it's all here in the shoulders.

59
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:23,775
Here's that honking horn
of the taxi you missed.

60
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,611
Here's the... rumble of the subway.

61
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:29,822
Right in here is the screech of the wheels

62
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:33,326
cos you're late,
and that's why you have that tension.

63
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:36,204
You... get into the city very often?

64
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:41,084
Do you want to talk or a... massage?

65
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,878
Shutting up now.

66
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:56,391
Mm-mm.

67
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:05,817
Mm...

68
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,742
That too deep?

69
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:18,663
No, um... It's... fine.

70
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,959
Oh, it is too deep.

71
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:26,838
Maybe we should stop for today.

72
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:29,799
Here's a Kleenex.

73
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:33,219
I don't... I don't know why I'm crying.

74
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:41,060
There must've been a lot of stuff built up.
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:42,562
Sure.

76
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:47,650
I'm gonna go now,
unless you'd like me to stay.

77
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,736
Could you, please?

78
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:52,697
Oh, sure... Sure.

79
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:02,915
Do you always make the girls cry?

80
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,333
Always.

81
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:07,003
Just relax.

82
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,129
OK.

83
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:18,282
Hey, Virgil.

84
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:20,618
- Virgil!
- Caroline! You look good.

85
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:24,747
Oh, thank you. What a compliment!
See you tomorrow.

86
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,543
Hey, Virgil!

87
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:32,797
Can I take your bag?
I'll meet you in the lobby.

88
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:36,342
Hey! Virgil!

89
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,554
- Hi!
- Hi.

90
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,347
It's... Amy...

91
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:43,516
- Amy Benic.
- Oh. Yeah.

92
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,518
I didn't recognise you
with your clothes on.

93
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:50,398
You fell asleep,
so I thought it best if I just left.

94
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:52,567
Oh, thank you.

95
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:57,280
My God, you're the skater.
I saw you... Iast night driving in.

96
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:58,406
Really?

97
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:01,576
Yeah! You're good with that stick.
Are you on a team?

98
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:04,328
Are you a hockey fan?

99
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:08,458
I don't know. I don't really know
much about it, but it looks like fun.

100
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,294
I skated as a kid,
but I've got two left feet.

101
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:15,506
Well, this is my ride.

102
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:18,593
Tommy?

103
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,554
Hey, Virge.

104
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:27,185
I just wanted to apologise
for falling apart like that.

105
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,521
Um, I was just in a weird place. Sorry.

106
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:33,983
- And now?
- Now I'm feeling good.

107
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,277
So I wanted to thank you.

108
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:40,573
- For making you cry?
- No. I made me cry.

109
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:43,284
But you were very kind to me. Thank you.

110
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,953
Virgil! Virgil, let's move it.

111
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:49,290
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.
I booked another massage.

112
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:52,210
- OK. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Nice to see you.

113
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:55,004
OK. All right.

114
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:59,217
See you.

115
00:09:59,634 --> 00:10:00,760
Oh, my God.

116
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,971
What?

117
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:06,974
I'm sorry. I didn't... realise...

118
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:08,893
Wow.

119
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:12,146
- Hey, you already apologised once.
- Oh, God.

120
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:16,776
- No need to overdo it.
- OK. I'll see you tomorrow.

121
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:18,861
See you tomorrow.

122
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,071
Bye.

123
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:57,567
Jessie, get off the bed.

124
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:03,531
There you are. Come here, boy.

125
00:11:03,656 --> 00:11:07,452
You're more like a sleeping-eye dog
than a Seeing Eye dog.

126
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:11,748
Come here, you. Come on.

127
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:14,292
There's a game on.

128
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,461
Come on.

129
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:20,506
Hey, I met a girl today.

130
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:24,844
- She had an amazing voice. It was
- A charade sheet. OK!

131
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:27,597
smooth like butter.

132
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:31,601
And she smelled like...
cinnamon and nutmeg.

133
00:11:31,726 --> 00:11:35,438
Sounds more like a recipe
for a coffee cake than a girl.

134
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:39,442
You're here! I didn't hear you.

135
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:44,447
As this game starts, Sundstrom
goes for the puck. Winds it around.

136
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:47,533
- So, how are the kids?
- Oh, the usual.

137
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:50,036
They need a lot of attention. Here.

138
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:56,125
- So, who's the girl?
- Oh, just a spa girl. Client.

139
00:11:57,627 --> 00:11:59,629
Gone in a week.

140
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:04,509
Look, if you like coffee cake that much,
we can sprinkle cinnamon on Jessie.

141
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:08,137
- Too old for me.
- Who? Jessie or the girl?

142
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:10,556
Not jealous of a coffee cake, are you?

143
00:12:11,557 --> 00:12:14,185
- Coke?
- I'm fine.

144
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,270
Your lunch is ready.

145
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:21,109
- Chicken's at 3 o'clock.
- Rice is at 6 o'clock. Beans are at 9,...

146
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:24,654
- ..and the news is at 1 1 .
- One day, I'm gonna switch 'em.

147
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:29,283
Yeah. And one day I'll play forward
for the New York Rangers.

148
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:33,413
- You need better jokes.
- Or a new sister.

149
00:12:33,538 --> 00:12:36,082
Mm, I'd work on the jokes if I were you.

150
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,585
Aren't you gonna watch some hockey?

151
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:43,631
You want to grade some spelling tests?
I'm next door if you need me.

152
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:45,842
OK. Thanks a lot.

153
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:49,470
So, this girl...

154
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:52,640
We talked for a long time at the bus stop.

155
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,811
She thought I could see.

156
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:02,483
I really love coffee cake.

157
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:38,186
Oh! Oh! Whoa! Oh!

158
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,354
Oh, shoot.

159
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:46,402
Coming, coming!

160
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:49,280
Hang on! Hang on. OK.

161
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:53,451
Coming!

162
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,580
- Hi.
- Oh, my God. Hi.

163
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:59,457
My turn to apologise.

164
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:02,877
- I should have told you I was blind.
- Well,

165
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:07,090
we're even.
Apologies cancel each other out.

166
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:11,636
You wanna come in? Sorry. I just got out
of the shower. I have to change.

167
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:13,805
Promise I won't look.

168
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:16,307
Uh-huh!

169
00:14:18,643 --> 00:14:22,939
Uh... I sort of spilled
some stuff on the floor.

170
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:28,361
Here, why don't you sit down on the bed?
I'm just gonna go change. Be right back.

171
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,280
All right.

172
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:35,451
You didn't have to come all the way
back up here just to apologise.

173
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:39,372
- I was in the neighbourhood.
- You were in the neighbourhood?

174
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:41,499
Oh, all right, I'll confess.

175
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:47,338
I was watching hockey with my dog,
and, um... I was describing you.

176
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:49,048
What?

177
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:55,054
I was describing how great you smelled.
My sister thought I was describing a cake.

178
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:57,598
Anyway, I started thinking of you here

179
00:14:57,724 --> 00:15:01,769
in the midst of your tofu shake
and really boring yoghurt.

180
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:05,732
I thought maybe you'd want to
get some air, take a walk around town.

181
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:10,486
- Just see what we see.
- See what we see?

182
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:14,615
- Figure of speech.
- You mean, right here, right now?

183
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:18,870
- Great! I'm blind and you're deaf.
- What a pair.

184
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:21,914
52 lampposts... Pinecrest.

185
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,334
Up here on our left
is my sister Jennie's school.

186
00:15:26,169 --> 00:15:29,005
She's really great with these kids.

187
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,758
You see that guy across the street?

188
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:34,469
- Over in the doorway.
- Uh...

189
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:37,180
- He's chain-smoking, right?
- Oh, yeah!

190
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:41,392
That's Bruce. We watch
the game together sometimes.

191
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:47,315
Here comes Nancy. She's the librarian.
Gets me any book I want in Braille.

192
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,110
- Hey, Nancy!
- Hey, Virgil! I got that book in for you.

193
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,988
Still haven't got that old jalopy fixed.

194
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:56,866
If I got it fixed,
how would you know it was me?

195
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:57,950
Hi.

196
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:01,996
- Nancy, this is Amy. Amy, Nancy.
- Hi, Amy. Nice to meet you.

197
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:05,083
- Have fun.
- Be careful, honey. He's all hands.

198
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,251
- Be nice.
- Yeah!

199
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:13,800
Nice town you have here.
You're very popular with the ladies.

200
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:16,928
Oh, yeah. Moved here when I was eight.

201
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:20,098
They figured it was a good place
for me to grow up in.

202
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,934
It's a bit geriatric, but... it works.

203
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,064
Do you mind me asking
how long you've been blind?

204
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:30,149
No, not at all.

205
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:35,405
It started when I was one.
Completely gone by the time I was three.

206
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,490
Congenital cataracts,

207
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:41,828
with a dose of retinitis pigmentosa
thrown in for good measure.

208
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:42,704
Huh.

209
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:46,708
So... So, you see no bright lights?

210
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,750
Nothing?

211
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,836
Nope. Blind as a bat.

212
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:54,632
Actually, blinder. Um, bats emit sonar.
I wish I had that sonar.

213
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:57,719
I don't have a sixth sense. Or a fifth one.

214
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:00,179
Never wrote a book like Helen Keller.

215
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:02,849
Wish I could play the piano
like Ray Charles.

216
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:06,686
I really wish I could sing
like Stevie Wonder. But I can't.

217
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:09,814
Got it. Huh.

218
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:18,156
So, what do you, uh, think,
of our, uh, little Sleepy Hollow?

219
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:23,202
It has a very nice feel to it.
Genuine lines, good use of space.

220
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:28,207
I'd do something more stimulating with
the newer buildings, but that's just me.

221
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:29,959
Wow!

222
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:33,838
What's you?
Are you a writer for Architectural Digest?

223
00:17:33,963 --> 00:17:36,424
Um, no, I'm actually an architect.

224
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:39,552
That's what I do.
I have a partnership in New York.

225
00:17:39,677 --> 00:17:41,471
- Really?
- Yeah.

226
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:43,056
Wow.

227
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:46,517
Well...

228
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:49,020
This is the end.

229
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:51,105
Guess we should go back.

230
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,692
Well, what's out there,
past the end of the street?

231
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:57,820
Nothing.

232
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:03,826
Well, there is a, um,
old run-down building off to the left.

233
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:06,496
Kind of like an old gas station.

234
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:10,583
Would you describe it to me?

235
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,752
OK.

236
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:15,922
Um... It's kind of dilapidated

237
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:20,718
and it's sitting in between
two great big trees in a field.

238
00:18:20,843 --> 00:18:25,348
The trees are like a man and a woman.
The man is asking the woman to dance.

239
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:29,727
And the woman is... on her toes,
trying to decide if she's got the guts.

240
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:34,690
Oh, God, I'm an idiot.
What a stupid description!

241
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:36,609
No.

242
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:40,154
I really like the... dancing trees.

243
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,869
We better get going. It's starting to rain.

244
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:49,706
Well, there's a little breeze, but l...

245
00:18:50,331 --> 00:18:52,500
Oh, my God.

246
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,502
OK. Oh, my God!

247
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,754
Uh, OK. Wait, let's go this way.

248
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:06,222
Oh... Oh, my.

249
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:09,809
I can't believe how fast that happens.

250
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:14,021
- Oh, do you like the rain? I love the rain.
- Well, sometimes.

251
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:16,190
I love the rain.

252
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,530
Oh, I feel everything at once.

253
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:26,576
It's the best way for me
to understand dimension in a room.

254
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,119
Do you hear it?

255
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:32,123
Coming down off the ceiling,
all the walls?

256
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,001
Do you hear that?

257
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:37,962
It's hitting a puddle.

258
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:41,549
It's echoing the sound across.
There's no walls.

259
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:47,472
What's that? Oh, a drainpipe.

260
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:50,391
You hear that? That's high up.

261
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:51,976
Rafters?

262
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:53,102
Yeah.

263
00:19:56,355 --> 00:20:01,069
It's got its own rhythm. You hear that?
Ping, ping, ping, ping, ping.

264
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:04,197
And that... that sound way up.

265
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:08,201
Uh, well, it looks like there's...

266
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:13,206
No, no, just listen. No, come here.
Close your eyes.

267
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,126
Listen with your whole body.

268
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:23,883
Feel it? Right in your chest.

269
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:27,470
Oh, that's beautiful, that, uh,

270
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:31,265
that little sound like a... Iike a whisper.

271
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:33,351
Mm.

272
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:37,397
It's the wind blowing a branch
across the windows.

273
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:43,986
I can feel everything when it rains.

274
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,988
I wish it would rain inside.

275
00:20:46,322 --> 00:20:48,366
Rain all around us.

276
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:52,745
Einfühlung.

277
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,417
- What's that?
- It's an architectural term.

278
00:20:57,542 --> 00:21:01,129
It means... to share a feeling.

279
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,176
I-l don't think I've ever felt like this before.

280
00:21:23,026 --> 00:21:26,154
I wanted you to know I was smiling.

281
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:54,766
Virgil, before you lost your sight,

282
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:59,353
do you remember...
seeing anything at all?

283
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:02,440
I do. One memory.

284
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:07,362
People say it's the clouds.

285
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:10,698
But I don't think it was.

286
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:13,534
Cos I could touch it.

287
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:16,537
It was a

288
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,374
puffy thing.

289
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,001
Must've been important.

290
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:24,337
It's a good memory.

291
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:28,383
I remembered it all these years.

292
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:32,011
How 'bout you? What...

293
00:22:32,136 --> 00:22:33,930
What's your first memory?

294
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:36,432
OK.

295
00:22:38,393 --> 00:22:39,394
Um...

296
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:45,942
I was two, or maybe three.

297
00:22:49,153 --> 00:22:52,490
And I remember being at the beach
with my parents.

298
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:55,910
It was cold outside.

299
00:22:56,244 --> 00:23:02,083
So, I had to snuggle down
between the both of them in the sand.

300
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:06,045
And we all watched
the sun set over the horizon.

301
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:08,256
Horizon. That's a tough one.

302
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,260
I can't feel it. I don't know what it is.

303
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:15,346
It's the line
where the earth meets the sky.

304
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:19,267
It's the end of the world.

305
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:22,520
When I was a kid, l-l used to think

306
00:23:22,645 --> 00:23:25,982
that if I walked far enough,
I could actually reach it.

307
00:23:26,107 --> 00:23:28,735
I thought that if I could,

308
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,529
if I could stand on it

309
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,158
and just look out over the edge,

310
00:23:35,616 --> 00:23:39,412
that I would be able to see
something more beautiful

311
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:42,331
than anything I had ever known.

312
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:49,005
No-one's ever explained horizon
to me before so I could understand it.

313
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:08,024
- You're very good at what you do.
- It's what I do.

314
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:11,778
- It's what I can do.
- Do you enjoy it?

315
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:15,031
Sometimes I enjoy it.

316
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:18,368
Some times more than others.

317
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:22,288
And this time?

318
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:24,332
This time...

319
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:32,173
This time I feel like I can... see everything.

320
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:33,299
Everything?

321
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:38,429
Time's up.

322
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:43,059
And I've got Mr Ketchum.

323
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:45,395
All 200lbs of him.

324
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,482
- I felt like we were just getting started.
- Yeah.

325
00:24:49,607 --> 00:24:51,651
Me, too.

326
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:56,823
Amy?

327
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:03,329
Cos... you're a client,

328
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:06,499
I'm not supposed to get that close to you.

329
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:08,918
You're not?

330
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:11,963
So, what does that mean?

331
00:25:12,088 --> 00:25:16,843
It means you have to stop paying me,
and come over to my house for dinner

332
00:25:16,968 --> 00:25:19,220
so we can finish the massage.

333
00:25:32,817 --> 00:25:33,985
Hello?

334
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,821
- Hi, Virgil, it's Amy.
- Amy, hey!

335
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:39,449
You're in for a real surprise. I'm cooking.

336
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:41,743
So, what time are you coming over?

337
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:42,869
Virgil,

338
00:25:42,994 --> 00:25:46,497
I can't come. I'm so sorry.
I'm calling from the road.

339
00:25:46,622 --> 00:25:49,917
I have to go back into the city.
An emergency's come up.

340
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:52,628
This project that I'm in charge of

341
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:56,299
is going down the drain
and... I gotta go back in and save it.

342
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,551
I'm... Goddamn, I'm sorry.

343
00:25:58,676 --> 00:26:00,678
- But I'm gonna come back, OK?
- OK.

344
00:26:00,803 --> 00:26:02,972
- I feel terrible, but...
- Bye.

345
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:05,141
OK. Bye.

346
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:16,486
Stupid!

347
00:26:16,944 --> 00:26:20,365
You're right, Mr Falk.
Something is missing.

348
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,911
We realise that now.
We just need time to find out what.

349
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:28,373
Fine, but y'all know
the schedule we're on.

350
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:31,751
We will take care of it.
We won't let you down.

351
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:35,671
OK, all right.

352
00:26:35,797 --> 00:26:40,385
Just don't... don't say it. I know you were
never happy with the design anyways.

353
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,470
I wasn't gonna say it.

354
00:26:42,595 --> 00:26:46,557
Yeah, but you'd have tinkered with it
till it went away, right?

355
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:48,976
You know what this means to us.

356
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:51,979
I know. I know the whole speech.

357
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:54,148
Good. Then, I won't have to make it.

358
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:57,610
Now the guy's hooked,
you've got your second chance.

359
00:26:57,735 --> 00:27:01,572
By the way,
we all deserve a second chance.

360
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:03,324
OK.

361
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:05,618
Now, see these two trees?

362
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:08,996
It's time to give them a second chance.
They'll stay.

363
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:13,918
We'll design everything around them.
They are the most beautiful thing there.

364
00:27:14,043 --> 00:27:18,715
And, in the car, I thought of
an addition for the TriBeCa lobby.

365
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,386
- It'll add so much life to the place.
- Uh, so what's... going on here?

366
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:26,222
We sent off Hydra,
the three-headed monster.

367
00:27:26,347 --> 00:27:28,808
We get back Mary Poppins in return?

368
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:31,769
What, I can't have a couple of ideas?

369
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:37,442
OK, OK. You know, I had my little trip.

370
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:42,030
I rested, I exercised.
Thank you very much, Betsy.

371
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:44,782
And, uh,

372
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:46,951
I met a guy.

373
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:51,330
- This is too modern for me.
- Come on, Betsy!

374
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:54,042
We're all friends. Sit down, sit down,

375
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:57,045
or you'll be fired.

376
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:59,589
You met a guy? That's...

377
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:02,550
- That's great. Great... Super...
- Thank you.

378
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:04,927
So, uh, spill the beans.

379
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:08,765
Nothing to spill, you know.
He's a great guy. He's smart,

380
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,558
funny,

381
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:11,893
blind.

382
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,938
Oh, I thought you said he was blind.
Uh, he was blond?

383
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:17,607
That, too.

384
00:28:21,027 --> 00:28:24,989
I'm sorry. That's fun... Uh, blind blind?

385
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:30,703
Like... Iike... white cane,
tap, tap, tap blind? Come on!

386
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:34,123
I know you like a challenge.
Hell, you married me, but...

387
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:36,626
OK. Thank you
for your understanding, sir.

388
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:39,712
OK. It's not... my problem any more.

389
00:28:39,837 --> 00:28:42,298
Duncan, don't be a jerk.

390
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:43,716
You still work here?

391
00:28:51,516 --> 00:28:54,310
Everyone's gone for the day.

392
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:58,523
That's OK. I'm just gonna work here
a little bit longer.

393
00:28:58,648 --> 00:29:00,692
Just doing something.

394
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:10,451
What?

395
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:14,914
I just want to know more about the guy.
Is that so wrong?

396
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,793
Listen, my father had severe cataracts
a few years back.

397
00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:22,922
Do you have any idea
what you're getting into?

398
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:30,847
Have you ever listened to the rain?
I mean, really listened?

399
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:34,684
This... Iike that smell-the-roses thing?

400
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,853
No, it is not.

401
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:41,899
Betsy, I've... for the past five years,

402
00:29:42,025 --> 00:29:45,570
Iived with a man who has
the emotional content of a soap dish.

403
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:48,072
The only time I ever saw him cry

404
00:29:48,197 --> 00:29:51,868
was when he was doing
our tax returns three years ago.

405
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:53,786
I need more than that.

406
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:57,582
And there's something about this guy...

407
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:03,588
He makes me feel like I'm... I'm waking up
after being asleep for a long time.

408
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:06,924
I mean, I'm inspired again.
I can draw again.

409
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:11,471
And... the way that he touches me...

410
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,807
Oh... Here we go, it's the sex.

411
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:17,560
No, no! No sex. Not yet!

412
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,020
No...

413
00:30:19,937 --> 00:30:25,860
It's just that when... when he touches me,
I feel like he does it... to know me better,

414
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:28,404
not to get something from me.

415
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:31,240
And when he listens to me,

416
00:30:31,366 --> 00:30:35,244
it's as though my words
are the last sounds on the planet.

417
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,456
And even though
he doesn't know what I look like,

418
00:30:38,581 --> 00:30:41,250
I feel like he really knows who I am.

419
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:45,838
He just moves me, that's all.

420
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:49,050
Does he have a brother?

421
00:31:03,356 --> 00:31:05,817
Whoo! Wayne Gretzky, look out!

422
00:31:05,942 --> 00:31:08,152
Amy?

423
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:10,780
How long have you been here?

424
00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:13,157
About an hour.

425
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:17,662
No. I went up to the lodge
and you weren't there.

426
00:31:17,787 --> 00:31:20,289
So, I guessed, and here you are.

427
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,335
- You're really good at that.
- Thanks.

428
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,671
My dad taught me.

429
00:31:27,797 --> 00:31:30,466
So, how do you like my pond?

430
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,844
It's beautiful.

431
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:38,599
I'm so surprised you're here.
You want to go skating?

432
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:40,393
I didn't bring any skates.

433
00:31:40,518 --> 00:31:43,813
- Come on. It's all right.
- Wait, what do you mean?

434
00:31:43,938 --> 00:31:47,316
- Uh, this is ice. I don't have any skates.
- Come on.

435
00:31:47,984 --> 00:31:50,653
I used to take my sister Jennie out
like this.

436
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:53,489
Take my stick.
Put it over there on that branch.

437
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:55,033
OK.

438
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,329
- Yeah? Ready?
- Uh...

439
00:32:00,455 --> 00:32:04,667
Now, don't think about skating.
Think about gliding.

440
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:08,588
So, uh, don't think about the ice.
Don't look down.

441
00:32:08,713 --> 00:32:13,217
Take your mind off it. Tell me,
how did you become an architect?

442
00:32:13,342 --> 00:32:14,343
OK.

443
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:18,598
I was in art school in college and...

444
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:20,975
- Aaaah...
- Don't look down.

445
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,354
I didn't know what I was
going to do with myself.

446
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:29,942
And then I met this guy who was
an architectural grad student.

447
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,363
And he opened up
this whole new world for me.

448
00:32:33,488 --> 00:32:35,531
Don't look down.

449
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:40,286
So, me and the grad student
got married and

450
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:45,249
we started a company... Oh, sorry.
But we're divorced now. It's OK.

451
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:48,169
Uh, we got divorced about a year ago.

452
00:32:48,336 --> 00:32:52,548
But we're still working together,
which is kinda crazy...

453
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:55,093
What? Um, wait. Oh!

454
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:57,261
Whoa!

455
00:32:57,387 --> 00:32:59,806
- You OK?
- Yeah.

456
00:33:00,264 --> 00:33:01,349
Yeah.

457
00:33:09,023 --> 00:33:10,983
Did you think I meant to do that?

458
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:14,195
Yeah. Did you?

459
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:16,239
Yeah.

460
00:33:20,076 --> 00:33:22,370
Oh, God, this is so hard.

461
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:24,247
What?

462
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:26,666
Um, well,

463
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:31,462
I'm looking at you, right?
And there's this, uh,...

464
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:34,549
..there's this... thing I do with my eyes,

465
00:33:34,674 --> 00:33:37,844
when I'm glancing out
from under my eyelashes

466
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:40,304
and sort of giving you this sexy look.

467
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:44,183
And then I realise it doesn't matter to you.

468
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:46,352
No, it doesn't matter.

469
00:33:48,604 --> 00:33:49,939
Let me see.

470
00:33:56,821 --> 00:33:58,865
Eyes.

471
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:03,327
Nose.

472
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:07,040
Mouth.

473
00:34:10,793 --> 00:34:12,920
You're very beautiful.

474
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:17,300
Thank you. So are you.

475
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:55,815
# The memory of our lives

476
00:35:57,108 --> 00:36:01,279
# No, no
They can't take that away from me

477
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:24,844
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm in the bathroom.

478
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:28,181
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

479
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:31,017
Um... I'm Jennie, Virgil's sister.

480
00:36:31,142 --> 00:36:33,311
Hi, I'm Amy Benic.

481
00:36:34,312 --> 00:36:36,939
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

482
00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:41,235
- Hi.
- Hi. Here, here.

483
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:46,449
So, I was at the market before school,
and I thought you might like...

484
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:49,160
Apples... and bananas.

485
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:51,829
He's a show-off.
He smells 'em a mile away.

486
00:36:51,954 --> 00:36:55,833
- The apples are on the bottom shelf.
- Two o'clock, I know. Thanks.

487
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:58,878
Do you, uh... Do you want some coffee?

488
00:36:59,003 --> 00:37:00,463
OK.

489
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:02,465
Amy, how long are you in town?

490
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,633
Argh!

491
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:06,344
- You OK?
- Yeah! I'm fine.

492
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:07,678
You're bleeding!

493
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:12,141
The first thing with a blind man is -
don't change anything. It's too dangerous.

494
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:13,851
Jennie...

495
00:37:13,976 --> 00:37:16,979
Listen, it's OK...
Goddammit, I said I'm OK!

496
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,941
It's just a chair. It happens to everybody.

497
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:21,651
Really.

498
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:25,738
I've got parent meetings tonight.
Your dinner's in the freezer.

499
00:37:25,863 --> 00:37:27,490
It's in the lower corner.

500
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:30,952
It's nice to have met you, Amy.

501
00:37:31,077 --> 00:37:34,163
- You, too, Jennie.
- Thanks.

502
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:40,002
Well, she's just being an older sister.

503
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:43,756
She's just being jealous.
Do you want some coffee?

504
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:45,925
- Yeah
- OK.

505
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:33,222
Hey!

506
00:38:34,974 --> 00:38:36,309
- Virgil.
- Hi.

507
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:37,268
Hey.

508
00:38:37,393 --> 00:38:41,397
I've been looking all over for you.
I have some great news.

509
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:45,735
- That Atlanta project of yours?
- Oh, no, something much better.

510
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:48,988
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

511
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:51,532
I'm all ears.

512
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:56,662
- Hi.
- Hey.

513
00:38:58,081 --> 00:38:59,957
- Let me catch my breath.
- OK.

514
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,918
All right.

515
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,211
OK.

516
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:07,256
Have you ever wondered
what it would be like to see?

517
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:09,175
Sure.

518
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,638
Like, uh, whether there's, uh,
life on Mars,

519
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:18,184
or whether or not the... aliens
built the pyramids.

520
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:22,063
OK, but if there were a chance,

521
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:27,193
if something could be done
to give you sight, would you take it?

522
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:31,864
Well... What are we talking about here?

523
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:38,246
- Um, I saw that article on Doctor Aaron.
- Who?

524
00:39:38,371 --> 00:39:42,166
He's... He's the leading eye surgeon
on the Eastern seaboard.

525
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:46,087
And I called him up
at Manhattan Eye and Ear.

526
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:48,798
And I spoke to him about you.

527
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:51,300
I'm sorry, you... you called this guy?

528
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:53,594
Yes, and he just faxed me back

529
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,306
and he said that he would be
very excited to see you.

530
00:39:57,432 --> 00:40:01,227
He thinks that in your case
there might be a chance of reversal.

531
00:40:01,352 --> 00:40:03,354
What do you think?

532
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:08,026
I guess I'm, uh...

533
00:40:08,151 --> 00:40:11,654
I forgot that it's
Help the Handicapped Week.

534
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:15,324
I... I thought you'd be excited.
What's the problem?

535
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:19,287
That's the point, Amy.
There is no goddamn problem.

536
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:26,919
- Hi.
- Hi, Jennie.

537
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:29,255
You did great work today.

538
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,674
- See you tomorrow.
- OK, thanks.

539
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:33,926
- Hi.
- Amy, right?

540
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:37,055
Right.
Um, could I speak to you for a minute?

541
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,725
- Yeah. Something wrong?
- There's something I don't understand.

542
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:44,187
I saw that article on Dr Aaron
and I called him.

543
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:46,689
- He's willing to see Virgil.
- Bye, Jennie.

544
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:48,358
In fact, he's anxious to see him.

545
00:40:48,483 --> 00:40:51,319
But when I told Virgil
he acted as if I was trying to...

546
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:54,322
What don't you understand?

547
00:40:54,447 --> 00:40:57,325
Well, if I had spent
nearly all my life blind,

548
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,537
and there was the remotest possibility
that I could regain my sight,

549
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:03,206
I would be all over that.

550
00:41:03,331 --> 00:41:06,167
When there's something
you've adapted to,

551
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:09,504
you'd change it
without knowing the consequences?

552
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:12,548
Oh...

553
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:16,803
We're very happy here, Amy.
Virgil has everything he needs.

554
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:22,475
Wait.

555
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,811
Everything that he needs?

556
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:29,774
Does he need to go through life blind
if there's a possibility that he could see?

557
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:33,277
I would give him my eyes
if it would help him see. But it won't.

558
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:36,280
I learned a long time ago
to stop believing in miracles.

559
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:39,909
- I see where you're coming from.
- Yes, you do. And Virgil doesn't.

560
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,786
Why can't you accept that?

561
00:41:41,911 --> 00:41:44,080
He spent his first eight years

562
00:41:44,497 --> 00:41:48,960
having his eyes probed, pierced,
prodded, poked at by doctors,

563
00:41:49,085 --> 00:41:51,879
faith healers, spiritualists, medicine men.

564
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:56,259
My father lined them up outside the door.
It hurt and disappointed all of us.

565
00:41:56,384 --> 00:41:57,969
And it almost killed him.

566
00:41:58,094 --> 00:42:00,555
He doesn't need to go through that again.

567
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,808
So, now maybe you understand.

568
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:09,856
He gets it out to...

569
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:12,275
No, no, no!

570
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,236
I can't believe you guys
are doing this to me!

571
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:17,155
I can kick better than you guys!

572
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,032
What? Virgil!

573
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:21,617
Amy?

574
00:42:21,743 --> 00:42:22,994
Hey.

575
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:29,667
Hi, Amy. Just a... Ranger game.

576
00:42:32,837 --> 00:42:35,798
- Are they losing?
- Well, no, I'd, uh,

577
00:42:35,923 --> 00:42:39,594
prefer to think of it as not winning.

578
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:42,055
- Hi.
- Hi.

579
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,224
Do you want to, uh, come in?

580
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,852
Get a Coke or, um, beer or something?

581
00:42:47,977 --> 00:42:50,229
No, I'm fine. I just, uh...

582
00:42:50,355 --> 00:42:54,692
I just wanted to come to see you
before I had to go back to the city.

583
00:42:54,817 --> 00:42:57,862
Oh! Spa days are over?

584
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:02,158
- I've got to go back to work.
- Mm-hm.

585
00:43:02,658 --> 00:43:07,372
I wanted to apologise for stomping around
in your life like Big Foot today.

586
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:09,624
It... wasn't my place. I'm sorry.

587
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:12,043
Here. Here.

588
00:43:13,711 --> 00:43:17,965
See, um... See the tree over there?
Across the drive?

589
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:20,676
Yeah.

590
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:25,681
- How far away is it?
- Guessing, about 25ft.

591
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:31,062
Mm, to you maybe.
But to me, it's 14 steps.

592
00:43:31,187 --> 00:43:35,483
14 steps and I get to the tree.
But if I think about something else,

593
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:41,948
if I go too slow, or if I rush,
then l... smash right into it.

594
00:43:47,745 --> 00:43:48,663
OK.

595
00:43:48,788 --> 00:43:54,168
Well, I guess l, you know,
I should go... pack.

596
00:43:55,712 --> 00:44:00,550
Oh, you like smashing into trees?

597
00:44:29,287 --> 00:44:30,288
Amy?

598
00:44:32,123 --> 00:44:34,834
I'm over here.

599
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:39,505
- I couldn't sleep.
- Well, come back in bed.

600
00:45:11,788 --> 00:45:13,956
I want you to hear one thing.

601
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:16,000
What?

602
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:18,836
- That I'm... happy.
- Haven't we been through this enough?

603
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:22,548
- You're not being fair.
- I don't want to see you get hurt.

604
00:45:22,673 --> 00:45:24,258
- That's yourpoint?
- Yes.

605
00:45:24,384 --> 00:45:28,179
- So, what's your advice?
- I'm worried about you, that's all.

606
00:45:28,304 --> 00:45:31,391
- No, that's not the point.
- Yes, it is the point.

607
00:45:31,516 --> 00:45:34,143
- That's what you're saying.
- No, that's...

608
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:36,604
- You're acting like a child.
- You are, too.

609
00:45:49,742 --> 00:45:52,161
- Hi.
- Hi. Is everything all right?

610
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:54,080
Yeah.

611
00:45:54,205 --> 00:45:56,040
No...

612
00:45:56,165 --> 00:45:59,335
I didn't like the feeling last night
of waking up

613
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,672
and... thinking you weren't there.

614
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:07,135
Let's go to New York.

615
00:46:13,933 --> 00:46:18,521
# The way you sip your tea

616
00:46:18,646 --> 00:46:22,400
# The memory of all that...

617
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:28,406
# No, no
They can't take that away from me

618
00:46:30,408 --> 00:46:34,120
Honey, it is
the most beautiful New York day.

619
00:46:34,245 --> 00:46:37,790
Crisp and clear. There are
white, puffy clouds above the city.

620
00:46:37,915 --> 00:46:39,667
Maybe like the ones you saw.

621
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:43,463
No, the ones I saw
I could hold in my hand.

622
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:44,630
Watch out!

623
00:46:45,298 --> 00:46:46,007
Oh!

624
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:54,474
# They can't take that away from me

625
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:58,895
The cataracts act like a curtain
across the window of sight.

626
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,064
And if the disease to the retina

627
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:05,068
is reduced or in check, which is
impossible to know at this point,

628
00:47:05,193 --> 00:47:08,237
but if that is the case,
using this new procedure,

629
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:11,574
there is a good possibility
we can give you sight.

630
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,785
Sounds expensive.

631
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,954
Well, there's an opportunity
for all of us here.

632
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,417
Not often do we get to restore sight
to someone with extended blindness.

633
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:24,587
I'm sure we can get the lnstitute
to pick up the bill.

634
00:47:24,712 --> 00:47:29,509
- I've been through all this before.
- Believe me, I know.

635
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:33,137
But it's nothing as invasive
as what you went through as a child.

636
00:47:33,262 --> 00:47:36,974
I mean, uh, 25 years ago,
cataract surgery was in the Dark Ages.

637
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,143
We've come a long way since then.

638
00:47:39,268 --> 00:47:44,774
And, uh, Dr Goldman here will perform
the surgery. He's one of our best.

639
00:47:44,899 --> 00:47:46,984
What if it doesn't work?

640
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:52,240
Well, then you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

641
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:55,576
I mean, basically,
what have you got to lose?

642
00:47:57,787 --> 00:47:59,956
So, this is my place.

643
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:03,501
There's a great park around the corner.
We're in TriBeCa.

644
00:48:03,626 --> 00:48:04,919
- Ho-ho-ho!
- Sorry.

645
00:48:05,044 --> 00:48:10,174
Ethan, watch out.
Hey. This, my friend, is Virgil.

646
00:48:10,299 --> 00:48:12,593
- Virgil, Ethan.
- Ethan.

647
00:48:13,052 --> 00:48:15,179
- Are you blind?
- Yeah.

648
00:48:15,304 --> 00:48:17,807
- Cool. See ya.
- See ya.

649
00:48:17,932 --> 00:48:20,768
- Kids think I'm cool.
- You are.

650
00:48:21,728 --> 00:48:24,397
OK, here we are.

651
00:48:25,606 --> 00:48:27,692
This is my loft.

652
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:32,655
- Can I put this down here?
- Yeah, anywhere. I'll just get it later.

653
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,868
OK, can I do some blind 101?

654
00:48:36,993 --> 00:48:41,456
You just walk me down the centre
and point out all the obstacles.

655
00:48:41,581 --> 00:48:45,793
If you want to move anything,
once you move it, don't move it again.

656
00:48:45,918 --> 00:48:48,296
Otherwise, crash.

657
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:50,173
OK, got it.

658
00:48:50,298 --> 00:48:53,509
Well, to our right
is the living-room section.

659
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:57,555
There's a couch and some low tables,
and a chair at two o'clock.

660
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:04,604
OK, over here at 10, um, there is a post.
And I've hit this many times, so...

661
00:49:04,729 --> 00:49:07,607
Over to the right is...

662
00:49:07,732 --> 00:49:10,568
Whoa, a little further right, the bed.

663
00:49:10,693 --> 00:49:13,821
In front of it is a low table
you could hurt your shin on.

664
00:49:13,946 --> 00:49:16,991
Uh, three o'clock there is a TV.

665
00:49:17,116 --> 00:49:21,287
And this is, uh, my desk here.

666
00:49:21,412 --> 00:49:23,623
I have a computer.

667
00:49:23,748 --> 00:49:28,127
- And, uh, I've got my model here of...
- What's this?

668
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,798
Mm... It's a... sculpture.

669
00:49:33,216 --> 00:49:35,927
- You did it.
- Yeah.

670
00:49:36,052 --> 00:49:39,389
Art school. It's not very good.

671
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:42,850
It's a mother holding her baby.

672
00:49:42,975 --> 00:49:45,520
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, whatever.

673
00:49:45,645 --> 00:49:48,356
I mean, I can never finish it.

674
00:49:48,481 --> 00:49:51,567
OK, come on.

675
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:54,821
Then we have reached
the end of the room.

676
00:49:54,946 --> 00:49:58,074
- The wall of windows.
- Hm. Do they open?

677
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,200
Yeah.

678
00:50:00,827 --> 00:50:01,953
Oh, shoot. Oh.

679
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:03,079
Sorry.

680
00:50:06,374 --> 00:50:09,168
- Sorry about that.
- It's OK.

681
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:13,631
What are they?

682
00:50:13,756 --> 00:50:16,509
Um, they're my plans.

683
00:50:16,718 --> 00:50:21,014
Designs for jobs I'm working on.
Like the Atlanta mall we're bidding on,

684
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:25,226
or... I don't know,
we have the TriBeCa lobby. It's what I do.

685
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,481
What are the plans? Are they drawings?

686
00:50:30,606 --> 00:50:34,694
Yeah, some of them are drawings.
The one you're touching is a drawing.

687
00:50:34,819 --> 00:50:39,782
Some of them are computer-generated
and blueprints. But I drew this one.

688
00:50:50,418 --> 00:50:53,504
What are you thinking about?

689
00:50:55,923 --> 00:50:58,760
I want to have this operation.

690
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:01,054
You mean it?

691
00:51:05,808 --> 00:51:06,809
Yes.

692
00:51:08,728 --> 00:51:12,648
I-A map. US hydrosolic.

693
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:19,781
US stay go. US pulse. US l-A.

694
00:51:19,906 --> 00:51:22,575
Retina looks good.
All right, balance saw.

695
00:51:24,452 --> 00:51:27,789
And the hydrodissection now, please.

696
00:51:28,498 --> 00:51:31,876
- Cortical cleavage.
- Irrigation system.

697
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:34,629
- First cut.
- I-A map.

698
00:51:36,005 --> 00:51:38,007
Coffee?

699
00:51:38,132 --> 00:51:40,009
Oh, thanks.

700
00:51:40,134 --> 00:51:42,178
It's pretty bad.

701
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:50,228
So, Virgil never talks about his parents.
Do they know?

702
00:51:50,353 --> 00:51:54,565
Well, our mom died when I was 18
and, uh, Virgil was just a teenager.

703
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:58,903
And our, uh, father... Well, he left us

704
00:51:59,028 --> 00:52:00,697
quite a while ago.

705
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:03,408
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

706
00:52:06,786 --> 00:52:08,996
Ugh, you're right, that is bad.

707
00:52:10,915 --> 00:52:14,752
That must have been tough on you,
taking care of him all alone,

708
00:52:14,877 --> 00:52:17,255
after your mom died.

709
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,424
Well, he's my brother.

710
00:52:21,426 --> 00:52:22,301
Ready?

711
00:52:23,136 --> 00:52:26,014
And now the Sinskey hook, please.

712
00:52:26,222 --> 00:52:31,019
- US hydrosolic.
- I can see the optic nerve and the retina.

713
00:52:31,144 --> 00:52:33,187
US pulse.

714
00:52:33,813 --> 00:52:35,023
Patch.

715
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:38,401
That's it. Let's patch him up, Tracy.
Terrific.

716
00:52:45,116 --> 00:52:47,744
- Hello?
- Virgil, we're here.

717
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:51,497
Hi.

718
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,294
- Hi.
- How you doing?

719
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,589
How are you feeling?

720
00:53:00,173 --> 00:53:05,303
Well, a bit like a tequila hangover.
But I can't remember the party.

721
00:53:05,428 --> 00:53:07,764
The doctor said that you did great.

722
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:11,351
- Did it hurt a lot?
- Just the operation.

723
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:17,273
Hey, how's my hair? I'd hate for
my first seeing day to be a bad hair day.

724
00:53:17,398 --> 00:53:19,734
Looks good.

725
00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:22,236
Who are those, um, people?

726
00:53:22,362 --> 00:53:23,946
There's a camera crew.

727
00:53:24,072 --> 00:53:26,991
For posterity.
We're gonna make you famous here.

728
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:31,746
We're sending this closed-circuit into
one of our conference rooms. Is that OK?

729
00:53:31,871 --> 00:53:32,538
Sure.

730
00:53:32,663 --> 00:53:38,044
- OK, you ready to get started?
- Yeah. Let's... see what we see.

731
00:53:38,169 --> 00:53:40,213
All right.

732
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:42,590
You mean right... right now?

733
00:53:42,715 --> 00:53:44,008
OK.

734
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:47,345
- Is that all right?
- Yeah. I'm just... a little nervous.

735
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:48,638
OK?

736
00:53:48,763 --> 00:53:52,725
All right, let's start taking the first one off.

737
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,353
This is just the outside.

738
00:54:03,236 --> 00:54:04,987
OK, phase one.

739
00:54:07,198 --> 00:54:10,952
Take off the, uh, right patch.

740
00:54:17,417 --> 00:54:19,252
And the left.

741
00:54:20,628 --> 00:54:21,629
OK.

742
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,924
And there we go.

743
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,093
OK.

744
00:54:34,475 --> 00:54:36,561
So, what do you see?

745
00:54:39,856 --> 00:54:41,482
Oh, my God...

746
00:54:50,116 --> 00:54:52,160
Well, what do you see?

747
00:54:52,785 --> 00:54:54,370
I don't know.

748
00:54:54,495 --> 00:54:56,539
Can you see Amy?

749
00:54:57,415 --> 00:54:59,459
I'm over here, Virgil.

750
00:55:02,712 --> 00:55:04,172
I don't know.

751
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:10,845
- Can you see your sister?
- Virgil, are you OK? Are you OK?

752
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:13,890
Oh, God! This isn't right.
Something's wrong.

753
00:55:14,015 --> 00:55:15,808
- What's wrong?
- There's a problem.

754
00:55:15,933 --> 00:55:19,062
- It'll be fine.
- It's not fine. Don't say it's fine!

755
00:55:19,187 --> 00:55:21,814
- This can't be seeing.
- What do you see?

756
00:55:22,565 --> 00:55:24,692
Argh! Oh, that's bad!

757
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,655
Oh, my God!

758
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:31,699
- Stop moving!
- Get the lights out!

759
00:55:31,866 --> 00:55:34,369
- Get them out of here!
- What can we do?

760
00:55:35,953 --> 00:55:38,998
OK, Virgil, they've gone. Let's calm down.

761
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:42,752
- OK, all right.
- It's all right, it's OK, they've left.

762
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:46,339
I gotta think. Something's wrong.
This can't be seeing.

763
00:55:46,464 --> 00:55:48,257
- Come on.
- It's OK, just relax.

764
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:50,343
OK, I need to think.

765
00:55:50,468 --> 00:55:52,303
What can we do?

766
00:55:52,428 --> 00:55:54,722
Um, give me something in my hands.

767
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,432
OK.

768
00:55:57,934 --> 00:55:58,726
OK.

769
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:04,315
OK. OK.

770
00:56:04,482 --> 00:56:08,486
Good.
Now, just use your sense of touch.

771
00:56:08,611 --> 00:56:11,447
Just associate now.
What do you see in front of you?

772
00:56:11,572 --> 00:56:12,782
Oh...

773
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,743
Use your touch.

774
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:18,162
I'm right here, Virgil.

775
00:56:38,641 --> 00:56:40,309
- It's a can.
- Good, good.

776
00:56:40,435 --> 00:56:44,981
- What's going on?
- Associating. His fingers tell his brain,

777
00:56:45,106 --> 00:56:49,235
then his brain tells his eyes.
Then he recognises what's in front of him.

778
00:56:52,363 --> 00:56:57,118
OK, Virgil, let's, uh,
give your eyes a rest. OK?

779
00:56:57,243 --> 00:57:01,164
We should all be very happy.
We've got something.

780
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:11,257
With extended blindness...

781
00:57:11,382 --> 00:57:14,177
- Dr, may I speak to you for a moment?
- Sure.

782
00:57:14,302 --> 00:57:18,348
What the hell just happened in there?
ls that what you call seeing?

783
00:57:18,473 --> 00:57:22,894
It's a little complicated.
It is clear that he is seeing.

784
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:26,731
He's picking up images.
Apparently his retina is intact.

785
00:57:27,398 --> 00:57:30,902
For all intents and purposes,
it's a success.

786
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:34,447
A success? He's lost.
He can't see me, or his sister.

787
00:57:34,572 --> 00:57:36,616
He can only see a Coke can.

788
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:39,869
And that's only after he held it.
He could do that before.

789
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:44,374
Believe me, he can see you.
He just doesn't understand what he sees.

790
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:50,671
- So, is this temporary? Will this go away?
- Well, there is a visual therapist.

791
00:57:50,797 --> 00:57:53,674
It's a fella named Phil Webster.

792
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,136
He's unorthodox,
but he's probably our best bet,

793
00:57:57,261 --> 00:58:00,181
considering the unique aspects
of this case.

794
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:03,559
I'll contact him right away.
But there's no guarantees.

795
00:58:03,685 --> 00:58:06,562
- He might be able to help us.
- No guarantee?

796
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:09,232
Look, we are all on new ground here.

797
00:58:09,816 --> 00:58:11,818
Let's try to be optimistic.

798
00:58:11,943 --> 00:58:13,695
I mean, he can see.

799
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:29,001
Oh...

800
00:58:30,962 --> 00:58:33,172
Uh... Hello?

801
00:58:36,008 --> 00:58:38,052
Oh...

802
00:58:47,145 --> 00:58:49,022
Oh...

803
00:58:57,905 --> 00:58:59,949
Mm.

804
00:59:00,742 --> 00:59:02,410
Hello?

805
01:00:20,655 --> 01:00:21,572
Amy?

806
01:00:23,825 --> 01:00:25,868
No, it's Jen.

807
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:28,287
Huh...

808
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:35,378
S...

809
01:00:36,754 --> 01:00:38,798
So this is you.

810
01:00:40,633 --> 01:00:42,677
This is me.

811
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:52,145
Everything's gonna be all right,
soon as we can get you home.

812
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:55,481
I'm not gonna go home.
I'm gonna stay in New York,

813
01:00:55,606 --> 01:00:59,777
where the doctors are
and where they can take care of me.

814
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:04,115
I can't stay here,
and... you can't go through this alone.

815
01:01:04,615 --> 01:01:06,868
Who's gonna take care of...

816
01:01:10,121 --> 01:01:12,165
Amy?

817
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:16,461
She's gonna look after you?

818
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:20,465
She knows nothing about the blind.

819
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:23,259
But I'm not blind any more, Jennie.

820
01:01:23,384 --> 01:01:25,595
OK.

821
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,722
- Two weeks.
- No.

822
01:01:27,847 --> 01:01:29,515
Not one day.

823
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,852
I'm not...
I'm not gonna do anything to lose her.

824
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:40,401
OK.

825
01:01:46,866 --> 01:01:49,160
Hey.

826
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:53,414
- Hey.
- Virgil's finishing getting ready.

827
01:01:53,539 --> 01:01:55,708
Would you mind walking me to my car?

828
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:59,921
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm scared to death.

829
01:02:01,672 --> 01:02:05,301
I've spent my whole life
looking for holes he might fall in.

830
01:02:06,135 --> 01:02:08,971
I'd run up ahead and cover 'em up.

831
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:12,558
Everywhere I look here, I see holes.

832
01:02:13,768 --> 01:02:17,397
Well, hopefully
he'll start seeing them for himself.

833
01:02:17,522 --> 01:02:22,151
Believe me, Jennie, I don't want him
to get hurt any more than you do.

834
01:02:22,443 --> 01:02:25,822
What hurt Virgil the most
was his father leaving.

835
01:02:26,531 --> 01:02:29,450
He thought it had to do with his blindness.

836
01:02:29,575 --> 01:02:33,788
That he hadn't tried hard enough.
Or he could have been better.

837
01:02:35,456 --> 01:02:37,709
I'm not going anywhere, Jennie.

838
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:40,545
A blind child can't see
those close to them.

839
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:45,675
They never learn how to reach out.
If he's unhappy, or in pain, or confused,

840
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,468
Virgil won't reach out.

841
01:02:47,593 --> 01:02:50,930
He goes behind a wall,
a place we can't go to.

842
01:02:51,889 --> 01:02:56,227
He just needs to have somebody
be there for him when he comes back.

843
01:02:58,187 --> 01:03:00,189
OK.

844
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:13,327
OK.

845
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:17,373
Well, this is it, this is home.

846
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:20,084
Oh, God.

847
01:03:20,209 --> 01:03:22,295
Whoa. You OK?

848
01:03:22,795 --> 01:03:24,839
Stop the world, I wanna get off.

849
01:03:24,964 --> 01:03:26,924
- We'll go slow...
- What's that?

850
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:31,971
Wh... Oh, it's a shadow, sweetie.
It's nothing. You can walk through it. See?

851
01:03:35,224 --> 01:03:37,435
- Hey, Virgil, it's Ethan.
- Hey.

852
01:03:37,852 --> 01:03:40,104
Are you all right? You look kinda funny.

853
01:03:40,229 --> 01:03:43,358
You should see
what you look like from here.

854
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:47,862
- OK. We're gonna go upstairs now.
- All right. Hey, Zach!

855
01:03:47,987 --> 01:03:50,031
God, I feel like such a child.

856
01:03:50,156 --> 01:03:55,661
It's OK. We're gonna find
that Webster guy and get his help, OK?

857
01:03:59,665 --> 01:04:01,709
Here we go.

858
01:04:02,335 --> 01:04:05,088
- Keep your eyes closed for one second.
- OK.

859
01:04:10,009 --> 01:04:11,177
OK.

860
01:04:11,302 --> 01:04:13,137
Oh...

861
01:04:13,262 --> 01:04:14,972
Oh, no, I'm sorry, sweetie.

862
01:04:15,139 --> 01:04:17,642
- No, I wanna see it.
- It's too much.

863
01:04:19,686 --> 01:04:23,147
- Does this look like this all the time?
- No. Oh, God!

864
01:04:23,272 --> 01:04:27,193
While we were at the hospital,
I asked Betsy to come over here.

865
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:29,987
I wanted to make it special. I'm sorry.

866
01:04:30,279 --> 01:04:33,491
Oh. Maybe I'd better sit down.
I'm kinda dizzy.

867
01:04:34,117 --> 01:04:35,118
OK.

868
01:04:38,788 --> 01:04:41,541
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's great.

869
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:44,836
Let me just look at you though.

870
01:04:46,003 --> 01:04:48,047
Can you see me?

871
01:04:48,172 --> 01:04:49,173
Yes.

872
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,387
Can I see all of you?

873
01:04:54,512 --> 01:04:57,557
All of me? Like all of me?

874
01:04:57,682 --> 01:05:00,768
Oh, God! lf you want to.

875
01:05:01,144 --> 01:05:05,189
I'm so nervous. I can't believe this.
What if you don't like what you see?

876
01:05:05,314 --> 01:05:07,358
That's impossible.

877
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:11,320
I'll close my eyes.

878
01:05:12,196 --> 01:05:16,159
No. No, no. This is your first seeing day.
You have to see everything.

879
01:06:04,123 --> 01:06:06,626
So, this is what beautiful looks like.

880
01:06:33,111 --> 01:06:38,366
Right. OK. Virgil, it says here
you went blind as a child,

881
01:06:38,491 --> 01:06:41,494
before you developed
a visual vocabulary.

882
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:44,330
You have a problem with depth offield,

883
01:06:44,455 --> 01:06:46,791
space, shape, size and distance.

884
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:52,213
It's fascinating. There's only been
20 cases of this in the last 200 years.

885
01:06:52,338 --> 01:06:57,510
Your eyes work, but your brain
hasn't learned to process the information.

886
01:06:57,635 --> 01:07:01,973
You are mentally blind.
Neurologists call this visual agnosia.

887
01:07:02,098 --> 01:07:04,434
Well, I call it pretty screwed up.

888
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,730
That's a much better term.
I'll bring it up at the next meeting.

889
01:07:08,855 --> 01:07:13,234
It would be difficult to get grant money
for the pretty-screwed-up foundation.

890
01:07:14,444 --> 01:07:17,363
I have something I'd like to read to you.

891
01:07:17,488 --> 01:07:21,075
Oh. Rugalach? I made it myself.

892
01:07:22,368 --> 01:07:23,536
Dammit.

893
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:26,039
Uh, my glasses, I can never find 'em.

894
01:07:26,164 --> 01:07:28,791
Mrs Fenster! Help!

895
01:07:32,336 --> 01:07:34,881
Thank you. Happens all the time.

896
01:07:35,006 --> 01:07:37,759
OK, Alberto Valvo.

897
01:07:37,884 --> 01:07:41,971
Uh... "Sight Restoration
after Long-term Blindness."

898
01:07:42,096 --> 01:07:43,389
Ah...

899
01:07:43,514 --> 01:07:47,477
"One must die as a blind person
to be born again

900
01:07:47,602 --> 01:07:49,854
as a sighted person."

901
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:53,733
"However, it is the interim,
the limbo between two worlds,

902
01:07:53,858 --> 01:07:55,318
that is so terrible."

903
01:07:57,570 --> 01:08:00,531
There you go, pal. You're in limbo.

904
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:05,536
That... That's it? Limbo? I mean...
That book doesn't have anything else

905
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:11,125
- that might help with Virgil's condition?
- Limbo's not so bad. It's like New Jersey.

906
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:15,129
You can see where all the good stuff is.
You just have to get there.

907
01:08:15,254 --> 01:08:19,175
I know, I know,
you were expecting Anne Bancroft.

908
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,011
A dramatic breakthrough
out by the water pump.

909
01:08:22,136 --> 01:08:24,180
Sorry, I'm just a professor.

910
01:08:24,305 --> 01:08:27,809
I teach people how to teach the blind
how to become independent.

911
01:08:27,934 --> 01:08:32,313
Unfortunately, there's no manual
on what you're going through.

912
01:08:32,438 --> 01:08:37,527
I'd like to help, but like the rest of things
in life, it's really up to you.

913
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:42,073
Are you crazy? I'm completely confused.

914
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:45,868
You said you'd like to help,
so we came here for help...

915
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:50,623
- All right, all right, you want a lesson?
- Yes!

916
01:08:50,748 --> 01:08:53,710
Here we go. Lesson number one.

917
01:08:54,502 --> 01:08:56,546
Repeat after me...

918
01:08:56,671 --> 01:08:59,507
The rain in Spain stays mainly...

919
01:08:59,632 --> 01:09:02,427
Look, I'm kidding! It's a joke.

920
01:09:04,178 --> 01:09:06,180
What's this?

921
01:09:10,268 --> 01:09:12,770
It's an... It's an apple.

922
01:09:12,895 --> 01:09:16,357
Good, good.
You've now won the toaster oven.

923
01:09:16,774 --> 01:09:18,484
OK.

924
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:23,823
What's this?

925
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:26,451
It's an apple.

926
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:31,205
Good, but is it an apple
or just a picture of an apple?

927
01:09:36,711 --> 01:09:40,548
OK. So, uh, this is a joke, right?

928
01:09:40,673 --> 01:09:45,636
What are you saying?
That our... my eyes lie?

929
01:09:45,762 --> 01:09:48,848
Your eyesight can
and will play tricks on you.

930
01:09:48,973 --> 01:09:53,936
No matter what I could teach you,
they'll still play tricks on you.

931
01:09:54,062 --> 01:09:57,774
- You've gotta trust your instincts.
- I don't have any.

932
01:09:57,899 --> 01:10:00,943
My instinct is to close my eyes
and feel my way out of here.

933
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:05,323
That's a self-preservation instinct.
But you have others.

934
01:10:05,448 --> 01:10:10,411
Virgil, you have to learn to see,
just like you learned to speak.

935
01:10:10,536 --> 01:10:13,623
Perception, sight, life

936
01:10:13,748 --> 01:10:18,961
is about experience, reaching out
and exploring the world for yourself.

937
01:10:19,087 --> 01:10:22,799
It's not enough to just see.
We've got to look as well.

938
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:26,678
Immediately following the operation

939
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:30,848
the patient experienced
extreme disorientation.

940
01:10:31,057 --> 01:10:33,559
Images and colours
had no meaning for him.

941
01:10:33,685 --> 01:10:35,770
But now,

942
01:10:35,895 --> 01:10:37,939
just weeks after surgery,

943
01:10:38,064 --> 01:10:44,112
Mr Adamson has mastered the ability
to define shape and distance,

944
01:10:44,237 --> 01:10:48,032
giving him confidence
to move about his environment.

945
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:51,411
He is still

946
01:10:51,536 --> 01:10:55,540
confused by new images
just as a child would be fascinated by

947
01:10:55,665 --> 01:10:58,167
everyday objects
that we take for granted.

948
01:10:58,793 --> 01:11:00,128
Look up.

949
01:11:01,462 --> 01:11:02,714
What is it?

950
01:11:02,839 --> 01:11:05,925
It's art. Dubuffet.

951
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:09,303
This is art?

952
01:11:09,429 --> 01:11:14,142
Oh, now that has to be art! Look at that.
That is beautiful.

953
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:17,729
Uh, no,
that's just somebody being destructive.

954
01:11:18,187 --> 01:11:21,107
- The words read something pretty nasty.
- What is it?

955
01:11:21,232 --> 01:11:23,276
It says pigshit.

956
01:11:24,694 --> 01:11:28,197
His progress is steady
but Virgil still relies on his touch

957
01:11:28,322 --> 01:11:32,285
- to interpret objects in his surroundings.
- It's a dog!

958
01:11:34,954 --> 01:11:36,581
I'm sorry, yes.

959
01:11:37,165 --> 01:11:40,209
His understanding
of three-dimensionality

960
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:42,670
is very limited and confounding to him.

961
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,715
Wow, listen to the bells.

962
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,884
What's that? That lump?

963
01:11:49,886 --> 01:11:52,513
Oh, that's... that's a homeless person.

964
01:11:52,638 --> 01:11:54,766
You just walked right past him.

965
01:11:55,224 --> 01:11:57,143
You didn't even look.

966
01:11:57,268 --> 01:12:02,565
Well, some things you choose not to see.
You can't look at everything, Virgil.

967
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:05,526
I don't want to look away.
I want to see everything.

968
01:12:05,651 --> 01:12:08,654
What the hell are you looking at?
Get outta here!

969
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:13,451
He also has difficulty with scanning.
That's putting the whole picture together.

970
01:12:18,873 --> 01:12:23,294
I've got 10 years' experience
at Bear Mountain, in all kinds, really.

971
01:12:23,419 --> 01:12:26,589
Deep-tissue, therapeutic, shiatsu.

972
01:12:26,714 --> 01:12:29,175
That's fine. Let's get you started.

973
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:33,888
Here's your l-9, W-4,
basic employment package. Fill these out.

974
01:12:34,013 --> 01:12:35,848
Take 'em over to Connie.

975
01:12:40,269 --> 01:12:43,481
Oh, gosh, you know what?
I forgot my glasses.

976
01:12:43,606 --> 01:12:45,358
I'll take this home,

977
01:12:45,483 --> 01:12:48,611
- and fill it out, and bring it back, OK?
- All right.

978
01:12:48,736 --> 01:12:52,782
This includes his ability to read,
meaning he has

979
01:12:52,907 --> 01:12:54,951
a total lack ofvisual memory.

980
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:04,877
Sweetie, it might help if you kind of...
take the word...

981
01:13:05,002 --> 01:13:08,172
No, it won't help, Amy.
I told you, it's not helping.

982
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:11,759
I know what I'm supposed to do.
I just can't do it, OK?

983
01:13:11,884 --> 01:13:15,596
I can't read. When I reach the last letter
I can't remember the first.

984
01:13:15,722 --> 01:13:19,017
I can't fill out an application.
Somebody has to do it for me

985
01:13:19,142 --> 01:13:22,020
Iike I'm blind, but I'm not blind.

986
01:13:22,311 --> 01:13:24,689
Your helping isn't helping.

987
01:13:26,983 --> 01:13:29,027
OK, I'm sorry.

988
01:13:29,736 --> 01:13:32,655
This is an unexpected
physiological flaw,

989
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:37,452
and one that we hope that, uh,
Virgil will be able to overcome.

990
01:13:39,245 --> 01:13:41,998
Well, that's it for today. Thank you.

991
01:13:45,585 --> 01:13:49,297
Mr Adamson, Christie Evans from NYN.
Could you give us an idea

992
01:13:49,422 --> 01:13:51,632
- of what you're going through?
- That hurts.

993
01:13:51,758 --> 01:13:55,887
- Do you need to have that light on?
- Yeah. In terms ofyour operation,

994
01:13:56,012 --> 01:13:58,723
were the results met
with your expectations?

995
01:13:58,848 --> 01:14:01,726
Um, I didn't have any expectations.

996
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:06,939
Information? ln Pinecrest, New York,
for a Jennie Adamson.

997
01:14:09,025 --> 01:14:11,736
Um, here, maybe try this.

998
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:13,321
What's that?

999
01:14:13,446 --> 01:14:15,490
You tell me.

1000
01:14:16,616 --> 01:14:18,534
I don't know, it's a crocodile.

1001
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:22,789
- Come on, concentrate.
- I don't want to concentrate, Amy.

1002
01:14:22,914 --> 01:14:26,000
Can't we just have one meal
where it's not about my eyes?

1003
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:28,169
I just want to sit here and eat.

1004
01:14:28,836 --> 01:14:30,463
Just trying to be helpful.

1005
01:14:30,588 --> 01:14:32,715
Let's talk about something else.

1006
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,594
How was your day? What happened?

1007
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,429
Fine. Nothing.

1008
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:44,102
Yeah... No, we were invited to a party
tomorrow night. Duncan's birthday.

1009
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,980
Is that it?

1010
01:14:49,357 --> 01:14:51,401
What do you mean is that it?

1011
01:14:51,567 --> 01:14:55,488
I'm telling you something
I thought you'd have a response to.

1012
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:57,949
Sorry, is that not enough?

1013
01:14:59,492 --> 01:15:02,537
OK. I'll go. Uh...

1014
01:15:03,121 --> 01:15:05,998
Why haven't you finished your sculpture?

1015
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:09,419
Where did that come from?

1016
01:15:09,544 --> 01:15:11,879
I wanna know. I'm there every day and

1017
01:15:12,005 --> 01:15:14,966
I, um, think it's perfect, it's beautiful.

1018
01:15:15,091 --> 01:15:17,927
You said you didn't like it
and it wasn't finished.

1019
01:15:18,052 --> 01:15:22,056
You said it like you never would.
So, that's why I'm asking.

1020
01:15:22,807 --> 01:15:26,185
It's something I care a lot about,
and I can't get right.

1021
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:31,524
I see it in my head and I can't do it right.
It's beautiful and I'm failing it.

1022
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:34,777
So, maybe I'm not an artist.

1023
01:15:40,491 --> 01:15:41,993
What's that?

1024
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,873
It's a lobster.

1025
01:15:47,206 --> 01:15:49,333
People eat this?

1026
01:15:52,128 --> 01:15:55,882
- OK, a measuring cup?
- Try again.

1027
01:15:56,007 --> 01:15:59,135
Hey, you cheated!
You told me you couldn't touch.

1028
01:15:59,344 --> 01:16:01,679
Sometimes you have to touch.

1029
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,266
- A cheese grater?
- Yeah.

1030
01:16:07,852 --> 01:16:09,270
Hello?

1031
01:16:10,355 --> 01:16:13,608
- It's me.
- Jennie! Hi!

1032
01:16:14,484 --> 01:16:16,694
What are you doing here?

1033
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:19,906
You're being so mysterious.
Just tell me why we're here.

1034
01:16:20,031 --> 01:16:22,533
- Well, um...
- What?

1035
01:16:22,658 --> 01:16:25,536
- Our father's here.
- What?!

1036
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:29,207
I recognised his voice
the minute I answered the phone.

1037
01:16:29,332 --> 01:16:31,334
Wha... Which one is he?

1038
01:16:32,418 --> 01:16:35,755
There he is. He's the one
with the clipboard, the phone.

1039
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,675
- I... Oh, no, no, I can't see him.
- Yes, you can.

1040
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,261
- Jennie!
- Virgil, he's our father.

1041
01:16:42,387 --> 01:16:44,972
He heard about the operation
and asked to see you.

1042
01:16:45,098 --> 01:16:47,558
I'm not ready. No, no, Jennie.

1043
01:17:15,461 --> 01:17:17,505
Virgil?

1044
01:17:27,598 --> 01:17:29,642
- Hi.
- Hi.

1045
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:34,397
Were you asleep?

1046
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:36,733
No, I just...

1047
01:17:37,734 --> 01:17:40,194
..forget about the lights sometimes.

1048
01:18:09,891 --> 01:18:13,269
You know,
I've been thinking about that party and

1049
01:18:13,603 --> 01:18:17,315
we don't have to go if you don't want to.
It's no big deal.

1050
01:18:17,774 --> 01:18:22,820
It's your partner's birthday party.
You want me to meet your friends?

1051
01:18:25,782 --> 01:18:26,783
Yeah.

1052
01:18:40,254 --> 01:18:42,215
Glass of red or white?

1053
01:18:44,801 --> 01:18:47,720
- Which one's red?
- That's red, that's white.

1054
01:18:50,765 --> 01:18:52,892
That's the white. You want white?

1055
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,657
Quiet. Shh! He's coming!

1056
01:19:07,782 --> 01:19:10,368
Kill the lights.

1057
01:19:10,493 --> 01:19:14,122
- What's happening?
- It's for the surprise.

1058
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:21,129
- What?
- Nothing. You just had a hair out of place.

1059
01:19:23,715 --> 01:19:25,842
What is this? What... You didn't?

1060
01:19:26,259 --> 01:19:28,886
Surprise!

1061
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:34,392
Is he all right?

1062
01:19:34,517 --> 01:19:37,854
Yeah. He's just kidding around.
He always plays jokes.

1063
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:40,690
Save me some cake!

1064
01:19:47,613 --> 01:19:50,074
Hey, you. How's it all going?

1065
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:54,829
OK. He's progressing slowly,
but he's doing the best he can.

1066
01:19:54,954 --> 01:19:59,042
Actually I was asking about
the mall designs, but, uh, that's OK.

1067
01:19:59,167 --> 01:20:02,503
It's understandable.
So, how is it going?

1068
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:05,590
It's not quite what you expected, is it?

1069
01:20:05,715 --> 01:20:08,092
What do you mean?

1070
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:11,220
You like this guy,
you want to help him out.

1071
01:20:11,346 --> 01:20:14,307
Sometimes good intentions
aren't enough.

1072
01:20:14,432 --> 01:20:16,726
Look at me, I'm still a jerk.

1073
01:20:17,352 --> 01:20:19,270
Yeah. You are.

1074
01:20:20,938 --> 01:20:23,399
Well, happy birthday, jerk.

1075
01:20:31,366 --> 01:20:33,576
Aah. So, uh...

1076
01:20:33,701 --> 01:20:36,788
We are expected in Atlanta tomorrow
with the plans.

1077
01:20:36,913 --> 01:20:40,124
Duncan, I can't go.
There's just too much going on.

1078
01:20:41,376 --> 01:20:42,377
Hey.

1079
01:20:43,378 --> 01:20:46,756
Virgil, I wanted you to meet Duncan.
Duncan, Virgil.

1080
01:20:46,881 --> 01:20:50,134
How's it going? Congratulations.
It's good to see you.

1081
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:54,055
- It's good to see anything.
- Come on, Duncan, let's dance.

1082
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:56,224
Duty calls.

1083
01:20:56,349 --> 01:20:59,143
Amy, sorry about Atlanta.
Could have used you.

1084
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,900
Wha... What was that? Atlanta?

1085
01:21:06,025 --> 01:21:10,446
Oh, he tried to spring a meeting on me.
I told him I wouldn't go.

1086
01:21:10,571 --> 01:21:12,615
Did you change your hair?

1087
01:21:13,157 --> 01:21:15,201
I just combed it.

1088
01:21:23,042 --> 01:21:26,754
Do you think what Webster says is true,
that the eyes lie to us?

1089
01:21:29,298 --> 01:21:31,467
- No, I don't.
- So, what does...

1090
01:21:31,592 --> 01:21:34,512
What does you kissing Duncan say?

1091
01:21:35,138 --> 01:21:38,182
- Oh, God...
- You kissed him. What does that say?

1092
01:21:38,307 --> 01:21:43,354
- It says it's his birthday.
- I haven't seen a kiss like that before.

1093
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:47,525
Well, that's what
a birthday kiss looks like.

1094
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:49,485
What's this look mean?

1095
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:51,279
What look?

1096
01:21:51,404 --> 01:21:54,699
This look. It's strange.
I don't understand what it means.

1097
01:21:54,824 --> 01:21:57,076
- Nothing.
- What does it mean?

1098
01:21:57,201 --> 01:22:00,413
It doesn't mean anything.
We're just talking.

1099
01:22:00,538 --> 01:22:03,666
I'm just looking back at you.
It doesn't mean anything.

1100
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:05,710
Let's dance.

1101
01:22:24,812 --> 01:22:28,191
Don't you want to dance some more?
Try this. It's fun.

1102
01:22:31,652 --> 01:22:32,820
They just do letters.

1103
01:22:35,615 --> 01:22:37,658
You wanna try? Just...

1104
01:22:38,701 --> 01:22:40,912
- You just...
- I don't belong here.

1105
01:22:43,456 --> 01:22:46,292
It's just a stupid dance. Virgil!

1106
01:22:46,417 --> 01:22:49,337
- Hey, look.
- No, fuck looking!

1107
01:22:51,631 --> 01:22:53,675
Oh, my God.

1108
01:22:53,841 --> 01:22:55,885
- Take me home.
- Are you OK?

1109
01:22:59,263 --> 01:23:02,183
- Honey, are you all right?
- Just take me home.

1110
01:23:28,626 --> 01:23:31,379
God, you never stop, do you?

1111
01:23:32,755 --> 01:23:35,717
Well, I've got to get it right.

1112
01:23:36,426 --> 01:23:39,762
Besides, my plane leaves
first thing in the morning.

1113
01:23:39,887 --> 01:23:41,931
Plane?

1114
01:23:42,765 --> 01:23:44,809
I didn't think you were going.

1115
01:23:46,227 --> 01:23:48,271
I'll only be gone a day or two.

1116
01:23:51,524 --> 01:23:53,776
It's, uh, giving you problems, huh?

1117
01:23:53,901 --> 01:23:55,486
What?

1118
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:58,573
This or us?

1119
01:23:59,615 --> 01:24:01,034
Us.

1120
01:24:02,994 --> 01:24:06,622
Amy, I wake up every morning and I

1121
01:24:06,748 --> 01:24:09,083
stare and stare.

1122
01:24:12,628 --> 01:24:15,923
And I'm looking at a total stranger.

1123
01:24:16,049 --> 01:24:18,092
You don't see me?

1124
01:24:18,551 --> 01:24:20,803
I was talking about me.

1125
01:24:23,097 --> 01:24:25,141
You, I feel like

1126
01:24:27,352 --> 01:24:29,937
I saw you better when I was blind.

1127
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:34,442
Well, you're not blind any more.
I'm sorry if that disappoints you.

1128
01:24:36,569 --> 01:24:40,031
Look, I'm done here.
It's late and I gotta get up early.

1129
01:24:41,157 --> 01:24:46,037
I'm gonna go to bed before
we both say things that we don't mean.

1130
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,274
Come on, Katie, your mom's waiting.

1131
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:20,571
- Hi.
- There you go.

1132
01:25:20,697 --> 01:25:24,409
Hey, Virgil!
So you came crawling back, huh?

1133
01:25:24,534 --> 01:25:25,535
Bye.

1134
01:25:27,704 --> 01:25:30,081
You wanna join us? I could use your help.

1135
01:25:30,206 --> 01:25:33,042
- Oh, no, I'll wait here till you're done.
- OK.

1136
01:25:33,459 --> 01:25:35,670
Casey, come on, let's call it a day.

1137
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:43,928
- How is it, working with the kids?
- Great. They're the best.

1138
01:25:44,053 --> 01:25:46,305
And they're the easiest because

1139
01:25:46,431 --> 01:25:49,308
they're so eager
to make their way in the world.

1140
01:25:49,434 --> 01:25:53,062
It's the adults who get stubborn.
Where did you go to blind school?

1141
01:25:53,187 --> 01:25:55,231
I didn't. My father, uh,...

1142
01:25:56,190 --> 01:26:00,361
I was just in regular school.
I picked it up... on my own.

1143
01:26:00,486 --> 01:26:02,530
Oh... Great.

1144
01:26:09,954 --> 01:26:10,955
Apple.

1145
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,583
We've gotta move on to vegetables.

1146
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:17,962
Come on, I got a place for you.
Should relax those eyes a bit.

1147
01:26:20,173 --> 01:26:22,300
Seeing sucks.

1148
01:26:22,425 --> 01:26:24,552
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.
- It sucks.

1149
01:26:24,677 --> 01:26:27,680
You can say that,
sitting in these prime viewing seats?

1150
01:26:27,805 --> 01:26:29,891
Forget your eyes.
Get your head examined.

1151
01:26:30,016 --> 01:26:32,060
I'm serious.

1152
01:26:32,352 --> 01:26:34,979
When I was blind, I couldn't see.
Don't laugh.

1153
01:26:35,104 --> 01:26:40,026
I mean, people don't have expectations.
They know what you are.

1154
01:26:40,151 --> 01:26:41,652
Or they think they know.

1155
01:26:41,778 --> 01:26:44,155
They get on with it. They deal with it.

1156
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,116
Yeah.
Didn't get what you counted on, did you?

1157
01:26:47,533 --> 01:26:50,620
Oh, boy. And now,
here's where it gets complicated.

1158
01:26:50,745 --> 01:26:53,414
Now I can see,
but I don't know what I can see.

1159
01:26:53,539 --> 01:26:56,084
Because your eyes play tricks on you,

1160
01:26:56,209 --> 01:26:59,253
you see things that you don't wanna see.

1161
01:27:00,296 --> 01:27:02,340
Jealousy.

1162
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:06,302
What's most important to you right now?
Seeing, or um...

1163
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:08,137
Amy.

1164
01:27:08,262 --> 01:27:11,557
That's what I thought.
So we're not talking eyes here,

1165
01:27:11,683 --> 01:27:13,726
we're talking the heart.

1166
01:27:14,143 --> 01:27:16,270
The other night I was watching TV.

1167
01:27:16,979 --> 01:27:20,566
One of the major disadvantages
of regaining sight, by the way.

1168
01:27:20,692 --> 01:27:22,944
- There was this famous pianist.
- A what?

1169
01:27:23,069 --> 01:27:27,198
Piano player. And he's about
six, seven hundred years old.

1170
01:27:27,323 --> 01:27:29,617
- Will this be a long story?
- Could be.

1171
01:27:29,742 --> 01:27:32,537
And they bring out
this seven-year-old prodigy.

1172
01:27:32,662 --> 01:27:35,540
He plays Chopin,
backwards and forwards,

1173
01:27:35,665 --> 01:27:39,961
with one arm tied behind his back,
spinning plates. Brilliant.

1174
01:27:40,086 --> 01:27:44,882
The old master listened appreciatively
and at the end he said,

1175
01:27:45,008 --> 01:27:48,094
"You played the piano very well."

1176
01:27:48,219 --> 01:27:52,098
"Maybe one day
you will learn to make music."

1177
01:27:53,516 --> 01:27:56,352
I think I know what you're saying.

1178
01:27:56,477 --> 01:27:59,397
I don't know
if I'll ever be able to make music.

1179
01:27:59,981 --> 01:28:01,816
You just gotta focus.

1180
01:28:01,941 --> 01:28:03,985
Here. See my hand?

1181
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,447
- Yeah.
- All right. Now focus on it.

1182
01:28:07,905 --> 01:28:11,701
Forget about everything else,
and that will be difficult here,

1183
01:28:11,826 --> 01:28:13,870
but just look.

1184
01:28:17,665 --> 01:28:21,627
And your point is?
OK, so, that's what? Seeing?

1185
01:28:21,753 --> 01:28:24,339
No, Grasshopper, that's looking.

1186
01:28:24,464 --> 01:28:26,382
Looking! You watch the fist.

1187
01:28:26,507 --> 01:28:28,593
You see it'll hit you,
but did you want it to?

1188
01:28:28,718 --> 01:28:30,887
- No.
- No. That's looking.

1189
01:28:31,012 --> 01:28:33,514
Virgil, my advice after three beers,

1190
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:38,603
you'll see a lot, but none of that matters
if you lose sight of what you want.

1191
01:28:41,606 --> 01:28:43,649
I love it.

1192
01:28:46,361 --> 01:28:49,739
But... I don't care for the trees.

1193
01:28:53,659 --> 01:28:56,329
I think we should lose them.

1194
01:29:12,762 --> 01:29:15,598
The man just doesn't care for trees.
I dunno.

1195
01:29:15,765 --> 01:29:20,144
How can the man not care for trees?
They were the best part of the location.

1196
01:29:20,812 --> 01:29:22,730
We'll just have to change them.

1197
01:29:22,855 --> 01:29:26,234
No harm there.
You'll come up with something better.

1198
01:29:27,235 --> 01:29:30,697
Hey, um, let me buy you a drink, huh?

1199
01:29:31,572 --> 01:29:34,033
Get those creative juices flowing.

1200
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:36,160
Oh, I think I have to go to bed.

1201
01:29:36,285 --> 01:29:38,871
Come on. Look, they're playing our song.

1202
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,374
"Mack The Knife" was our song?

1203
01:29:52,510 --> 01:29:55,304
See?

1204
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:57,473
Not so bad, huh?

1205
01:29:58,683 --> 01:30:00,727
Not so bad.

1206
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:07,859
It's nice dancing together again.

1207
01:30:08,985 --> 01:30:11,029
Yeah.

1208
01:30:13,031 --> 01:30:16,951
Do you remember the first time?

1209
01:30:18,703 --> 01:30:21,205
Your sister's wedding in Connecticut?

1210
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:26,502
Yeah, it was beautiful
with all those red leaves falling.

1211
01:30:27,253 --> 01:30:29,339
I'd love to go back some time.

1212
01:30:29,464 --> 01:30:31,132
Mm.

1213
01:30:31,257 --> 01:30:33,301
So would l.

1214
01:30:36,971 --> 01:30:39,390
What happened to us?
Why'd you give up on us?

1215
01:30:41,267 --> 01:30:44,896
I don't know. I think we... did it too fast,
you know.

1216
01:30:45,021 --> 01:30:49,233
I was just a kid then,
falling in love with architecture.

1217
01:30:49,442 --> 01:30:51,736
I never fell in love with architecture, but

1218
01:30:52,612 --> 01:30:54,655
I know I fell in love with you.

1219
01:30:55,656 --> 01:30:57,367
That's bullshit.

1220
01:30:57,492 --> 01:31:00,244
Ah, well, hey. It used... It used to work.

1221
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:25,103
Oh, God, I'm sorry, I can't do this.

1222
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,772
This is wrong. I have to go home.

1223
01:31:27,897 --> 01:31:30,566
You have to go home?

1224
01:31:32,235 --> 01:31:34,278
To be a baby-sitter?

1225
01:31:34,904 --> 01:31:36,948
Don't say that.

1226
01:31:41,744 --> 01:31:42,870
Amy.

1227
01:32:01,139 --> 01:32:02,223
Virgil?

1228
01:32:10,565 --> 01:32:11,816
Virgil?!

1229
01:32:11,941 --> 01:32:14,110
- He's gone, Amy.
- Gone?

1230
01:32:14,235 --> 01:32:15,403
Gone where?

1231
01:32:15,528 --> 01:32:18,406
The park.
Said he was looking for something.

1232
01:32:38,009 --> 01:32:39,052
Virgil!

1233
01:32:41,304 --> 01:32:43,348
Hey, Virgil!

1234
01:32:48,519 --> 01:32:50,063
Virgil, watch out!

1235
01:32:50,188 --> 01:32:52,648
Watch out!

1236
01:32:53,816 --> 01:32:57,362
Jesus, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1237
01:32:57,487 --> 01:33:00,490
I was watching the cab
as it got closer to me.

1238
01:33:00,615 --> 01:33:02,241
It's perspective.

1239
01:33:02,367 --> 01:33:06,371
Yeah, but you'll get yourself killed
doing that in the street.

1240
01:33:06,537 --> 01:33:08,915
I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry.

1241
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:14,128
Oh, boy.

1242
01:33:14,253 --> 01:33:18,716
I went to the loft and you weren't there.
I thought that you had left.

1243
01:33:19,509 --> 01:33:21,552
I thought about it.

1244
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,056
So, I came out here

1245
01:33:25,181 --> 01:33:29,143
to try and see the horizon
that you described so beautifully.

1246
01:33:32,397 --> 01:33:37,068
Oh... Oh, well you can't see it from here.
There's too many buildings.

1247
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:40,863
But that doesn't mean
it's not still here, right?

1248
01:33:40,988 --> 01:33:44,617
Just because you can't see it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

1249
01:33:44,742 --> 01:33:48,329
Right. Just because you can't see things

1250
01:33:48,454 --> 01:33:53,918
doesn't mean that they don't exist.
I mean, that... that's what faith is, right?

1251
01:33:56,504 --> 01:33:57,839
What's that look?

1252
01:33:57,964 --> 01:34:00,717
What does that look mean?
That's a new look.

1253
01:34:02,468 --> 01:34:04,846
Virgil, I have to tell you something.

1254
01:34:05,138 --> 01:34:07,181
I was getting confused.

1255
01:34:07,306 --> 01:34:10,184
But that doesn't excuse how I've acted.

1256
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:16,357
See, I thought I saw you slipping
further and further away from me.

1257
01:34:16,482 --> 01:34:20,445
And I didn't see
that you were slipping away from me.

1258
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:22,196
I...

1259
01:34:22,321 --> 01:34:26,409
Amy, uh, oh...
I don't know why I didn't tell you, but

1260
01:34:26,534 --> 01:34:28,578
I want to say this. When...

1261
01:34:29,412 --> 01:34:32,540
Well, Jennie came to see me
and I went to see my father.

1262
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:35,376
And I couldn't see him.

1263
01:34:37,628 --> 01:34:39,589
I was afraid.

1264
01:34:39,714 --> 01:34:41,924
I... felt like I was letting him down.

1265
01:34:42,633 --> 01:34:44,761
Like I feel like I've let you down.

1266
01:34:46,763 --> 01:34:48,806
The only thing I ever wanted

1267
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:52,685
was to be whole.

1268
01:34:53,728 --> 01:34:56,022
Not just to be able to ride a bike,

1269
01:34:56,606 --> 01:34:59,609
or play in the playground like other kids,

1270
01:34:59,734 --> 01:35:01,778
or go on a date.

1271
01:35:04,322 --> 01:35:07,158
But to be whole,
to be needed by somebody,

1272
01:35:07,909 --> 01:35:09,952
Iike I needed them.

1273
01:35:12,872 --> 01:35:16,668
And the first time I ever felt like that
was with you.

1274
01:35:20,505 --> 01:35:24,842
I know I have a lot to learn,
but I can see.

1275
01:35:27,053 --> 01:35:29,263
And I don't want you to give up on me.

1276
01:35:31,891 --> 01:35:34,185
I won't, Virgil.

1277
01:35:36,562 --> 01:35:41,025
When I was in Atlanta
I realised how much that I need you.

1278
01:35:43,277 --> 01:35:45,405
And I want you to come home with me.

1279
01:35:49,409 --> 01:35:51,536
Until the operation, five weeks ago,

1280
01:35:51,661 --> 01:35:54,247
Virgil had been a... touch person.

1281
01:35:55,498 --> 01:36:02,672
Someone whose vocabulary, whose
sensibility, whose picture of the world

1282
01:36:02,797 --> 01:36:05,842
is based on tactile, non-visual terms.

1283
01:36:05,967 --> 01:36:09,220
But now, as a sightedperson,

1284
01:36:09,345 --> 01:36:13,224
by focusing single-mindedly on his goal,

1285
01:36:13,349 --> 01:36:18,855
Virgil has a new-found ability
to understand distance and shape,

1286
01:36:20,565 --> 01:36:22,942
colour, perspective.

1287
01:36:23,651 --> 01:36:27,780
And though there are still miles to go
in his learning process,

1288
01:36:27,905 --> 01:36:32,744
for all medical intents andpurposes,
he is... becoming a seeing person.

1289
01:36:32,869 --> 01:36:34,912
- Hey!
- What?

1290
01:36:35,705 --> 01:36:39,208
You want me to see, don't you?
Aren't I supposed to look?

1291
01:36:39,334 --> 01:36:41,711
- Oh, my God!
- What?

1292
01:36:41,836 --> 01:36:43,796
She is so flirting with you!

1293
01:36:43,921 --> 01:36:45,715
What?

1294
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,884
- What's that look?
- What look?

1295
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:51,304
That look. You have so many looks.

1296
01:36:51,429 --> 01:36:54,766
Uh, it was probably a jealous look, huh?

1297
01:36:58,061 --> 01:37:00,313
It was the response to that look.

1298
01:37:00,438 --> 01:37:03,775
OK, all right.
You wanna see my other looks?

1299
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:07,362
OK, this is what... sad looks like.

1300
01:37:10,281 --> 01:37:14,327
Here is jubilation. Yippee!

1301
01:37:14,452 --> 01:37:15,870
Careful.

1302
01:37:15,995 --> 01:37:19,957
This is, uh, terrible... fear.

1303
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:22,710
Extreme suspicion.

1304
01:37:24,879 --> 01:37:28,091
It's all your fault.
I have an idea!

1305
01:37:28,216 --> 01:37:29,509
Argh! Argh! Argh!

1306
01:37:33,096 --> 01:37:34,806
Rrrargh!

1307
01:37:40,311 --> 01:37:43,773
This is... I love you.

1308
01:37:43,981 --> 01:37:46,442
Oh, this look I love.

1309
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:07,380
Yesterday, the clouds...

1310
01:38:07,505 --> 01:38:10,091
No, in the sky, not my eyes.

1311
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:14,721
Oh, and purple.
Purple's the most amazing colour.

1312
01:38:15,013 --> 01:38:18,891
And Amy said yesterday
that we saw birds and...

1313
01:38:19,183 --> 01:38:21,310
Um, um... What were they?

1314
01:38:21,728 --> 01:38:23,104
- Pigeons.
- Pigeons!

1315
01:38:23,229 --> 01:38:27,233
- Tell her about the fish market.
- Dozens of 'em. And the fish market!

1316
01:38:27,358 --> 01:38:30,236
Salmon and, uh, crabs and octopus.

1317
01:38:30,361 --> 01:38:33,698
How does anyone eat a octopus? OK.

1318
01:38:33,823 --> 01:38:36,868
No, I don't know when I'll be back,
but I'll call soon.

1319
01:38:36,993 --> 01:38:39,037
OK.

1320
01:38:39,245 --> 01:38:40,788
Me, too. Bye.

1321
01:38:40,997 --> 01:38:42,915
OK. Close your eyes.

1322
01:38:46,919 --> 01:38:50,423
- Present.
- Oh, a tie!

1323
01:38:51,299 --> 01:38:53,343
It's a large tie, too.

1324
01:38:55,511 --> 01:38:58,222
There's gonna be an opening
for the lobby.

1325
01:38:58,348 --> 01:39:00,683
They're gonna have a party. And

1326
01:39:00,808 --> 01:39:02,894
I thought we could both
dress up to celebrate.

1327
01:39:03,019 --> 01:39:05,396
It's your first time seeing
any of my work finished.

1328
01:39:05,521 --> 01:39:07,523
- That's great.
- Huh!

1329
01:39:10,526 --> 01:39:11,903
What's the matter?

1330
01:39:12,028 --> 01:39:14,072
Nothing. It's really great.

1331
01:39:14,614 --> 01:39:16,657
I like it a lot.

1332
01:39:17,033 --> 01:39:20,119
You sure? It looks like it fits.

1333
01:39:21,704 --> 01:39:23,748
You look great in it.

1334
01:39:23,873 --> 01:39:25,208
Thanks.

1335
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:56,322
Hey, Virge, Virge! Where are you going?

1336
01:40:05,665 --> 01:40:06,666
OK.

1337
01:40:11,921 --> 01:40:13,881
- What does that mean?
- What?

1338
01:40:14,007 --> 01:40:17,927
This, um, thing you did with your mouth.
What does that mean?

1339
01:40:18,052 --> 01:40:23,641
Well, uh, I'm only...
registering sparks of activity.

1340
01:40:24,058 --> 01:40:27,103
Retinal sparks, followed by nothing.

1341
01:40:28,146 --> 01:40:30,606
So, uh, how long has this been going on?

1342
01:40:30,732 --> 01:40:33,026
A couple of days.

1343
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:35,194
Have a seat.

1344
01:40:37,196 --> 01:40:41,117
Your, uh...
Your retinal function is down 10%.

1345
01:40:41,242 --> 01:40:45,079
I'm afraid the retinal disease
seems to have returned.

1346
01:40:45,204 --> 01:40:48,750
But you corrected that.
You... I was healed of that. So...

1347
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:50,918
Well, l...

1348
01:40:51,669 --> 01:40:54,547
I mean, I don't know whether, uh,

1349
01:40:54,714 --> 01:40:59,635
you didn't have the blood vessels
to supply enough oxygen to your retinas.

1350
01:41:01,262 --> 01:41:04,349
I wish there were an easy way to say this.

1351
01:41:12,774 --> 01:41:14,817
When?

1352
01:41:16,027 --> 01:41:18,071
Well, it's hard to say. Uh...

1353
01:41:19,405 --> 01:41:21,699
A month. Two weeks.

1354
01:41:23,826 --> 01:41:25,870
Today?

1355
01:41:28,706 --> 01:41:30,750
I don't know.

1356
01:42:38,943 --> 01:42:40,987
You look good.

1357
01:42:41,529 --> 01:42:44,198
Hey, how do I look?

1358
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:49,454
I want some answers.

1359
01:42:50,413 --> 01:42:52,457
Why did you leave?

1360
01:42:52,623 --> 01:42:56,794
Because I was blind, or because
I gave up on your idea of me seeing?

1361
01:42:57,503 --> 01:43:01,716
To the point. I like that.
That's something you got from me.

1362
01:43:01,841 --> 01:43:04,594
You make jokes?
I haven't seen you in 20 years,

1363
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:06,554
you find out I can see,
you want to see me,

1364
01:43:06,679 --> 01:43:09,849
- and you make jokes?
- Can we talk about this later?

1365
01:43:09,974 --> 01:43:12,935
No, answer my question.
Why did you leave?

1366
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:21,402
I woke up every morning
and looked at you... and failure.

1367
01:43:21,527 --> 01:43:23,571
My own failures.

1368
01:43:24,739 --> 01:43:27,492
If I couldn't get my own son to see, then...

1369
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:33,539
But it's water under the bridge now, right?

1370
01:43:34,666 --> 01:43:38,461
You can see! Hell, I knew you could!

1371
01:43:38,586 --> 01:43:40,630
Yeah, I can see.

1372
01:43:43,132 --> 01:43:45,259
And I'm going blind again.

1373
01:43:47,595 --> 01:43:49,806
You're the first person I've told.

1374
01:43:51,349 --> 01:43:55,812
I wanted to see you, look in your eyes,
while you explained my whole life.

1375
01:43:57,563 --> 01:44:00,149
You know what you did to Jennie?
To my mom?

1376
01:44:01,943 --> 01:44:05,154
You shouldn't have done that,... Dad.

1377
01:44:06,072 --> 01:44:08,116
You shouldn't have left.

1378
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:11,494
You shouldn't have left.

1379
01:44:46,612 --> 01:44:50,533
Yeah, a little bit higher, like an inch...
Half inch. Good.

1380
01:44:51,117 --> 01:44:53,578
Hold that thought, wait.

1381
01:44:53,703 --> 01:44:55,747
Hey!

1382
01:44:56,789 --> 01:44:58,833
What are you doing here?

1383
01:45:00,084 --> 01:45:03,796
God, I didn't want you to see it yet.
It's not done.

1384
01:45:03,921 --> 01:45:05,506
I came to see you.

1385
01:45:05,631 --> 01:45:08,301
I wanted to tell you something. OK?

1386
01:45:11,304 --> 01:45:13,639
I had this idea, OK? Bear with me.

1387
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:17,226
Cos things are going so great
and you're doing so well,

1388
01:45:17,352 --> 01:45:21,856
and I've got the Atlanta mall,
so we've got more money coming in,

1389
01:45:21,981 --> 01:45:27,987
I thought that we could take a trip.
A sort of, um, a seeing celebration.

1390
01:45:28,112 --> 01:45:30,156
A seeing celebration?

1391
01:45:30,573 --> 01:45:31,574
Yeah.

1392
01:45:31,699 --> 01:45:35,161
I thought that we could, um,
that we could go to Egypt.

1393
01:45:35,286 --> 01:45:37,830
We can both see the pyramids
for the first time.

1394
01:45:37,955 --> 01:45:40,958
- Amy...
- And then I could take you to Paris.

1395
01:45:41,084 --> 01:45:43,336
I could show you Notre Dame,

1396
01:45:43,461 --> 01:45:47,215
with the gargoyles
and the water with the light on it,

1397
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:51,719
and the stained glass. You'll love it.
There's so much I want to show you.

1398
01:45:51,844 --> 01:45:55,973
The windows and the water.
We'd have the most wonderful time.

1399
01:45:56,933 --> 01:45:58,976
What do you think?

1400
01:46:02,939 --> 01:46:04,982
I think...

1401
01:46:08,027 --> 01:46:11,489
There is...
There is one place I'd like to see.

1402
01:46:54,532 --> 01:46:56,576
Whoo!

1403
01:48:15,405 --> 01:48:17,615
Virgil! Virgil.

1404
01:48:23,454 --> 01:48:26,165
- Are you OK?
- The puffy thing.

1405
01:48:27,458 --> 01:48:30,586
This is the puffy thing. This is the cloud?

1406
01:48:31,629 --> 01:48:35,717
You found the puffy thing.
Oh, my God! It's cotton candy.

1407
01:48:36,134 --> 01:48:38,177
Oh, my God.

1408
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:53,443
Thank you so much
for taking me here. This was wonderful.

1409
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:01,909
Are you OK?

1410
01:49:03,202 --> 01:49:05,246
Yeah... I'm just

1411
01:49:05,413 --> 01:49:08,041
having a... bad eye day.

1412
01:49:09,751 --> 01:49:11,794
It's a lot to take in.

1413
01:49:13,129 --> 01:49:15,173
I'm OK now. It's just...

1414
01:49:15,631 --> 01:49:18,843
I'm sorry.
These people wanna get by over here.

1415
01:49:18,968 --> 01:49:21,471
- What?
- These people on the right.

1416
01:49:21,596 --> 01:49:23,890
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Excuse us.

1417
01:49:29,062 --> 01:49:32,732
Honey, what's going on?
What's happening with your eyes?

1418
01:49:35,401 --> 01:49:36,652
Blackouts.

1419
01:49:37,362 --> 01:49:39,364
This one's the longest.

1420
01:49:39,489 --> 01:49:41,991
I just want to go home, OK?

1421
01:49:42,116 --> 01:49:47,580
Baby, wait... one second.
Has this... happened before today?

1422
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:56,214
I'm going blind.

1423
01:49:56,964 --> 01:49:59,008
What?

1424
01:49:59,967 --> 01:50:03,346
What do you mean?
What's wrong? I mean, what...

1425
01:50:03,471 --> 01:50:06,599
You've... had blackouts.
Maybe your eyes are overworked.

1426
01:50:06,724 --> 01:50:09,477
You've been seeing so much,
getting so excited.

1427
01:50:09,602 --> 01:50:12,522
- No.
- We can... go to the doctor

1428
01:50:12,647 --> 01:50:16,317
and he'll tell us what's happening.
I mean, maybe, you know,

1429
01:50:16,442 --> 01:50:20,530
- it's just been too fast...
- Amy, can we just go home?

1430
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:26,160
Baby, let's go to the doctor...

1431
01:50:26,285 --> 01:50:29,330
I saw Dr Aaron.
There's nothing they can do.

1432
01:50:29,455 --> 01:50:31,332
We'll go to another doctor.

1433
01:50:31,457 --> 01:50:34,877
What... do you want me to say?
You want it explained another way?

1434
01:50:35,003 --> 01:50:37,046
I'm going blind.

1435
01:50:37,547 --> 01:50:40,842
- Let's...
- That's what's happening. I'm going blind.

1436
01:50:40,967 --> 01:50:43,011
I just...

1437
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:45,430
..wanna go home.

1438
01:50:46,055 --> 01:50:49,183
Baby, don't give up.
We got... We got you to s...

1439
01:50:49,308 --> 01:50:51,352
I just want to go home.

1440
01:50:59,986 --> 01:51:02,030
It was a good game.

1441
01:51:19,547 --> 01:51:21,591
What are you doing?

1442
01:51:22,008 --> 01:51:24,052
I'm leaving.

1443
01:51:24,177 --> 01:51:28,556
What do you mean?
You're leaving... this apartment?

1444
01:51:28,848 --> 01:51:32,101
You're leaving New York,
or you're leaving me?

1445
01:51:33,061 --> 01:51:35,104
I'm going home.

1446
01:51:37,231 --> 01:51:39,484
What, are you going home to Jennie?

1447
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:46,949
Is she gonna take care of you now?

1448
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:49,827
I'm not going through this bullshit again.

1449
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:51,162
Bullshit?

1450
01:51:52,246 --> 01:51:57,919
- That's what this has been? Bullshit?
- Yes, it's bullshit! Who are we kidding?

1451
01:51:58,378 --> 01:52:00,421
I'm blind. I can't see.

1452
01:52:00,546 --> 01:52:03,216
OK? I don't belong here.
I'm not meant to see.

1453
01:52:03,341 --> 01:52:08,054
Goddamn right, you're blind.
I'm here for you, and you don't even look.

1454
01:52:09,639 --> 01:52:11,683
Why are you shutting me out?

1455
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:15,395
Why didn't you tell me
what was going on with you?

1456
01:52:16,312 --> 01:52:19,899
Do you know
why I remembered the cotton candy?

1457
01:52:20,274 --> 01:52:24,654
Because it's the one thing in my life
I remember with my father that was good.

1458
01:52:24,779 --> 01:52:28,533
After I went blind, he pushed to try
to make me into something that I'm not.

1459
01:52:28,658 --> 01:52:31,577
Then he turns his back on me
when his plans fail.

1460
01:52:31,703 --> 01:52:33,830
But I'm not turning my back on you.

1461
01:52:34,247 --> 01:52:36,791
I promised you I wouldn't give up on you.

1462
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:41,212
Don't give up on me!
Give up on the idea of me seeing!

1463
01:52:41,337 --> 01:52:44,173
Didn't you want something more
out of your life?

1464
01:52:44,298 --> 01:52:47,051
That's all I wanted
to give you a chance for.

1465
01:52:47,176 --> 01:52:51,014
Jesus Christ! Did you think
you'd sit in that school bus

1466
01:52:51,139 --> 01:52:53,558
and work in the spa the rest of your life?

1467
01:52:53,683 --> 01:52:57,437
Didn't you have dreams?
To see or learn or do more than that?

1468
01:52:57,562 --> 01:53:02,483
- You have so much to give of yourself.
- And so much to be taken away.

1469
01:53:03,192 --> 01:53:05,445
Oh, God... Agh!

1470
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:09,907
Goddammit.

1471
01:53:11,743 --> 01:53:13,786
Your sculpture.

1472
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,083
I'm sorry.

1473
01:53:20,126 --> 01:53:23,713
It's just...
We both didn't get what we wanted.

1474
01:53:26,215 --> 01:53:28,259
I wanted you.

1475
01:53:29,719 --> 01:53:33,556
When you asked me here
did you ever think it wouldn't work out?

1476
01:53:33,681 --> 01:53:36,392
That... I might not be able to see?

1477
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:43,066
Did you ever think about
what it would be like to just

1478
01:53:43,191 --> 01:53:47,445
be with me, the blind man?

1479
01:53:55,036 --> 01:53:57,080
There's my answer.

1480
01:54:36,869 --> 01:54:40,832
Jessie, aah... Iook at you.
Let me look at you.

1481
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:44,419
What a beautiful colour you are.

1482
01:54:46,337 --> 01:54:48,798
What a good dog.

1483
01:54:48,923 --> 01:54:52,719
Everything's the same as when you left.
Nothing's changed.

1484
01:56:36,698 --> 01:56:38,741
- Hello?
- Hi.

1485
01:56:38,866 --> 01:56:40,910
Hi.

1486
01:56:41,953 --> 01:56:43,997
Hey, Jess.

1487
01:56:44,956 --> 01:56:47,000
Hi.

1488
01:56:47,291 --> 01:56:49,669
I picked up some things at the store.

1489
01:56:49,794 --> 01:56:53,464
Some, uh, T-shirts...
Socks, you're probably out.

1490
01:56:53,589 --> 01:56:55,466
You are so beautiful.

1491
01:56:57,427 --> 01:57:00,388
Why didn't you tell me
you were beautiful?

1492
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:04,058
I just told you
what you needed to know, that's all.

1493
01:57:05,018 --> 01:57:07,061
Look at me.

1494
01:57:07,186 --> 01:57:09,605
Why do people look away?

1495
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:15,403
What do you want?

1496
01:57:15,778 --> 01:57:17,822
I want to see you.

1497
01:57:18,156 --> 01:57:20,783
Isn't there anything more you want?

1498
01:57:20,908 --> 01:57:24,454
You've spent your whole life
as blind as I was.

1499
01:57:24,579 --> 01:57:27,498
Virgil, please. This is your home.

1500
01:57:27,623 --> 01:57:32,086
Don't worry about things
that don't matter to you. You're safe here.

1501
01:57:32,211 --> 01:57:36,132
You matter to me.
This was a great place to grow up.

1502
01:57:36,257 --> 01:57:38,301
It was very safe.

1503
01:57:38,968 --> 01:57:41,012
But I grew up.

1504
01:57:42,388 --> 01:57:45,683
I can't even imagine
the things you gave up for me.

1505
01:57:45,808 --> 01:57:48,561
I just want to look at you.
Look at me, Jennie.

1506
01:57:49,979 --> 01:57:53,691
I wanna say thank you.
I love you from the bottom of my soul.

1507
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:56,903
And I want to give you your life back.

1508
01:58:05,578 --> 01:58:06,579
I can't.

1509
01:58:08,247 --> 01:58:10,291
Yes, you can.

1510
01:58:13,252 --> 01:58:15,296
Jennie,...

1511
01:58:17,632 --> 01:58:19,676
..l'm reaching out.

1512
01:59:29,203 --> 01:59:32,040
Growing up blind, I had two dreams.

1513
01:59:32,915 --> 01:59:34,959
One was to see.

1514
01:59:35,084 --> 01:59:38,171
The other was to play hockey
for the New York Rangers.

1515
01:59:40,423 --> 01:59:44,844
After the... miracle
of my brief period of sight,

1516
01:59:45,136 --> 01:59:49,932
if I had to choose, I'd rather play hockey
for the New York Rangers.

1517
01:59:51,601 --> 01:59:55,855
It wasn't that seeing was so bad.
I saw a lot of things.

1518
01:59:55,980 --> 02:00:00,985
Um, some were really beautiful.
Others were scary.

1519
02:00:03,196 --> 02:00:06,032
Some things, I'm, um, already forgetting.

1520
02:00:08,534 --> 02:00:10,995
A particular look in a pair ofeyes,

1521
02:00:12,789 --> 02:00:14,832
clouds.

1522
02:00:17,293 --> 02:00:22,173
Those images will stay with me
long after the light fades.

1523
02:00:24,467 --> 02:00:28,930
As a blind man, I think that I see

1524
02:00:29,055 --> 02:00:33,309
a lot better than I did
while I was sighted.

1525
02:00:34,644 --> 02:00:37,772
Because I don't really think
we see with our eyes.

1526
02:00:38,773 --> 02:00:42,402
I think, um, we live in darkness when

1527
02:00:43,027 --> 02:00:46,322
we don't look at
what's real about ourselves,

1528
02:00:46,948 --> 02:00:49,867
or about others, or about life.

1529
02:00:51,077 --> 02:00:55,248
I think, uh, no operation can do that.

1530
02:00:55,748 --> 02:00:56,749
And

1531
02:00:57,917 --> 02:01:00,294
when you see what's real

1532
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,463
about yourself,

1533
02:01:03,172 --> 02:01:04,966
then you've seen a lot.

1534
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:06,300
Good boy.

1535
02:01:06,426 --> 02:01:08,469
And you don't need eyes for that.

1536
02:01:09,137 --> 02:01:11,180
Want a bite?

1537
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:29,282
- You missed.
- Missed?

1538
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:30,867
Amy?

1539
02:01:32,076 --> 02:01:33,077
Hey.

1540
02:01:34,412 --> 02:01:35,413
Hi.

1541
02:01:40,543 --> 02:01:42,545
Um...

1542
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:44,630
I was just in the neighbourhood.

1543
02:01:47,175 --> 02:01:50,386
No, uh, Phil told me
that you were working here.

1544
02:01:51,095 --> 02:01:54,349
And I thought
maybe I could find you in the park.

1545
02:01:56,434 --> 02:02:02,231
I rushed, didn't l? 14 paces to the tree,
and I made us slam right into it.

1546
02:02:02,357 --> 02:02:04,400
We tried.

1547
02:02:04,734 --> 02:02:06,861
Are you happy?

1548
02:02:07,945 --> 02:02:09,989
I'm... I'm trying to be.

1549
02:02:10,990 --> 02:02:13,117
Work is good. I went out on my own.

1550
02:02:13,242 --> 02:02:15,203
What happened to Duncan?

1551
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:17,288
He's building mini malls.

1552
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:21,709
Where's Jessie?

1553
02:02:21,834 --> 02:02:24,712
Jessie's at home with Jennie.
This is Pierce.

1554
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:26,881
My new dog.

1555
02:02:27,799 --> 02:02:29,717
He's a good boy.

1556
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:31,636
Hello, Pierce.

1557
02:02:31,761 --> 02:02:33,805
Hello, sweetie.

1558
02:02:37,183 --> 02:02:39,394
Virgil, I finished the sculpture.

1559
02:02:40,561 --> 02:02:42,939
I didn't know where it was going to go.

1560
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:45,483
But that was OK.

1561
02:02:46,943 --> 02:02:50,029
I really enjoyed
letting it take on its own life.

1562
02:02:50,321 --> 02:02:52,407
Letting it be just what it was.

1563
02:02:52,532 --> 02:02:55,910
Without me pushing or doubting myself.

1564
02:02:57,662 --> 02:03:00,164
And what it was, was beautiful.

1565
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:03,710
I saw the horizon.

1566
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:06,921
It's out there.

1567
02:03:08,131 --> 02:03:11,050
Even though I may not
ever be able to touch it,

1568
02:03:12,844 --> 02:03:14,887
it's worth reaching for.

1569
02:03:18,391 --> 02:03:20,435
You showed me that.

1570
02:03:24,522 --> 02:03:26,774
Thank you.

1571
02:03:33,614 --> 02:03:35,658
Um...

1572
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:39,370
- Do you wanna walk?
- See what we see?

1573
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:44,167
Yeah, just... see what we see.

1574
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:22,330
- Lead on, Macduff.
- OK.
