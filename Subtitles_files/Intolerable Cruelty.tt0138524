1
00:00:55,895 --> 00:01:00,480
I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told

2
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,360
I have squandered my resistance

3
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:08,610
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises

4
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,620
All lies and jests

5
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,750
Just a come-on from those gals
on Seventh Avenue

6
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,555
So lonesome that I took some comfort there

7
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:23,190
-Bonnie?
Who is it?

8
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,740
Donovan?

9
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,115
-Bonnie?
-Yes?

10
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,245
Donovan!

11
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:47,590
In here.

12
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,020
-Yes? Donovan, is everything all right?
-Yeah, the production meeting was put off,

13
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,356
-so I thought... Who's here?
-Here?

14
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:06,609
Hmm. Who owns that piece-of-shit van
down there?

15
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:07,943
Oh!

16
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:13,157
It's just a guy going door to door
selling pool cleaner.

17
00:03:13,783 --> 00:03:15,910
So why'd he lock himself in the den?

18
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:19,705
Well, he... Oh, God.

19
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:25,628
-You remember my friend Ollie?
-Ollie Olerud? Short, cretinous wanker.

20
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:29,215
-Ollie's in there?
-Yes.

21
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,592
I see.

22
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:35,888
Well, I'm glad he finally got himself a job.

23
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:40,309
I'd always picked him as some sort of
deadbeat, but happy to be proved wrong.

24
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:44,188
So he's selling pool cleaner now?
Well, this is the neighborhood for that.

25
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:46,774
Just door to door, "Running low
on chlorine?" That kind of thing.

26
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:51,779
It’s quite a coincidence him dropping by,
and you two knowing each other so well.

27
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:54,573
Donovan, please. Let's just all talk.
I mean, I think...

28
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:58,077
How you doing, Donovan?
How you doing, man?

29
00:03:58,161 --> 00:04:00,913
Good day, Ollie. I’m great. You?

30
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:05,876
-Hey, can't complain, man.
-Excellent.

31
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,087
Well, let's get right down to it, then,
shall we?

32
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,547
We'll take a couple of vacuum hoses.

33
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:13,592
We probably need a new filter
around about now. Maybe...

34
00:04:13,677 --> 00:04:16,804
Wait a minute, darling.
Do we actually have a swimming pool?

35
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:20,766
Okay. Okay, man.
Now let's be reasonable about this, okay?

36
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,770
So you caught me porking...
Having relations with your old lady.

37
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:25,854
God.

38
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:30,484
And now, we're all feeling just a little bit
embarrassed by the whole thing, so...

39
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:36,031
What the hey, man? I mean,
I know it's a drag and all, but these things...

40
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:41,370
Hey! Hey, hey. We didn't actually have sex.

41
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:46,041
I was depressed,
'cause I’m impotent, you know.

42
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:48,627
Unable to achieve an erection.

43
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:53,716
I have been for over a year now, man,
and I needed someone to talk to.

44
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,719
I mean, think about it, man.
A year without an erection?

45
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,512
Leave him alone!

46
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:05,644
You should have seen this coming,
you Australian piece of shit!

47
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,857
Bitch. That's my Daytime Television
Lifetime Achievement Award.

48
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:11,150
Cheesy bastard!

49
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,738
You whore!

50
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,992
Christ!

51
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:23,579
Okay!

52
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:29,084
All right, you want fun and games? All right.

53
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,298
I'll give you fun and games.
Explain this away.

54
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:44,266
Ollie!

55
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:46,977
That's my Jag! That's my Jag!

56
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:49,980
That's my bloody Jag!

57
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:54,943
You bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

58
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:57,613
Bye-bye, baby!

59
00:05:59,407 --> 00:06:01,116
Oh, what are you looking at?

60
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:09,500
Explain this away, darling.

61
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:51,703
Miles Massey's office.
-Hey, it's me. Any messages?

62
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:54,206
-Yeah. Quite a few. Where are you?
-Just whitening.

63
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,166
Jim says he wants a meeting today
if possible.

64
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:59,044
-What else?
-Chapman says his wife is now in Tahoe.

65
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:01,713
All right, tell Amstedler
I’ll return in 20 minutes.

66
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:05,467
Get Wrigley to look up Oliphant V. Oliphant,
Commonwealth of Virginia,

67
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:07,386
for its relevance in the Chapman filing.

68
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,471
Oliphant v. Oliphant. Relevance in Chapman.

69
00:09:09,556 --> 00:09:11,098
She said she took the kids to Tahoe?

70
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:12,849
-That's right.
-Wait. Which side of Tahoe?

71
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,017
She said it was a cruise.

72
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:16,937
Yeah, well, if the cruise goes
all the way around the lake,

73
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:18,480
she's left the state, and she's in breach.

74
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:22,067
Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to attach.

75
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:27,239
Everything. Primary residence, beach house,
ski cabin, auto, stocks, bonds, dental floss.

76
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:28,407
Gonna lose you.

77
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,575
Uh-huh.

78
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,326
And tell Fred Armatrading that

79
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:33,996
we have pictures of his wife
with the oral surgeon.

80
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,457
Oh, and get a fruit and pastry basket
in the conference room for my 9:30.

81
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,917
Didn't have time for breakfast this morning.

82
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:42,421
-Where are you?
-Coming at you.

83
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:46,174
-Your 9:00 is here. Bonnie Donaly.
-Bonnie Donaly.

84
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,684
Mrs. Donaly.

85
00:10:08,197 --> 00:10:12,034
Yes, your husband did show remarkable
foresight in taking those pictures.

86
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:15,746
And, yes, absent a swimming pool,

87
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,665
the presence of a pool man
would appear to be suspicious.

88
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,712
But, madam, who is the real victim here?
Let me suggest to you the following.

89
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:27,466
Your husband, who on a prior occasion
had slapped you, beat you.

90
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,509
-l think that word is not inappropriate.
-No, l...

91
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:33,555
Let me finish, please. I’m not concerned
with who slapped whom first.

92
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,599
Your husband,
who had beaten you repeatedly...

93
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:36,683
No, he never...

94
00:10:36,768 --> 00:10:39,978
Please. Repeatedly, was at the time,
brandishing your firearm.

95
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:42,064
-It was his gun.
-And we'll get it back for you.

96
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:47,569
Trying, in his rage, to shoot an
acquaintance, a friend of long standing.

97
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:48,737
They never really cared for each other.

98
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:51,907
And if not for your cool-headed intervention,

99
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:54,951
his tantrum might have ended
this schmo's life and ruined his own.

100
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:59,790
As for the sexual indiscretion
which he imagined took place,

101
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:03,335
wasn't it, in fact,
he who was sleeping with the pool man?

102
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:10,175
No? Am I going too far here?
Were his sexual... No.

103
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,260
-l don't...
-Sorry. I’m not omniscient.

104
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:16,223
The point is that he acted upon
an assumption which he cannot prove,

105
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:19,017
and, I take it, you deny.

106
00:11:19,102 --> 00:11:20,977
-Well...
-Fine. I’ll take the case.

107
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:24,356
It’s imperative that I meet with Oliver Olerud
before we proceed any further,

108
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,527
so that I can massage
the kinks out of our testimony.

109
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:30,737
Do you really think
we could put all this across?

110
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:33,990
The truth is so self-evident to me,
Mrs. Donaly,

111
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:38,412
that I’m sure that I’ll be able to make it
equally as transparent to any jury,

112
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:40,372
should your husband decide
to take it that far.

113
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:44,209
We'll need to caucus again to draw up
a picture of your husband's net worth.

114
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:48,130
A map of enemy territory, so to speak.
You said that he's a television producer?

115
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:51,299
He has a soap opera, The Sands of Time.
It’s a silly show.

116
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:54,720
Well, it'll be yours soon.
Thank you very much.

117
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:58,348
-Oh, thank you, Mr. Massey.
-Yes. Bye-bye.

118
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:04,062
Still you have to admire him
for taking those pictures.

119
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:07,566
Now, Mrs. Gutman, you testified

120
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:13,572
that you were your husband's sexual slave
for 36 years during your marriage.

121
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:17,617
Except for two years when he was
in the Navy in Southeast Asia.

122
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:20,579
And before your marriage,
what was your profession?

123
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:23,290
I was a hostess
for Braniff Airlines.

124
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:25,709
And what is your husband's profession?

125
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:31,173
He manufactures staples and industrial
brad tacks. He's very successful.

126
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:36,094
How would you describe
your husband's sexual proclivities?

127
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:40,682
Well, at first,
he was a very gentle and tender lover.

128
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:43,477
But then he became more and more fixated

129
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:46,313
on toys and machinery
and devices of various kinds.

130
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:50,609
I can't help it. You don't decide
to become bored. It just happens.

131
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,862
You're just looking for trouble.
It’s a midlife crisis.

132
00:12:53,946 --> 00:12:57,073
Look, get yourself a new car.

133
00:12:57,158 --> 00:13:02,412
I have a new car. I have two new cars.
I have a tab at the Mercedes dealership.

134
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:06,291
Torn the house down twice.
Rebuilt the cabin in Vail.

135
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,794
Got three of those yard people.

136
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:12,339
-Gardeners.
-Gardeners. Got a man who waxes my jet.

137
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:17,469
These encounters were videotaped.
Sometimes there would be a gismo.

138
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:22,015
A gismo?
-He had a device he called The intruder.

139
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,893
It was something he had the engineers
at the factory design.

140
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:29,105
And then he had a prototype built
out of the parts from our vacuum cleaner.

141
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,232
I see.

142
00:13:30,316 --> 00:13:33,318
So the vacuum cleaner wasn't available
to me for several months.

143
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:36,780
-Several months without the appliance?
-Yes.

144
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:39,157
Problem is
everyone is willing to compromise.

145
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:43,703
That's the problem with the institution
of marriage. It’s based on compromise.

146
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:46,832
Even through its dissolution.
Mrs. Gutman here,

147
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:50,252
she's gonna score some points concerning
her husband's sexual politics.

148
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:51,795
Naturally, we'll try to impeach.

149
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,257
And then the entire process
will find an equilibrium point

150
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:57,843
based on the skill of the individual lawyers.

151
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:01,847
And then both parties will go home
with their portion of the staple factory.

152
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:06,059
-That's life. Life is compromise.
-That's not life. That's death.

153
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:13,066
Struggle and challenge and ultimate
destruction of your opponent, that's life.

154
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:19,990
Let me ask you something. Attila the Hun.
Ivan the Terrible. Henry the Eighth.

155
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,616
What do they have in common?

156
00:14:23,786 --> 00:14:26,371
-Middle name?
-No, they didn't just win.

157
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:29,541
-They destroyed.
Mr. Massey? Mr. Massey?

158
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,795
Again I ask, have you any questions
for the complainant?

159
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:39,259
I’m sorry, Your Honor.
I was just consulting with an associate.

160
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:45,181
Now, Mrs. Gutman, do you know
a man named David Gonzalez?

161
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:50,186
Well, he's the tennis pro at the club.

162
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:52,647
The tennis pro?

163
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:58,987
Then why are your letters addressed
to him, "Dear, David and Goliath"?

164
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:26,014
Go, Rexie! Go, Rexie, baby!

165
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,493
Cabin seven.

166
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:46,094
I’m gonna nail your ass.

167
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:48,304
Oh, yeah. I’m gonna nail your ass.

168
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:53,977
Boy, I’m gonna nail your ass. Your ass.
The old billionaire.

169
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:55,645
Come to papa. Come on.

170
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,897
I'm gonna get it. I got it.

171
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:01,359
I’m gonna nail your ass.

172
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:05,071
I'm gonna nail your ass. Yeah.

173
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:08,825
This is a silly misunderstanding.
-I'm gonna nail your ass.

174
00:17:08,909 --> 00:17:10,035
Get that thing off me now!

175
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:15,248
Yeah, I'm gonna nail your ass. I'm gonna
nail your ass. I'm gonna nail your ass!

176
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,625
Yep. I nailed his ass.

177
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,587
I thought he'd outgrown trains.

178
00:17:20,671 --> 00:17:23,590
They never grow up, lady.
They just get tubby.

179
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:26,134
How charming. An aphorist.

180
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:30,597
Oh, yeah, I've always had ample proportions
but believe you me, it's all muscle.

181
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:31,723
I’m as hard as a rock.

182
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:34,392
I’m not one of these cream-puff,
sit-behind-a-desk private dicks.

183
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:36,436
-I’m an ass nailer.
-So I see.

184
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,814
Gym four times a week.
Hour and a half, plus stretching.

185
00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:44,152
Lifecycle. Life step. Life circuit.
Gus Petch don't pussyfoot around.

186
00:17:44,236 --> 00:17:48,573
I must say, for someone in your line of work,
you don't exhibit a great deal of tact.

187
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:53,203
You want tact, call a tactician.
You want an ass nailed, you call Gus Petch.

188
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,371
Christ, you seem to be taking it pretty good.

189
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:59,209
I’ve seen them come in here
weep and wail like Baptists at a funeral.

190
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:02,712
Like they hired me to prove
their husbands weren't fooling around.

191
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:06,549
-Don't get me wrong, Mr...
-Petch. Gus Petch.

192
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:12,597
Whilst I don't find this terribly amusing,
I am delighted that you found this material.

193
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:19,395
This is going to be my passport to wealth,
independence and freedom.

194
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:24,192
Sounds like to me you gonna nail his ass.

195
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,868
Honey? Honey?

196
00:18:34,203 --> 00:18:36,204
Rex, get away from the door.

197
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:43,753
Honey? My key doesn't work.
Can we talk about this?

198
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:46,297
Rex, get away from the door.

199
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:48,049
Oh, look, I know that you're upset, honey.

200
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:51,803
Rex, for your own safety,
get away from the door.

201
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:56,641
-I don't like having to set the dogs on you.
-For crying out loud. lf we could... Dogs?

202
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,953
Yes, dogs. I wanted some security
since I'II be living here alone.

203
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:19,706
Look, Marylyn, can't we have
a civilized discussion about this?

204
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,790
Our lawyers can.

205
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,504
You've a discovery hearing at 5:30
for the Maxine Gopnik case.

206
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:28,006
-Discovery. Gopnik.
-And a Lance Kelso called.

207
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,675
He read your article about palimony
settlements in same-sex partnerships.

208
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,843
Lance Kelso.

209
00:19:31,927 --> 00:19:33,678
-And would like to schedule an appointment.
-Same-sex.

210
00:19:33,762 --> 00:19:36,764
Arthur Yardumian and his tax attorney want
to reschedule their caucus for tomorrow.

211
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:37,849
Yardumian.

212
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:39,475
Arthur had to fly to Atlanta
for a deadbeat dad hearing.

213
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,564
-Atlanta.
-And your 1 0:30 is here. Rex Rexroth.

214
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:47,775
-Rex Rexroth?
-Real estate. He's okay.

215
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:54,699
-Mr. Rexroth.
-Call me Rex, please.

216
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:57,619
Miles Massey. Please, sit. Relax.

217
00:19:57,703 --> 00:20:00,955
Consider this office your office, your haven,

218
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,083
your war room
for the duration of the campaign.

219
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:09,380
-Thank you.
-Now, sir, tell me your troubles.

220
00:20:09,465 --> 00:20:13,760
Well, my wife has me
between a rock and a hard place.

221
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:15,970
That's her job. You should respect that.

222
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:19,933
When I first met Marylyn,
we were crazy about each other.

223
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:23,561
Not emotionally, of course. Just we couldn't
keep our hands off each other.

224
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:26,147
But then... Then...

225
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:32,153
-Time marches on. Ardor cools.
-Yeah.

226
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:36,074
So we had an understanding.

227
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:39,077
-Whereby?
-We could see other people.

228
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:43,665
Has Mrs. Rexroth pursued the opportunities
implicit in your arrangement?

229
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:46,084
I can only assume.

230
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:49,504
Not in court you can't.
Has she retained counsel?

231
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,674
I don't know. She has Rottweilers.

232
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:58,846
Not a good sign. And have you, yourself,
exploited your understood freedom?

233
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:05,353
There's a lady, a young lady.
She lets me be myself.

234
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:10,358
Of course.
And your wife is aware and/or has evidence?

235
00:21:10,442 --> 00:21:11,776
-Video.
-Ha!

236
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:18,199
To cut to the chase, forensically speaking,
is there a prenup?

237
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:28,167
"The fault, dear Brutus,
lies not in our stars, but in ourselves."

238
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:31,921
Let me ask you this,
what kind of a settlement do you seek?

239
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:35,133
What are, for you,
the parameters of the possible?

240
00:21:35,217 --> 00:21:39,262
Well, that's the problem.
I can't afford to give her anything.

241
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:44,475
Nothing?

242
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,394
Well, yeah,
I know that sounds a little rough,

243
00:21:46,478 --> 00:21:50,481
but, listen, I’m about to close a deal
to develop some mini-malls.

244
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:52,317
I am mortgaged up to my heinie.

245
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:55,611
lf this deal goes south, I am ruined.
I will lose millions.

246
00:21:55,696 --> 00:22:01,868
So you propose that, in spite of
demonstrable infidelity on your part,

247
00:22:01,952 --> 00:22:06,080
your unoffending wife
should be tossed out on her ear.

248
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:09,250
Well, is that possible?

249
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:15,882
It’s a challenge.

250
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:19,677
Why don't you come out to Malibu
and see my new beach house tomorrow?

251
00:22:19,762 --> 00:22:23,681
-l didn't know Dimitri had a beach house.
-Neither did I until my lawyer found it.

252
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:26,976
Quite a paper trail.
Had it in the dog's name.

253
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:30,438
Well, tomorrow won't work.
I’m having a body wrap. How's Wednesday?

254
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:32,190
Hair appointment in the morning. Afternoon?

255
00:22:32,274 --> 00:22:34,359
Shrink. How's your Thursday?

256
00:22:34,443 --> 00:22:37,111
I’m having facial injections.
That kills Friday and Saturday.

257
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:39,530
-BOTOX?
-Butt fat.

258
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:42,325
-Does that really work?
-You tell me.

259
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:43,826
Hello, darlings.

260
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:49,374
So, you and Rex are...

261
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:54,045
Well, as my private investigator put it,
"We're gonna nail his ass."

262
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:58,466
I’ve been trying to nail George's ass
for years, but he is so careful.

263
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:05,556
-Are you all right, Claire?
-Down the wrong pipe.

264
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:09,394
-So who's your lawyer?
-Freddy Bender.

265
00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:12,730
I have an appointment this afternoon
with Rex and his schnauzer.

266
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:15,358
So who's Rex's guy?
-Miles Massey.

267
00:23:15,442 --> 00:23:18,528
Miles Massey? Of Massey Myerson?

268
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:20,488
Do you know him?
-By reputation,

269
00:23:20,572 --> 00:23:23,616
and, Marylyn, he's no schnauzer.

270
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,577
He got Phyllis Rumsey
that cute little island of George's.

271
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:29,247
George was so impressed,
he hired him when he divorced his second.

272
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:31,833
-Muriel Rumsey.
-Who's she?

273
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:34,836
Now? Night manager at McDonald's.

274
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,090
But, Marylyn, do we have a man for you.

275
00:23:39,174 --> 00:23:41,008
Thorstenson Gieselensen.

276
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:43,886
-He just separated from his third.
-He's in fish.

277
00:23:43,971 --> 00:23:45,638
-He is fish.
-Well, he's tuna.

278
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:48,808
Ladies, I’m not seeing anyone
until I’ve finished nailing Rex's ass.

279
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:51,727
But, Marylyn, this man is tuna.

280
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:55,189
Sarah, one husband at a time.

281
00:23:57,818 --> 00:24:00,445
I’ll do the talking.
I know you'll be tempted to chime in,

282
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:03,948
but remember that you're
in an emotionally vulnerable state.

283
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:07,702
-I’m the professional.
-Oh. Okay.

284
00:24:08,203 --> 00:24:09,454
Freddy.

285
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:16,961
Freddy Bender, this is Rex Rexroth.
And you are the lovely Marylyn.

286
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:20,882
Please, Ms. Rexroth.
And you must be Mr. Massey.

287
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:23,593
Please, Miles. Sit. Sit down.

288
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:29,724
Freddy, I was sorry to hear
about the Goldberger award. Pastry?

289
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:36,105
We did very well. We did very well.

290
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,649
Not to worry, Mrs. Rexroth,
you're ably represented.

291
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:42,445
I’m sure Freddy's just too modest to tell you
he used to clerk for Clarence Thomas.

292
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:44,155
Pastry? Going begging.

293
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:49,243
Don't try to bait me, Miles. Now
if you have a proposal to make, let's hear it.

294
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:53,998
Well, at this point, my client is still
prepared to consider reconciliation.

295
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:56,792
My client has ruled that out.

296
00:24:56,877 --> 00:24:59,378
My client is prepared
to entertain an amicable dissolution

297
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:02,423
-of the marriage without prejudice.
-That's a fart in a stiff wind.

298
00:25:02,508 --> 00:25:04,842
My client proposes
a 30-day cooling-off period.

299
00:25:04,927 --> 00:25:07,011
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.

300
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:09,180
My client asks
that you not initiate proceedings

301
00:25:09,264 --> 00:25:11,224
pending his setting certain affairs in order.

302
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:17,772
-What's so goddamn funny?
-Please, let me handle this.

303
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:21,901
All right. So much for the icebreakers.
What are you after, Freddy?

304
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:25,154
My client is prepared to settle
for 50% of the marital assets.

305
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:30,743
Why only 50, Freddy? Why not 1 00?

306
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:34,413
While we're dreaming, why not 1 50%?
Are you familiar with Kershner?

307
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:35,623
Kershner does not apply.

308
00:25:35,707 --> 00:25:37,416
Bring this to trial,
we'll see if Kershner applies.

309
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:39,502
-What's Kershner?
-Please, let me handle this.

310
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:41,963
-Kershner was in Kentucky.
-Kershner was in Kentucky?

311
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:43,965
-Kershner was in Kentucky!
-All right, Freddy.

312
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:47,969
-Forget Kershner. What's your bottom line?
-Primary residence, 30% of remaining assets.

313
00:25:48,053 --> 00:25:51,138
What are you, nuts?
Have you forgotten Kershner?

314
00:25:52,641 --> 00:25:56,561
-Freddy. It’s a negotiation.
See you at the preliminary.

315
00:25:56,645 --> 00:26:01,524
Freddy, we're all friends here.
It’s a negotiation. Hey!

316
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:06,362
Freddy! Fine. We'll eat the pastry.

317
00:26:15,998 --> 00:26:17,832
I thought that went well.

318
00:26:20,711 --> 00:26:22,044
Yeah.

319
00:26:23,171 --> 00:26:25,673
Gus, you outdid yourself.

320
00:26:29,553 --> 00:26:32,346
-Let's go back to the football game.
-Kiss my ass.

321
00:26:32,431 --> 00:26:36,726
-It’s halftime, man. This is some good shit.
-I’m about to nail his ass, right here.

322
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,769
Oh, Gussy, go back
to the Rabinowitz tape again.

323
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:40,313
Hold on. Now here come the good part.

324
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:41,480
-Look at this.

325
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:45,109
-She about to take off her panties.
-Yeah. Come on, come on, come on.

326
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:48,279
- Gus?
- Yeah?

327
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:50,781
-It’s Miles Massey.
-Take a number.

328
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:53,784
It’s about a job tonight.
-God damn it!

329
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:57,246
Shit, did you see that?

330
00:27:13,347 --> 00:27:15,556
Here we are.

331
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:19,727
Ms. Rexroth. I am so delighted
you decided to come.

332
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:24,857
-l must admit, I was curious.
-Something to start. Some wine, perhaps?

333
00:27:26,526 --> 00:27:27,943
-Red?
-French.

334
00:27:28,028 --> 00:27:29,612
-Bordeaux?
-Chateau Margaux.

335
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:31,947
-'57?
-'59.

336
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:34,909
-'54.
-Mr. Massey.

337
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:36,243
Good, sir.

338
00:27:36,328 --> 00:27:37,620
Your husband had told me

339
00:27:37,704 --> 00:27:41,832
you were the most beautiful woman
that he'd ever met.

340
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:46,003
I didn't expect
the most beautiful woman I’d ever met.

341
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:49,965
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears,
your flattery.

342
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,635
"For where a heart is hard,
they make no battery."

343
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:59,308
"Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?"

344
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:03,979
Now you didn't ask me here to pick me up.
You could be disbarred for that.

345
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:06,315
Maybe I’m reckless.

346
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,234
What was your performance about
this afternoon?

347
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:09,735
What did your lawyer say?

348
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,989
Oh, Freddy thinks you're a buffoon.
He says you've been too successful.

349
00:28:14,074 --> 00:28:17,743
You're bored, complacent,
and you're on your way down.

350
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:19,870
-But you don't think so.
-How do you know?

351
00:28:19,955 --> 00:28:21,997
-Why would you be here?
-Why did you ask me?

352
00:28:22,082 --> 00:28:23,499
-Can't I be curious?
-About what?

353
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:26,043
-Do you ever answer questions?
-Do you?

354
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:28,671
I’ll have the tournedos of beef.
The lady will have the same. Thank you.

355
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:30,756
Thank you, sir.

356
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:33,134
I assume you're a carnivore.

357
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:36,053
Oh, Mr. Massey,
you have no idea.

358
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:38,889
Miles, please.

359
00:28:38,974 --> 00:28:41,392
Tell me more about yourself.

360
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:46,814
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything
that you need to know.

361
00:28:46,898 --> 00:28:50,401
You may think you're tough,
but I eat men like you for breakfast.

362
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:53,362
I’ve invested five good years
in my marriage to Rex,

363
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:56,574
and I’ve nailed his ass fair and square.

364
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:59,118
Now I’m going to have it stuffed, mounted,

365
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:01,954
and have my lady friends come over
and throw darts at it.

366
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:03,497
Man hater, huh?

367
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:07,668
People don't go on safaris
'cause they hate animals.

368
00:29:07,753 --> 00:29:10,629
So it's just for the hunt
with the trophy at the end?

369
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,923
No. Nothing so frivolous.

370
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:19,805
This divorce means money.
Money means independence.

371
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,391
That's what I’m after.

372
00:29:22,476 --> 00:29:24,685
What are you after, Miles?

373
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:28,898
I’m a lot like you.
Just looking for an ass to mount.

374
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,527
Well, don't look at mine.

375
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:47,583
Yeah. Two, three.

376
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,154
I got you. See this?

377
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:33,337
Yeah?

378
00:30:34,756 --> 00:30:40,010
I’ll just have a salad, please.
Baby field greens.

379
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:42,471
What did you call me?

380
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,892
No, I didn't call you anything.

381
00:30:46,977 --> 00:30:50,855
-You want a salad.
-Do you have a green salad?

382
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:55,025
-What the fuck color would it be?
-Why are we eating here?

383
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,902
What's his problem?

384
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,989
Just bring him an iceberg lettuce
and a mealy tomato wedge

385
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:02,241
smothered with French dressing.

386
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:03,367
And for you?

387
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:07,079
Ham sandwich on stale rye bread.
Lots of mayo, easy on the ham.

388
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:09,290
-Slaw cup?
-What the hell.

389
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:10,916
Hello, Marge.

390
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:13,711
-How are you, Gus?
-I’m all right.

391
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:18,090
Okay. Now, I minoxed her address book.

392
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:20,217
Don't call me anymore
for this penny-ante shit.

393
00:31:20,302 --> 00:31:24,805
-l shoot action. Me and the Ikegami, Jack.
-Thank you, Gus.

394
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,684
-And those Rottweilers were a menace, man.
-l told you she had dogs.

395
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,187
Yeah. But you didn't tell me
they had a hard-on for anus africanus.

396
00:31:32,272 --> 00:31:35,232
Gus. Did you see any evidence?

397
00:31:35,317 --> 00:31:40,404
Any "telltale signs" of indiscretion
on the part of Ms. Rexroth?

398
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:46,785
What are you talking about "telltale signs"?
Look, I see an ass, I nail it.

399
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,497
I don't sneak around sniffing the sheets.
God damn it, I’m Gus Petch!

400
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:54,919
-Couldn't you be disbarred for that?
-Oh, I don't think so.

401
00:31:55,003 --> 00:31:57,796
-Maybe if I’d had the patty melt.
-You had a guy break into her house

402
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:00,257
-and photograph her address book.
-No, Wrigley.

403
00:32:00,342 --> 00:32:04,094
I happened to let a man know
that I was interested in her address book.

404
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:05,137
That's not criminal.

405
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:07,973
I also happened to let him know
that I was taking her out to dinner.

406
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:13,020
That's not a crime either. No, I don't see
myself as culpable in any sense.

407
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:15,272
You, on the other hand, could be disbarred

408
00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:18,609
for developing and examining
these photos of her address book.

409
00:32:18,693 --> 00:32:22,029
But that doesn't really concern me.

410
00:32:22,113 --> 00:32:26,575
-Right. Who are you looking for?
-Tenzing Norgay.

411
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,579
Tenzing Norgay.
That's someone she slept with.

412
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:32,957
I doubt it. Tenzing Norgay was the Sherpa

413
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:35,042
that helped Edmund Hillary
climb Mount Everest.

414
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:37,252
And Marylyn knows him.

415
00:32:37,337 --> 00:32:40,923
No, you idiot. Not the Tenzing Norgay.
Her Tenzing Norgay.

416
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,009
I’m not sure that I actually follow that.

417
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:48,055
Few great accomplishments are achieved
single-handedly, Wrigley.

418
00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:50,182
Most have their Norgays.

419
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:54,103
Marylyn Rexroth is even now
climbing her Everest.

420
00:32:54,187 --> 00:32:55,396
I wanna find her Norgay.

421
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,982
But how do you determine
which of the people on here are...

422
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:00,609
-How do you spot a Norgay?
-Yeah.

423
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:02,820
You start with the people
with the funny names.

424
00:33:02,904 --> 00:33:04,071
Oh, yea, oh yea!

425
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:06,949
Family Court of the Fifth District
of Los Angeles County now in session.

426
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,743
The Honorable Marva Munson presiding.
All rise.

427
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:22,548
-Have you sat before her before?
-No. No, the judge sits first. Then we sit.

428
00:33:22,632 --> 00:33:25,759
-Well, have you sat after her before?
-"Sat after her before?"

429
00:33:25,844 --> 00:33:27,761
You mean,
"Have we argued before her before?"

430
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:31,015
The judge sits in judgment.
The counsel argues before the judge.

431
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,684
So have you argued before her before?

432
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:35,728
Before her before,
or before she sat before?

433
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:36,895
Before her before.

434
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,940
-l said, "Before her before."
-No, you said, "Before she sat before."

435
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:41,984
-l did at first, but...
-Look, don't argue.

436
00:33:42,068 --> 00:33:44,194
-I’m not.
-No, you don't argue. We argue.

437
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,612
-Counsel argues.
-You appear.

438
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:47,031
- The judge sits.
- Then you sit.

439
00:33:47,115 --> 00:33:49,283
Or you stand in contempt.
-And then we argue.

440
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:51,535
-The counsel argues.
-Which you've done before.

441
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:54,079
-Which we've done before.
-Ah.

442
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:55,289
But not before her.

443
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:00,669
Rex. Sit.

444
00:34:00,754 --> 00:34:02,588
There it is! I got it!

445
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:07,301
I’m gonna nail your ass.
I'm gonna nail your ass.

446
00:34:07,385 --> 00:34:09,803
I'm gonna nail your ass. Yeah!

447
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:12,473
-I'm gonna nail your ass.
It's a silly misunderstanding.

448
00:34:12,557 --> 00:34:14,892
Get that thing off me now!

449
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:16,518
Yeah, I’m gonna nail your ass.

450
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:20,939
I'm gonna nail your ass.
I'm gonna nail your ass.

451
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:34,995
Devastated. Simply devastated.

452
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:38,290
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.

453
00:34:41,086 --> 00:34:43,128
Mr. Massey, any questions?

454
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:17,454
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears,
your flattery.

455
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:20,332
"For where a heart is hard,
they make no battery."

456
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:23,252
-Mrs. Rexroth, do you know those lines?
-Objection, Your Honor.

457
00:35:23,336 --> 00:35:27,005
-Grounds?
-Poetry recitation.

458
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:33,804
Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth,
how high is that wall around your heart?

459
00:35:33,888 --> 00:35:39,143
Your Honor, this is harassment,
and frankly, it's still a little arty-farty.

460
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:41,436
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth,
have you ever been in love?

461
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:43,564
Yes. Of course.

462
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:47,442
With Rex.

463
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:49,069
And you've always loved him?

464
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:53,157
"Whoever loved
that loved not at first sight?"

465
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:03,000
So it's your sworn testimony
that you have loved Rex Rexroth

466
00:36:03,084 --> 00:36:04,877
since first you met?

467
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:08,922
Yes.

468
00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:12,843
Thank you.

469
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:16,346
No further questions, Your Honor.

470
00:36:16,431 --> 00:36:19,349
- Who's next, Mr. Bender?
- We rest, Your Honor.

471
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,059
Mr. Massey.

472
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:24,271
Your Honor,
I call Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy.

473
00:36:25,106 --> 00:36:33,405
Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy.

474
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:35,741
Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy!
-Problem?

475
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:36,825
Puffy.

476
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,120
Heinz, the Baron Krauss von Espy!
-Tenzing Norgay.

477
00:37:02,393 --> 00:37:06,230
-Mr. Krauss, do you solemnly swear that...
-Krauss von Espy.

478
00:37:06,314 --> 00:37:10,192
-Mr. Krauss von Espy, do you solemnly...
-Baron Krauss von Espy.

479
00:37:10,276 --> 00:37:11,693
Solemnly swear that the testimony
you are about to give

480
00:37:11,778 --> 00:37:12,903
shall be the truth, the whole truth

481
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:14,029
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

482
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,281
No maybes.

483
00:37:17,825 --> 00:37:18,909
But of course, yes.

484
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:22,454
-The Baron does not lie.
Have a seat, sir.

485
00:37:23,122 --> 00:37:25,540
-Did you sleep with him?
-Don't be a fool.

486
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:28,085
Elsbieta.

487
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:33,966
Baron von Espy, what is your profession?

488
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,802
Silly man. I am a baron.

489
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:42,099
Yes, but do you not also hold a day job,
paying job, a square job?

490
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:44,268
Well, one has to live.

491
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:47,437
I am the concierge of Les Pantaloons Rouges

492
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:50,691
at Bad-Gadesbourg in the canton of Uri.

493
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:53,277
And what does that job entail?

494
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:56,613
I satisfy such requests
as the clientele may present.

495
00:37:56,698 --> 00:37:58,615
Towels, ice, et cetera?

496
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,742
We have bellmen for that. No, no, no.

497
00:38:00,827 --> 00:38:05,289
Such requests that, were you at home,
you would address not to your valet,

498
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:07,207
-but to your majordomo.

499
00:38:08,751 --> 00:38:11,586
I see. Baron, do you recognize that woman?

500
00:38:12,297 --> 00:38:14,548
Chere Marylyn. But of course.

501
00:38:14,632 --> 00:38:16,967
Look who is here. Hi!

502
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:22,806
And she was a guest of the Red Trousers?

503
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:28,729
Oh, many times
for relaxing and making Alpine recreation.

504
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:35,485
I am curious about her visit
of five years ago. January, 1 998.

505
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:39,614
Can you remember any specific request
she made at that time?

506
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:41,116
Yes, I can.

507
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,328
And what, at that time,
did she tell you she required?

508
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:49,249
She said that she required a husband!

509
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:55,255
Do you want some bones, huh?
Does Elsbieta want some bones?

510
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,215
Has anyone any bones?

511
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,178
Does anyone have any bones? Bones?
Dog candies?

512
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:05,307
No, they are not candies. Milk-Bones.
Hard, crunchy bones for the teeth.

513
00:39:05,391 --> 00:39:06,391
Hard...

514
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:10,520
We'll attend to the dog later.

515
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:13,398
Now, Baron... Where were we?

516
00:39:17,737 --> 00:39:19,696
"She said that she required a husband.

517
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:23,075
"Do you want some bones?
Does Elsbieta want some bones?

518
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:25,702
"Has anyone any bones?
Hard, crunchy bones for the..."

519
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:26,953
Right.

520
00:39:27,038 --> 00:39:31,583
Now, a husband. That's an unusual request.

521
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:34,378
Did she specify what kind of a husband
she was looking for?

522
00:39:34,462 --> 00:39:36,004
Stop him.
-Objection.

523
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:39,383
-Grounds?
-Hearsay.

524
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:40,550
It’s not secondhand, Your Honor.

525
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:43,428
This is direct testimony
about the Baron's own conversation.

526
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:44,846
I’m going to allow it.

527
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:49,518
She said she wanted a very rich husband.

528
00:39:49,602 --> 00:39:55,190
She wanted to know the businesses
and the wealths-es... The wealths-es.

529
00:39:55,274 --> 00:40:00,070
Can I say this?
Wealths-es of our various eligible guests.

530
00:40:00,154 --> 00:40:02,489
And did she have any other specifications?

531
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:05,951
-Objection, Your Honor. inflammatory.
-What's good for the gander, Your Honor.

532
00:40:06,035 --> 00:40:08,245
Is this a legal argument.
"What's good for the gander"?

533
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:09,413
You got to play your tape, Freddy.

534
00:40:09,497 --> 00:40:12,374
Mr. Massey has a point there.
I’m going to allow it.

535
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:15,043
Were there any other specifications?

536
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:18,088
She specificated a silly man.

537
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:20,549
- Objection, Your Honor!
- I’m going to allow it.

538
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:24,261
She specificated a man
who, though clever at making money,

539
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:26,972
would be easily duped and controlled.

540
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:29,266
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Shut up, Freddy. She's allowing it.

541
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:33,103
She specificated a man
with a wandering pee-pee.

542
00:40:33,187 --> 00:40:37,607
How you say? A philanderer whose affairs
would be transparent to the world.

543
00:40:37,692 --> 00:40:38,692
Objection, Your Honor!

544
00:40:38,776 --> 00:40:43,447
Finally, a man whom
she could herself brazenly cuckold

545
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:45,991
until such time as she might choose to...

546
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:48,660
We would say,
"Faire un coup de marteau sur des fesses."

547
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:51,663
You would say,
"Make hammer on his fanny."

548
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:55,292
-Your Honor, objection! Irrelevant!
-I’m going to allow it!

549
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:58,295
Tell us, Baron,
did you introduce her to such a man?

550
00:40:58,379 --> 00:41:00,547
Sir, I am the concierge!

551
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:03,300
And to whom did you introduce
that calculating woman?

552
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:07,387
I introduced her to that silly man.

553
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:10,056
Your Honor, objection!

554
00:41:10,141 --> 00:41:14,144
Let the record show that the Baron
has identified Rex Rexroth as the silly man!

555
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:18,523
I did it! It was I!
I introduced her to that silly man!

556
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:19,691
You son of a bitch!

557
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:22,569
The red-faced angry one.
I introduced them!

558
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:26,114
Absolutely! I did it! It was I!

559
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,993
-l just love trains! I love trains!
-lf you please, sir!

560
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,414
I’m not sick! You're the one who's sick!

561
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,585
lf you please, sir, not the larynx!

562
00:41:38,669 --> 00:41:41,129
Objection, Your Honor!
Strangling the witness!

563
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:43,089
I’m going to allow it.

564
00:41:45,843 --> 00:41:49,679
Well, I think it stinks.
They left you with nothing.

565
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:52,682
Makes you wonder
about the entire legal system,

566
00:41:52,767 --> 00:41:55,143
like Rodney what's-his-name.

567
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:57,103
They bought Massey's argument.

568
00:41:57,188 --> 00:42:00,023
lf I lied and cheated
and was with Rex only for his money,

569
00:42:00,107 --> 00:42:01,525
then he shouldn't have to give me any.

570
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:05,195
Well, that makes no sense.
Why else would you put in all those years?

571
00:42:07,114 --> 00:42:10,534
- Are you all right, Sarah?
- Yeah.

572
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:14,204
- What is it?
- Peptic ulcer.

573
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:18,333
I have medication, but I can't take it
before elective surgery.

574
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:24,506
-You shouldn't be living here alone, Sarah.
-My goddamn husbands gave me the ulcer.

575
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,467
But a bottle of Bromo can't love you back.

576
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:31,221
Yeah. It’s a catch-22.

577
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:37,143
I have to admit, I don't like living alone.
I mean, do I need 46 rooms?

578
00:42:37,228 --> 00:42:40,730
-You could see people.
-It’s risky. Palimony.

579
00:42:40,815 --> 00:42:44,025
Son of a bitch Marvin Mitchelson.

580
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:49,072
I’m telling you, honey, getting laid
is financial Russian roulette.

581
00:42:49,156 --> 00:42:53,577
Maybe I should just tear it all down,
build a cottage.

582
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:55,537
More landscaping.

583
00:42:58,207 --> 00:43:02,752
Well, with my money,
I can't afford to be fooling around.

584
00:43:02,837 --> 00:43:05,755
And besides, I have you.
It'll be fun, just the girls.

585
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,010
Well, thanks, Sarah,
but I can't sleep on your couch forever.

586
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:15,557
I’m going to marry again,
nail the guy's ass good.

587
00:43:17,059 --> 00:43:20,353
And this time, there'll be no Puffy von Espy.

588
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:37,329
Knock, knock.
Excuse me. Mr. Donaly?

589
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,998
-Mr. Donaly?

590
00:43:40,082 --> 00:43:41,958
Mr. Donaly, excuse me.

591
00:43:43,544 --> 00:43:46,504
-You are Donovan Donaly?
-I’m in a meeting.

592
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:49,507
Mr. Donaly. I need a name.

593
00:43:55,097 --> 00:43:58,933
And of course, we will have to litigate.
Sentence, paragraph.

594
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:05,357
Naturally, the first concern for both parties
is the welfare of little Wendell Junior.

595
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:08,985
Nevertheless, we do question
whether the continuing expenses

596
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,613
for his special ed classes are truly justified,
given the great strides...

597
00:44:12,782 --> 00:44:16,368
Mr. Massey,
the senior partner would like to see you.

598
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:20,372
-Herb wants to see me?
-If you have a moment.

599
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,822
Oh!

600
00:44:54,365 --> 00:44:57,784
Fourteen summary judgments sought.

601
00:44:58,911 --> 00:45:00,161
Thirteen granted.

602
00:45:02,456 --> 00:45:07,043
Eighteen movements to void
for respondent's prejudice.

603
00:45:07,128 --> 00:45:08,878
Eighteen granted.

604
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:12,924
Twelve court days
on the Rexroth case alone.

605
00:45:14,468 --> 00:45:19,389
Three hundred and twenty
billable hours paralegal services.

606
00:45:21,976 --> 00:45:26,271
Six hundred and eighty billable
at full attorney rate.

607
00:45:29,275 --> 00:45:31,860
Eighty-five lunches charged.

608
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:52,589
-Counselor,

609
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:58,636
you are the engine that drives this firm.

610
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,355
Mr. Massey?

611
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,901
Please, no calls. I’m feeling a little fragile.

612
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:15,528
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey,
but I felt certain you'd want to know.

613
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:17,155
Marylyn Rexroth wants to see you.

614
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,116
Marylyn. When did she...

615
00:46:20,201 --> 00:46:21,951
She's here now.

616
00:46:22,036 --> 00:46:25,121
Is she armed? Give me a minute.

617
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:39,385
Marylyn. How nice of you to...

618
00:46:40,554 --> 00:46:43,765
Marylyn, shame on you.

619
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:47,894
Marylyn, what a lovely surprise.

620
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:52,982
Marylyn, what a...

621
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:56,903
-Who the hell are you?
-Hello, Miles. So nice of you to see us.

622
00:47:00,241 --> 00:47:03,535
May I introduce Howard D. Doyle
of Doyle Oil.

623
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,537
I’m goddamn pleased to meet you.

624
00:47:05,621 --> 00:47:08,081
Marylyn here, she says you're the best.
Says you're aces.

625
00:47:08,165 --> 00:47:10,834
Well, thank you, Mr...

626
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:15,421
Any relation to John D. Doyle of Doyle Oil?

627
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:18,842
Oh, you must be talking about Grandpa John.
My papa's John D., too.

628
00:47:18,926 --> 00:47:21,511
The Deuce, we called him.
You know, kind of the rebel of the family.

629
00:47:21,595 --> 00:47:23,555
But they knocked off
that whole John D. routine

630
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,306
when they christened
little old yours truly here.

631
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:27,517
Grandpa nearly had a stroke.

632
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:30,395
He did have a stroke, but that was later,
during the labor activity in '52.

633
00:47:30,479 --> 00:47:33,982
The government stepped in.
They called it mediation.

634
00:47:34,066 --> 00:47:38,027
He called it incipient communism, you know,
and of course, that's when he had his stroke.

635
00:47:38,112 --> 00:47:41,364
Golly, the whole left side of his body
is as useless as tits on a boar hog.

636
00:47:41,448 --> 00:47:44,701
-He lingered in a vegetative state for years.
-Well, that is fascinating, Mr. Doyle.

637
00:47:44,785 --> 00:47:46,661
-What say we have a seat?
-A seat?

638
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:50,206
Here Marylyn’s had me runnin'
up and down Rodeo Drive all day long.

639
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:52,959
Kind of hit-and-run shoppin', you know.
Take no prisoners.

640
00:47:53,043 --> 00:47:56,129
Forced march kind of thing.
My God, my dogs are barkin'.

641
00:47:56,213 --> 00:47:57,839
We started out at this little old place

642
00:47:57,923 --> 00:47:59,549
-right off of Wilshire...
-It’s been quite a day.

643
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:00,842
-Had pewter things.
-But anyway, Miles,

644
00:48:00,926 --> 00:48:06,681
I know you're busy, and you charge
by the hour, so I’ll get straight to the point.

645
00:48:06,765 --> 00:48:09,684
Howard D. and I are planning to marry.

646
00:48:13,564 --> 00:48:14,772
Well...

647
00:48:15,649 --> 00:48:18,067
Well, I suppose that congratulations
are in order.

648
00:48:18,152 --> 00:48:20,403
Well, thank you, Miles.
You know, the urge to wedlock

649
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:24,824
and form a lasting monogamous bond
sanctified by ritual, it's pert-near universal.

650
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:28,411
As a matter of fact, it might be of some
interest to you, being in a related business.

651
00:48:28,495 --> 00:48:31,372
Even your indigenous Americans,
I believe it was your Cree, used to...

652
00:48:31,457 --> 00:48:35,668
Howard and I are here because
I’ve learned through bitter experience

653
00:48:35,753 --> 00:48:40,214
that when it comes to matrimony and law,
you are the very best.

654
00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:43,927
And as you are well aware,
my previous marriage

655
00:48:44,011 --> 00:48:48,556
ended in an unjustified stain
upon my reputation.

656
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:54,062
My motives were impugned.
I was slandered in court.

657
00:48:54,146 --> 00:48:56,731
I was painted a harlot.

658
00:48:57,524 --> 00:49:00,401
-Oh, honey, you ain't no harlot.
-Oh, yes, honey.

659
00:49:00,486 --> 00:49:04,906
So it's my desire
to remove any trace of suspicion

660
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,952
from the mind of my dear Howard Doyle.

661
00:49:09,036 --> 00:49:10,787
Oh, honey, come on, now.

662
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:12,956
I wish to execute a prenuptial agreement.

663
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,501
And I’m dead-set against it.
I mean, just anti the whole deal.

664
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:20,338
Howard's lawyers prefer it. I insist upon it.

665
00:49:20,422 --> 00:49:24,258
Oh, damn lawyers. No offense to
the present company or anything, you know.

666
00:49:24,343 --> 00:49:29,097
Now, is it my understanding that the Massey
prenup has never been penetrated?

667
00:49:29,181 --> 00:49:30,431
That is correct.

668
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:34,310
Not to blow my own horn, but they devote
an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.

669
00:49:34,395 --> 00:49:36,479
They got a hell of a school up there.
Ain't no doubt about it.

670
00:49:36,563 --> 00:49:38,648
We donated that Doyle building up there
here a while back.

671
00:49:39,817 --> 00:49:43,194
Now, I myself went to Texas A&M.
I’m an Aggie.

672
00:49:43,278 --> 00:49:45,822
-Business?
-Tight end.

673
00:49:45,906 --> 00:49:48,700
And I had a fair amount of success
against the split-T defense.

674
00:49:48,784 --> 00:49:50,702
You see, when they line up
symmetrical thataway,

675
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:52,495
it allows me to buttonhook and, you know,

676
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:54,872
do a down-and-in, and up-and-out
and different things,

677
00:49:54,957 --> 00:49:59,127
post pattern every now and then.
Your tight ends don't generally run a post.

678
00:49:59,211 --> 00:50:01,004
But if the QB calls it, hell, I’m ready.

679
00:50:01,088 --> 00:50:02,380
Interrupt for a second?
-Yeah.

680
00:50:02,464 --> 00:50:07,301
I wanna make sure that you both understand
what it is you're asking.

681
00:50:07,386 --> 00:50:11,222
The Massey prenup provides that in
the event of a dissolution of the marriage,

682
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:13,057
for any reason,

683
00:50:13,142 --> 00:50:17,395
both parties will leave it with
what they brought in and earned during.

684
00:50:17,479 --> 00:50:20,898
No one can profit from the marriage.

685
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:23,568
The prenup protects the wealthier party.

686
00:50:23,652 --> 00:50:28,239
Without it, that party is exposed,
a sitting duck.

687
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:34,287
-Not a hell of a lot of romance in that.
-No, sir, there is not. No romance.

688
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:36,873
More to the point, no wriggle room.

689
00:50:36,957 --> 00:50:42,837
So are we sure that this is what we want?

690
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:46,549
Absolutely.

691
00:50:47,426 --> 00:50:51,012
It’s my gift to Howard
for his peace of mind.

692
00:50:52,139 --> 00:50:55,892
Whether or not he's worried
about it at this moment.

693
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:58,811
Oh, honey pie, do I look worried?

694
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:04,192
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle.

695
00:51:04,276 --> 00:51:07,445
Could I just borrow your charming fiancée
for a moment?

696
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:10,406
Well, okay. You gonna leave a deposit?

697
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:18,956
What are you up to?

698
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:23,669
Something you won't understand, Miles.
Howard and I are very much in love.

699
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:26,130
I don't know what you're thinking,
but I have to warn you,

700
00:51:26,215 --> 00:51:28,800
the Massey prenup
has never been penetrated.

701
00:51:28,884 --> 00:51:32,512
You sign the prenup,
you can't get his money.

702
00:51:32,596 --> 00:51:34,514
Thanks for the professional help.

703
00:51:34,598 --> 00:51:40,728
Marylyn, think of me for a moment,
not as an attorney but as a friend.

704
00:51:40,813 --> 00:51:43,606
Does that mean you won't be
charging us for the hour?

705
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,651
Dump him. You can't nail his ass.

706
00:51:49,279 --> 00:51:50,404
Is that all?

707
00:51:52,366 --> 00:51:54,075
No, that's not all.

708
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:14,804
I could have you disbarred for that.

709
00:52:14,888 --> 00:52:16,389
It was worth it.

710
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:20,893
A romantic divorce attorney.

711
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:28,734
You fascinate me.

712
00:52:36,743 --> 00:52:40,580
I’ll get right on it.
I’ll whip something up.

713
00:52:40,664 --> 00:52:42,456
All right. Thank you.

714
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:46,586
-How's Lionel?
He's fine.

715
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:51,716
He asked me to deliver the keynote address
at this year's convention in Vegas.

716
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,093
-That's quite an honor.
I suppose.

717
00:52:54,178 --> 00:52:57,096
-On top of a great victory.
-What was that?

718
00:52:57,181 --> 00:53:00,433
"What was that"? Rex Rexroth?

719
00:53:00,517 --> 00:53:04,103
He kept everything? You win?
No compromise? Isn't that what you wanted?

720
00:53:07,608 --> 00:53:10,902
Oh, good God, Miles.
What are you looking for?

721
00:53:12,112 --> 00:53:13,613
I don't know.

722
00:53:16,116 --> 00:53:17,533
Okay, I won.

723
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:21,287
What then?

724
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:24,040
How many cases has Herb Myerson won?

725
00:53:24,124 --> 00:53:26,375
The old man? More than anybody.
He's a legend.

726
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,003
And look at him. He's 87 years old.

727
00:53:29,087 --> 00:53:32,882
He's the first one into the office
in the morning. No home life.

728
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:34,717
Who needs a home
when you have a colostomy bag?

729
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:37,511
She can't really love this dope, can she?

730
00:53:37,596 --> 00:53:41,182
-Who? Who loves who?
-Marylyn Rexroth.

731
00:53:41,266 --> 00:53:45,144
She signed a prenup for an oil millionaire.

732
00:53:46,313 --> 00:53:49,523
A Massey prenup?

733
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:56,489
-Yeah.
-Well, then she is not after his money.

734
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:02,078
Only love is in mind if the Massey is signed.

735
00:54:13,382 --> 00:54:18,636
April, come she will

736
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:24,016
When streams are ripe
and swelled with rain

737
00:54:25,352 --> 00:54:28,854
May, she will stay

738
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:32,817
Resting in my arms again

739
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:46,998
What the hell's wrong with you?

740
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:52,378
April, come she will

741
00:54:58,051 --> 00:55:00,720
Thank you for coming to this celebration

742
00:55:00,804 --> 00:55:04,974
of the love between our two friends,
Marylyn and Howard.

743
00:55:05,058 --> 00:55:07,143
In today's cynical world,

744
00:55:07,227 --> 00:55:13,274
it's so hard to take that great leap of faith
aboard the ship of love and caring.

745
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,111
But today Marylyn and Howard
are taking that leap

746
00:55:17,195 --> 00:55:19,322
and telling us, their friends,

747
00:55:19,406 --> 00:55:24,285
that they do believe, that they do have faith,
that they do love.

748
00:55:25,162 --> 00:55:28,456
Do you, Howard Drexler Doyle, take Marylyn

749
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,292
to be your shipmate
on this journey through life,

750
00:55:31,376 --> 00:55:35,838
through gale and doldrum,
seas choppy, wild, and calm?

751
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:37,923
Yes, I do, Father Scott.

752
00:55:38,008 --> 00:55:42,636
And do you, Marylyn Rexroth, take Howard
to be your shipmate and companion

753
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:47,099
to ports of every clime,
be it in first class or steerage?

754
00:55:48,518 --> 00:55:49,769
I do.

755
00:55:49,853 --> 00:55:52,855
Then, by the power vested in me
by the State of California,

756
00:55:52,939 --> 00:55:55,649
and as captain
of the good ship Amore Veritas,

757
00:55:55,734 --> 00:55:58,194
I now pronounce you man and wife.

758
00:56:19,132 --> 00:56:20,883
What do you think?

759
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:24,220
What are they, ladles?
-Berry spoons.

760
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:25,721
-Spoons?
-Berry spoons.

761
00:56:25,806 --> 00:56:28,474
-Everybody has spoons.
-And nobody needs berry spoons.

762
00:56:28,558 --> 00:56:30,893
-Everybody eats berries.
-Who are you, Pollyanna?

763
00:56:30,977 --> 00:56:33,771
- Hey, everybody! Folks! Hey, y'all!
- Where'd you see them at?

764
00:56:33,855 --> 00:56:36,399
A Martha Stewart catalog
right next to the silver napkin rings?

765
00:56:36,483 --> 00:56:38,901
I need your attention for a minute.
-Stadium-seat ass-warmers?

766
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:42,154
Dear God, Wrigley, how many cockamamie
personal possessions do we have to amass?

767
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,280
Miles, why so angry?

768
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:45,491
Now, I know it's not common practice

769
00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:49,245
for the groom to give his bride a gift
on their wedding day.

770
00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:53,541
But ever since I met Marylyn there,
I can't seem to quit givin' her things.

771
00:56:55,419 --> 00:56:59,004
And I don't wanna stop
'cause it feels so darn good!

772
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:02,758
Chow Sing, bring that barbecue sauce
over here, little buddy.

773
00:57:02,843 --> 00:57:04,593
There you go.

774
00:57:04,678 --> 00:57:07,680
Put that thing on my neck now.

775
00:57:07,764 --> 00:57:11,725
Now, honey, it's like the padre said.
I want love and trust between us.

776
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,437
Love, and trust, and not a thing else.

777
00:57:14,521 --> 00:57:17,606
And this here deed that I’m fixin' to perform.

778
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:22,862
Well, honey, let me just...

779
00:57:26,032 --> 00:57:27,491
You see this?

780
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:40,421
This is for you, darling. This here is for you.

781
00:57:41,882 --> 00:57:46,552
This here is for you, baby.
Every last little speck of it.

782
00:57:46,636 --> 00:57:51,432
I love you.
I mean, I love you like a son of a bitch!

783
00:57:53,393 --> 00:57:56,228
I trust you!

784
00:57:56,313 --> 00:57:58,814
-This here is for you, baby.
-Brilliant!

785
00:57:58,899 --> 00:58:00,649
Baby, this is for you.

786
00:58:00,734 --> 00:58:02,693
-What is it?
I really love you.

787
00:58:02,777 --> 00:58:04,528
It’s the prenup.

788
00:58:05,238 --> 00:58:09,116
I love her! I trust her!

789
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:10,910
-Ladies and gentlemen...
-It’s the prenup!

790
00:58:10,994 --> 00:58:13,871
- I trust her!
- Brilliant!

791
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:19,460
You look so beautiful.

792
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:23,839
Ladies, if you'll excuse us. We have to talk.

793
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:29,678
I would like to offer my congratulations.
It was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.

794
00:58:29,763 --> 00:58:34,725
Well, Howard is a beautiful person.
A diamond in the rough.

795
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:37,061
And I have a feeling that someday soon,

796
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:40,356
you'll be taking that diamond
and leaving the rough.

797
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,527
In a month or so, once I’ve established
that I’ve tried to make the marriage work.

798
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:48,030
-May I offer my services?
-Oh, thanks.

799
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:52,159
But, no. No, I’m retaining Freddy Bender.

800
00:58:52,244 --> 00:58:54,995
Poor Freddy.
He was awfully blue after my last divorce.

801
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,747
Well, I admire your loyalty.

802
00:58:56,831 --> 00:58:58,874
To lawyers, anyway.

803
00:58:58,959 --> 00:59:02,086
I guess without the prenup, it's something
that even Freddy could manage.

804
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:07,049
But how did you get Howard to do it?
It felt like it was his idea.

805
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:09,885
Surely, Mr. Massey,
you've addressed enough juries

806
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:12,846
to appreciate the power of suggestion.

807
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:21,272
Look, now that the marriage
is winding down,

808
00:59:22,232 --> 00:59:24,900
have dinner with me.

809
00:59:24,985 --> 00:59:30,322
No. No, nothing doing until
the ink is dry on the settlement.

810
00:59:30,407 --> 00:59:34,451
Oh, this'll be no settlement.
lf I know Marylyn Rexroth,

811
00:59:34,536 --> 00:59:40,040
this'll be nothing short
of a complete and total annihilation.

812
00:59:59,102 --> 01:00:01,604
-You're gonna win.
-Excuse me?

813
01:00:01,688 --> 01:00:05,357
I can always tell, going to Vegas,
who's gonna win.

814
01:00:05,442 --> 01:00:08,235
Well, thanks, but I’m going on business.

815
01:00:09,237 --> 01:00:10,696
I always win.

816
01:00:26,963 --> 01:00:29,965
You know why I hate this town, Wrigley?
You see, people get to Las Vegas,

817
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,968
and all of a sudden,
the rules of the moral universe don't apply.

818
01:00:33,053 --> 01:00:35,512
When God is dead, all things are possible.

819
01:00:35,597 --> 01:00:37,473
I saw an ad in the paper,

820
01:00:37,557 --> 01:00:42,770
"No-fault divorce.
Two-week divorce without a lawyer."

821
01:00:42,854 --> 01:00:46,148
Made me sick to my stomach.
"No-fault divorce."

822
01:00:46,232 --> 01:00:49,526
Good God. Talk about your oxymoron.

823
01:00:49,611 --> 01:00:52,363
-What's the world coming to?
-One man can only do so much.

824
01:00:52,447 --> 01:00:55,324
One man... What are you talking about?

825
01:00:55,408 --> 01:00:56,784
Freddy.

826
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:58,577
I had lunch with
Freddy Bender yesterday.

827
01:00:58,662 --> 01:01:02,039
He tells me that Marylyn Rexroth-Doyle
is now richer than Croesus.

828
01:01:02,123 --> 01:01:05,459
Ah, yes, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?

829
01:01:05,543 --> 01:01:08,629
She could buy and sell you 1 0 times over.

830
01:01:10,173 --> 01:01:12,007
My God, is that her?

831
01:01:13,593 --> 01:01:17,179
Freddy said she was flying in with him.
Celebrating, I guess.

832
01:01:17,263 --> 01:01:20,766
I’m fascinated by that creature.
Richer than me, huh?

833
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:25,437
Well, she deserves every penny.
And now she's single again.

834
01:01:26,606 --> 01:01:28,357
Excuse me.

835
01:01:28,441 --> 01:01:30,776
No, you should stay away from her, Miles.

836
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,278
Recite your keynote address.
Take a cold shower.

837
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:44,748
-You're looking well, Marylyn.
-Hello, Miles.

838
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:48,210
Obscene wealth becomes you.

839
01:01:48,294 --> 01:01:51,714
-l should've known you'd be here.
-Be here?

840
01:01:51,798 --> 01:01:54,675
-I’m the keynote speaker.
-How nice for you.

841
01:01:54,759 --> 01:01:57,886
-"Nailing Your Spouse's Assets."
-Excuse me?

842
01:01:57,971 --> 01:01:59,430
My speech.

843
01:01:59,514 --> 01:02:00,681
Oh!

844
01:02:02,308 --> 01:02:06,311
-Oh, I’m sure you'll bring the house down.
-It’s an easy crowd.

845
01:02:06,396 --> 01:02:09,398
At this point, I would think
you're probably the only person

846
01:02:09,482 --> 01:02:12,359
-that I can't teach anything to.
-Really?

847
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:18,115
Now, correct me,
but since by now the ink must be dry,

848
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:21,618
-l believe I have the right to collect.
-On?

849
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:24,955
You promised to have dinner with me
once you were free.

850
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,126
I said I wouldn't whilst I wasn't,
which implies no promise once I am.

851
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,795
Noted. Let me rephrase.

852
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,341
I would be delighted, honored really,
if you'd...

853
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:39,845
-Howard!
-Howard!

854
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:41,305
Howard!

855
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:46,727
-You named him after your ex.
-I’m sentimental.

856
01:02:46,811 --> 01:02:52,858
Well, I’m free this evening, so I suppose
a little dinner would do no harm.

857
01:02:52,942 --> 01:02:56,195
Le Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin 1990, sir.

858
01:02:56,279 --> 01:02:59,823
Yes. Thank you. I’ll take care of it.

859
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:05,204
Marylyn, this is a moment to savor.

860
01:03:05,872 --> 01:03:10,626
Yes, we were adversaries,
but we were also professionals.

861
01:03:12,212 --> 01:03:16,632
So let us raise a glass to friendship.

862
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:20,803
To victory.

863
01:03:25,892 --> 01:03:29,228
So how does it feel?

864
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:33,440
-Sorry?
-Victory. Independence.

865
01:03:33,817 --> 01:03:34,983
Oh.

866
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:41,907
-Well, frankly, Miles...
-It’s not everything you'd hoped for?

867
01:03:46,496 --> 01:03:47,871
I know the feeling.

868
01:03:49,332 --> 01:03:52,626
Independence. Two-edged sword.

869
01:03:54,671 --> 01:03:57,589
My friend... My best friend, Sarah Sorkin.

870
01:03:59,259 --> 01:04:02,302
Sarah Battista-O'Flanagan-Sorkin?

871
01:04:02,387 --> 01:04:05,097
The O'Flanagan settlement?

872
01:04:07,642 --> 01:04:09,101
-Ah.
-Hmm.

873
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:13,689
Anyway, three fine settlements.

874
01:04:13,773 --> 01:04:16,149
More money than she could ever hope to spend.

875
01:04:16,234 --> 01:04:18,443
-Yes.
-Her vaunted independence.

876
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:21,196
Don't tell me. She sits around the house,

877
01:04:21,281 --> 01:04:23,991
afraid to see people,
afraid to put her portfolio into play.

878
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:28,453
And only a peptic ulcer
to keep her warm at night.

879
01:04:28,538 --> 01:04:29,621
Yes.

880
01:04:31,291 --> 01:04:35,419
There's a certain point
when you've achieved your goals.

881
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:39,464
You realize that you're still not satisfied.

882
01:04:39,549 --> 01:04:40,632
Yes.

883
01:04:48,892 --> 01:04:49,933
We should order.

884
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,647
You know, I’m not really hungry.

885
01:04:56,482 --> 01:04:57,983
Neither am l.

886
01:05:41,361 --> 01:05:44,738
Eighteen hundred billable hours.

887
01:05:44,822 --> 01:05:48,867
Twelve hundred twenty-one motions to void.

888
01:05:50,536 --> 01:05:54,790
Five hundred and sixty-four
summary judgments.

889
01:05:56,209 --> 01:05:58,961
A hundred and twenty-nine thousand

890
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:03,090
nine hundred and ninety-nine
lunches charged.

891
01:06:20,692 --> 01:06:24,069
- Hello?
- Miles?

892
01:06:24,153 --> 01:06:26,363
Hello? Marylyn?

893
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:28,949
Sarah Sorkin just died!

894
01:06:31,703 --> 01:06:34,496
-Marylyn!
-Her ulcer.

895
01:06:36,874 --> 01:06:41,211
-Perforated. Infection.
-Yes.

896
01:06:43,381 --> 01:06:47,426
-Miles?
-Yes, Marylyn?

897
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,886
She was alone.

898
01:06:49,971 --> 01:06:54,975
She'd been dead for two days
before her Pilates instructor found her.

899
01:06:57,979 --> 01:07:02,190
Marylyn, listen to me. No arguments.
No discussions.

900
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:04,401
I’ll have Wrigley meet us
at the Wee Kirk o' the Heather.

901
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:11,241
Wrigley!

902
01:07:11,325 --> 01:07:13,160
The vows are from
an Arapaho dawn-greeting ceremony.

903
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:17,456
The music is Simon & Garfunkel.
And this is the Massey prenup.

904
01:07:18,124 --> 01:07:22,002
-You the two getting married?
-Mr. MacKinnon here will be officiating.

905
01:07:22,086 --> 01:07:24,463
-Sorry. Short notice.
-Pen.

906
01:07:24,547 --> 01:07:28,008
Marylyn, you're welcome to examine this.

907
01:07:28,092 --> 01:07:31,762
This is the Massey prenup.

908
01:07:31,846 --> 01:07:34,806
-As you know, it's ironclad.
-We tried to reach Freddy Bender.

909
01:07:34,891 --> 01:07:37,100
We tried to reach Freddy Bender
to have him here for your protection,

910
01:07:37,185 --> 01:07:39,311
-but we couldn't find him.
-I couldn't get him.

911
01:07:39,395 --> 01:07:41,271
Are you two here to get married
or to bullshit?

912
01:07:41,355 --> 01:07:44,149
So you can't hope
to benefit from the marriage?

913
01:07:44,233 --> 01:07:45,734
Not in any way.

914
01:07:45,818 --> 01:07:49,112
And my wealth is completely,
completely protected?

915
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:52,491
As if a lead veil had been drawn across it.

916
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:04,252
-Do you still want to marry me?
-More than ever.

917
01:08:07,507 --> 01:08:09,508
Are you renting kilts?

918
01:08:27,485 --> 01:08:30,695
Do you, Miles Longfellow Massey

919
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:35,200
of Massey, Myerson, Sloan and Gurolnick, LLP,

920
01:08:35,284 --> 01:08:40,705
take Marylyn Hamilton-Rexroth-Doyle
to be your lawful wedded wife?

921
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:42,749
I do. Yes. I do. I do.

922
01:08:42,834 --> 01:08:47,212
Let me finish.
Jesus, have you never been married before?

923
01:08:48,089 --> 01:08:52,384
To have and to hold, to love and to cherish,
till death do you part?

924
01:08:55,721 --> 01:08:56,972
I do.

925
01:08:57,056 --> 01:09:01,143
And do you,
Marylyn Hamilton-Rexroth-Doyle,

926
01:09:01,227 --> 01:09:05,147
take Miles Longfellow Massey
to be your lawful wedded husband,

927
01:09:05,231 --> 01:09:10,360
to have and to hold, to love and to cherish,
till death do you part?

928
01:09:10,444 --> 01:09:14,197
-l do.
-l now pronounce you man and wife.

929
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:49,441
I’ll take care of you later.

930
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:03,371
No, no, no, no, no. No. This is all wrong.

931
01:10:06,626 --> 01:10:07,792
Is it the kilt?

932
01:10:08,628 --> 01:10:11,880
-Do you love me?
-More than anything.

933
01:10:13,925 --> 01:10:17,594
-Can I trust you?
-Yes, you can trust me.

934
01:10:26,938 --> 01:10:28,313
Darling, you're exposed.

935
01:10:29,523 --> 01:10:30,774
A sitting duck.

936
01:10:49,168 --> 01:10:51,002
I hereby declare the 12th Congress

937
01:10:51,087 --> 01:10:56,633
of the National Organization
of Matrimonial Attorneys Nationwide open.

938
01:10:56,717 --> 01:10:58,426
As our first order of business,

939
01:10:58,511 --> 01:11:02,305
it is a privileged
to call to the podium our keynote speaker.

940
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:07,185
From the Los Angeles firm
of Massey, Myerson, Sloan and Gurolnick,

941
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:12,941
a man whose name is synonymous
with bitter disputes and big awards,

942
01:11:13,025 --> 01:11:14,234
Miles Massey.

943
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:34,212
Thank you, Branco.

944
01:11:38,884 --> 01:11:40,552
In the world of...

945
01:11:44,348 --> 01:11:47,392
In the world of matrimonial law, there are...

946
01:11:55,484 --> 01:11:59,321
In the world of matrimonial law,
there are multiple tactics.

947
01:12:16,756 --> 01:12:18,089
Friends,

948
01:12:21,093 --> 01:12:24,095
this morning I stand before you
a very different Miles Massey

949
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:26,765
than the one that addressed you last year

950
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:30,643
on the disposition of marital assets
following murder/suicide.

951
01:12:30,728 --> 01:12:34,773
I wish to talk to you today
not about technical matters of law.

952
01:12:36,817 --> 01:12:40,195
I wish to talk to you
about something more important.

953
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,575
I wish to talk to you from the heart.

954
01:12:51,123 --> 01:12:55,710
Because today, for the first time in my life,

955
01:12:57,088 --> 01:13:00,423
I stand before you naked,

956
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,096
vulnerable,

957
01:13:11,143 --> 01:13:13,061
and in love.

958
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:21,403
Love.

959
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:25,990
It's a word we matrimonial lawyers avoid.

960
01:13:27,368 --> 01:13:29,911
Funny, isn't it?
We're frightened of this emotion,

961
01:13:29,995 --> 01:13:34,416
which is, in a sense,
the seed of our livelihood.

962
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:41,131
Well, today Miles Massey is here to tell you
that love need cause us no fear.

963
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:48,263
Love need cause us no shame. Love is...

964
01:13:50,182 --> 01:13:51,266
Good.

965
01:13:57,189 --> 01:13:58,314
Love is good.

966
01:14:03,446 --> 01:14:04,821
Now I am, of course, aware

967
01:14:04,905 --> 01:14:08,700
that these remarks
will be received here with cynicism.

968
01:14:09,702 --> 01:14:13,246
Cynicism, that cloak
that advertises our indifference

969
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:15,540
and hides all human feeling.

970
01:14:15,624 --> 01:14:19,085
Well, I'm here to tell you that that cynicism
which we think protects us,

971
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,880
in fact, destroys.

972
01:14:21,964 --> 01:14:27,677
Destroys love, destroys our clients,
and, ultimately, destroys ourselves.

973
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:33,433
Colleagues, when our clients come to us
confused and angry and hurting

974
01:14:33,517 --> 01:14:37,187
because their flame of love is guttering
and threatens to die,

975
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:39,564
do we seek to extinguish that flame

976
01:14:39,648 --> 01:14:43,485
so that we can sift through the smoldering
wreckage for our paltry reward?

977
01:14:43,569 --> 01:14:46,321
Or do we fan this precious flame,

978
01:14:46,405 --> 01:14:51,367
this most precious flame,
back into loving, roaring life?

979
01:14:51,452 --> 01:14:57,832
Do we counsel fear or trust?
Do we seek to destroy or build?

980
01:14:57,917 --> 01:15:02,420
Do we meet our clients' problems
with cynicism

981
01:15:04,465 --> 01:15:05,757
or with love?

982
01:15:11,597 --> 01:15:14,307
The choice is, of course, each of ours.

983
01:15:16,435 --> 01:15:21,105
For my part, I've made the leap of love,
and there's no going back.

984
01:15:21,941 --> 01:15:24,317
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the last time I will address you

985
01:15:24,401 --> 01:15:27,445
as the president of N.O.M.A.N.
or as a member.

986
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:35,870
I intend to devote myself
to pro bono work in East Los Angeles

987
01:15:35,955 --> 01:15:37,288
or one of those other...

988
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,587
God bless you all.

989
01:16:33,887 --> 01:16:35,513
I love you, man.

990
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:53,281
So, Wrigley, I’m gonna be relinquishing
my partnership in Massey Myerson.

991
01:16:53,365 --> 01:16:57,285
lf you care to join me in my new endeavor,
I’d be delighted.

992
01:16:57,369 --> 01:16:59,912
Of course, I can't offer you
the same kind of financial remuneration

993
01:16:59,997 --> 01:17:01,039
you've grown accustomed to,

994
01:17:01,123 --> 01:17:02,832
but the work will have to serve
as its own reward.

995
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:05,793
Barkeep, we'll have two
of your finest scotches.

996
01:17:05,878 --> 01:17:08,129
-That's the...
-l propose a toast.

997
01:17:08,213 --> 01:17:10,673
Barkeep!
-That's the soap that used to belong to...

998
01:17:10,758 --> 01:17:12,925
You'll be serving in a junior capacity,
of course.

999
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:14,510
Donovan Donaly.

1000
01:17:14,595 --> 01:17:16,971
Miles, that's...

1001
01:17:17,056 --> 01:17:19,015
It’ll be a small operation,
a boutique firm.

1002
01:17:19,099 --> 01:17:20,808
Let me tell you what they called me
in medical school.

1003
01:17:20,893 --> 01:17:23,061
In any firm,
there can be only one ramrod.

1004
01:17:23,145 --> 01:17:25,688
I don't see why my leadership skills should...

1005
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:27,899
Howard?
-Mackenzie the Mechanical Marvel.

1006
01:17:27,983 --> 01:17:30,068
It’s Howard.
-You see, I have no nerves.

1007
01:17:30,152 --> 01:17:33,738
He's not an oil tycoon. An actor.

1008
01:17:35,157 --> 01:17:37,325
Doctor, this is highly unusual.

1009
01:17:37,409 --> 01:17:40,787
So Marylyn married a soap actor.

1010
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:45,333
So she's... She's poor.

1011
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:48,836
Get yourself some clean scrubs,
and have them prepare the OR.

1012
01:17:48,921 --> 01:17:52,006
-Well, thank God you have the prenup.
-l have no prenup.

1013
01:17:52,091 --> 01:17:54,634
-You have no prenup.
-l have no prenup.

1014
01:17:54,718 --> 01:17:56,344
You have no prenup.

1015
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:07,939
Thanks.

1016
01:18:09,358 --> 01:18:11,109
Okay.

1017
01:18:15,948 --> 01:18:18,908
-Marylyn?
-Oh, hello, Miles.

1018
01:18:24,289 --> 01:18:26,165
-Going back to LA?
-Yes.

1019
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:31,713
Look, Miles, I think it's only fair
to warn you that after a decent interval,

1020
01:18:31,797 --> 01:18:34,382
I intend to have Freddy seek an injunction

1021
01:18:34,466 --> 01:18:37,760
that would forbid you to approach
within 500 feet of my house.

1022
01:18:37,845 --> 01:18:39,178
You mean my house.

1023
01:18:39,263 --> 01:18:43,015
Oh, I believe the residence
will be part of the settlement.

1024
01:18:45,561 --> 01:18:50,356
Marylyn, didn't last night
mean anything to you?

1025
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:54,986
Oh, well, about as much as it'll mean to you,
half of your net worth.

1026
01:18:56,488 --> 01:19:02,410
Miles, you'll always be my favorite husband.
But no more sentiment, darling.

1027
01:19:03,454 --> 01:19:05,496
I really have to be going.

1028
01:19:06,832 --> 01:19:08,666
The dog's rented.

1029
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,387
-You didn't win.
-Excuse me?

1030
01:19:21,472 --> 01:19:25,099
I can always tell, coming back from Vegas,
who didn't win.

1031
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:30,855
You're right.

1032
01:19:34,943 --> 01:19:40,406
But you're going through with it?

1033
01:19:40,491 --> 01:19:42,492
Yes.

1034
01:19:42,576 --> 01:19:46,287
I just felt so sorry for him for a minute there.

1035
01:19:46,371 --> 01:19:49,624
At the preliminary hearing,
he just looked so beaten.

1036
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:52,627
-Well, he was beaten fair and square.
-l know, but...

1037
01:19:52,711 --> 01:19:54,629
Oh, their pathetic look.

1038
01:19:54,713 --> 01:19:58,549
It’s what they all fall back on
when they don't have a prenup.

1039
01:20:01,845 --> 01:20:05,014
Just stay strong until the divorce is final.

1040
01:20:05,098 --> 01:20:08,392
Relax and enjoy your pool.

1041
01:20:13,524 --> 01:20:16,400
-Do you think he's eating enough?
-Marylyn!

1042
01:20:18,654 --> 01:20:20,738
This woman has humbled,

1043
01:20:22,449 --> 01:20:26,577
shamed, and disgraced the entire firm.

1044
01:20:27,579 --> 01:20:32,500
-Yes, Herb.
-Counselor, this firm deals in power.

1045
01:20:34,545 --> 01:20:37,046
This firm deals in perception.

1046
01:20:38,924 --> 01:20:42,927
This firm cannot prosper, nor long endure

1047
01:20:43,011 --> 01:20:49,600
if it is perceived to be dancing
to the music of a hurdy-gurdy!

1048
01:20:51,436 --> 01:20:52,854
It’s just...

1049
01:20:54,273 --> 01:20:59,110
Herb, for the first time in my career,
I don't know what to do.

1050
01:21:00,779 --> 01:21:05,366
I’m a patsy. I’m a sitting duck. I’m lost.

1051
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:07,118
Lost?

1052
01:21:07,202 --> 01:21:11,831
I’ll tell you what you can do.
You can act like a man.

1053
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:14,750
And let me tell you something, smart guy.

1054
01:21:14,835 --> 01:21:17,587
You thought you had it all figured out.

1055
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:24,218
Trust. Marriage.
All your goddamn love, love, love!

1056
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:29,891
Now, you listen to me. I’m gonna talk to you
about the goddamn law.

1057
01:21:29,975 --> 01:21:33,978
We serve the law! We honor the law!

1058
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:39,358
And sometimes, Counselor, we obey the law.

1059
01:21:40,068 --> 01:21:46,157
But, Counselor,
this is not one of those times.

1060
01:21:57,044 --> 01:22:00,463
Are you Wheezy Joe?

1061
01:22:01,048 --> 01:22:03,633
Which of you is Smith?

1062
01:22:03,717 --> 01:22:09,597
Well, we're here representing Mr. Smith
on a matter of some delicacy.

1063
01:22:09,681 --> 01:22:12,058
-Who's the pigeon?
-The what?

1064
01:22:12,142 --> 01:22:15,353
-Who you want me to kill?
-Yes. Well, we would like you...

1065
01:22:15,437 --> 01:22:19,941
Mr. Smith would like you to neutralize,

1066
01:22:20,025 --> 01:22:25,821
terminate, render unto a state of,
so that she isn't so much...

1067
01:22:26,615 --> 01:22:29,909
-Breathing.
-Yes. A business associate

1068
01:22:29,993 --> 01:22:33,871
by the name of Marylyn
Rexroth-Doyle-Massey... Smith-Massey.

1069
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:37,708
Is that one person?

1070
01:22:37,793 --> 01:22:42,588
I have some photos here of Miss Rexroth,

1071
01:22:42,673 --> 01:22:45,633
and that's the address that she's staying at.

1072
01:22:45,717 --> 01:22:48,719
That is Mr. Smith's address.
Massey's, Smith...

1073
01:22:48,804 --> 01:22:52,181
It’s Mr. Smith's address.
Although Mr. Smith is not directly involved.

1074
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:53,891
Because of
an impending legal matter,

1075
01:22:53,976 --> 01:22:56,310
we need this to happen
within a certain time frame.

1076
01:22:56,395 --> 01:22:59,897
-On an expedited basis.
-You're in a rush.

1077
01:22:59,982 --> 01:23:02,316
-We're not in a rush.
-Mr. Smith is.

1078
01:23:12,452 --> 01:23:15,246
She won't...
She won't suffer, will she?

1079
01:23:16,456 --> 01:23:18,457
Not unless you pay extra.

1080
01:23:20,836 --> 01:23:23,212
I've been workin' on the railroad

1081
01:23:23,296 --> 01:23:25,840
All the livelong day

1082
01:23:25,924 --> 01:23:28,384
I've been workin' on the railroad

1083
01:23:28,468 --> 01:23:31,679
Just to pass the time away

1084
01:23:31,763 --> 01:23:35,141
Can't you hear the whistle blowin'

1085
01:23:35,225 --> 01:23:37,476
Rise up early in the...

1086
01:23:40,772 --> 01:23:43,315
Whistles go "toot-toot."

1087
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:51,949
What's the matter, Rexie?

1088
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:00,332
Hello?

1089
01:24:02,961 --> 01:24:05,629
Yes, he's here. One moment, please.

1090
01:24:18,977 --> 01:24:20,144
Miles.

1091
01:24:21,605 --> 01:24:23,189
It’s for you.

1092
01:24:30,155 --> 01:24:33,574
Hello? Yes?

1093
01:24:43,293 --> 01:24:44,335
What?

1094
01:24:46,505 --> 01:24:48,130
I see.

1095
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:53,135
-My God.
-What?

1096
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:58,933
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.

1097
01:24:59,017 --> 01:25:02,394
Yes? What do you mean he was?

1098
01:25:03,188 --> 01:25:07,108
Rex had a massive coronary
in the middle of a business meeting.

1099
01:25:08,151 --> 01:25:09,276
He's dead.

1100
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,615
Well, I’m very sorry to hear that,
but you two weren't close, were you?

1101
01:25:14,699 --> 01:25:19,870
Marvin said that Rex's will
was four years old. Never redrafted it.

1102
01:25:20,455 --> 01:25:23,124
-He was stinking rich.
-Yes?

1103
01:25:26,128 --> 01:25:28,212
Everything goes to Marylyn.

1104
01:25:34,261 --> 01:25:36,595
She's not poor. She's richer than you.

1105
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,557
She is exposed. No prenup.
She's a sitting duck.

1106
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:41,976
She's a sitting duck. Can't kill her.
No need.

1107
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,311
-No. It would be pointless. She's exposed.
-It’s pointless.

1108
01:25:44,396 --> 01:25:47,314
Why kill the only woman you've
ever loved when she's the richer party?

1109
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:50,359
She's rich. And I love her.
Don't need to kill her.

1110
01:25:50,443 --> 01:25:51,986
-Ah!
-What, "Ah"?

1111
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:53,654
-You've reached Wheezy Joe.
-Joe!

1112
01:25:53,738 --> 01:25:55,197
What do you want?

1113
01:25:55,282 --> 01:25:58,200
Hi, it's Miles Smith...
Mr. Smith calling to say,

1114
01:25:58,285 --> 01:26:00,494
-on behalf of myself, that it is...
-No-go.

1115
01:26:00,579 --> 01:26:02,872
No-go concerning Marylyn.

1116
01:26:02,956 --> 01:26:06,417
I’m speaking with no knowledge.
This is what Mr. Smith wants.

1117
01:26:06,501 --> 01:26:08,169
This is what I want.

1118
01:26:08,253 --> 01:26:11,672
I am Mr. Smith. Thank you.

1119
01:26:14,759 --> 01:26:18,596
-That was good.
-You think I’m protected?

1120
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,223
-Am I protected?
-l think it would hold up.

1121
01:26:21,308 --> 01:26:23,142
-Marylyn.
-Yes, yes. Marylyn.

1122
01:26:23,226 --> 01:26:25,102
What do we do?
What if he's on his way there?

1123
01:26:25,187 --> 01:26:26,353
Yes. Oh!

1124
01:26:26,438 --> 01:26:29,815
-lf he's on his way there...
-Oh, no! Marylyn!

1125
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:33,736
Get her out and buy some time.
Buy some time!

1126
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:41,202
Hello?

1127
01:26:41,286 --> 01:26:43,704
Marylyn, you must leave
the house immediately.

1128
01:26:43,788 --> 01:26:46,123
-It’s imperative that you leave the house.
-Hello, Miles.

1129
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:48,792
-Hello, dear.
-Now, Miles, pending final settlement,

1130
01:26:48,877 --> 01:26:52,213
-you know that I’m entitled to use the house.
-No, no, no! You don't understand, Marylyn.

1131
01:26:52,297 --> 01:26:54,506
-It’s an emergency! Yes.
-An emergency!

1132
01:26:54,591 --> 01:26:55,591
What is it?

1133
01:26:55,675 --> 01:26:59,053
I forgot that I left the gas main on,
which leaks!

1134
01:26:59,137 --> 01:27:02,848
-Good gosh. That sounds dangerous.
-It’s a deadly, odorless, colorless,

1135
01:27:02,933 --> 01:27:06,227
liquidless gas that attacks
the central nervous system

1136
01:27:06,311 --> 01:27:09,271
and causes diarrhea and facial tics!

1137
01:27:09,356 --> 01:27:11,190
Okay. All right.

1138
01:27:11,274 --> 01:27:13,400
-Well, thanks for calling, Miles.
-Okay. Bye-bye.

1139
01:27:16,488 --> 01:27:17,780
I think she bought it.

1140
01:27:22,327 --> 01:27:25,371
So, tell me,

1141
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:30,042
who sent you?

1142
01:27:31,211 --> 01:27:32,670
Mr. Smith.

1143
01:27:33,922 --> 01:27:35,589
Is this Mr. Smith?

1144
01:27:36,549 --> 01:27:37,591
No.

1145
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:39,760
That's his lawyer.

1146
01:27:42,681 --> 01:27:46,558
Whatever they're paying you, I’ll double.

1147
01:27:49,187 --> 01:27:50,771
- What now?
- We wait for Wheezy Joe.

1148
01:27:50,855 --> 01:27:52,773
We tell him it's a no-go.

1149
01:27:52,857 --> 01:27:54,858
Careful. Rottweilers.

1150
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:04,952
Looks like she's gone.
Looks like she bought it.

1151
01:28:05,036 --> 01:28:08,539
- Good stuff. There's no one here.
- Except for the Rottweilers.

1152
01:28:08,623 --> 01:28:11,375
Sure. Rottweilers.

1153
01:28:12,919 --> 01:28:14,545
You go that way.

1154
01:28:42,907 --> 01:28:44,283
Wheezy Joe?

1155
01:29:17,942 --> 01:29:20,861
Wheezy Joe, thank God you're in time.

1156
01:29:20,945 --> 01:29:24,656
You're not in time. We're in time.
Thank God we're in time.

1157
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:27,409
Look, it's a no-go. You get it?

1158
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:30,788
No one need be the wiser,
so you can just go on home.

1159
01:29:30,872 --> 01:29:33,540
Goodbye. You know, thank you so much.

1160
01:29:33,625 --> 01:29:35,793
Hear that? Okay? No, no. No, no.

1161
01:29:35,877 --> 01:29:40,005
No, no. No-go. No contract. It’s off. It’s...

1162
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:42,883
-Will you explain to the lunkhead?
-No-go. It’s a no-go.

1163
01:29:42,967 --> 01:29:46,970
We'll settle your contract later.
Look, you're fired, pal. Let it go. Walk away.

1164
01:29:47,055 --> 01:29:48,847
-Golden parachute.
-Don't let the screen door hit you.

1165
01:29:48,932 --> 01:29:51,225
-Does he speak any language?
-Here's what happened, Mr. Carnera.

1166
01:29:51,309 --> 01:29:53,102
We feel that...

1167
01:29:53,186 --> 01:29:54,561
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1168
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:13,747
Wheezy!

1169
01:30:28,221 --> 01:30:30,180
Told him it was a no-go.

1170
01:30:54,998 --> 01:30:56,999
-Gentlemen.
Freddy.

1171
01:31:00,628 --> 01:31:03,297
-Hello, Marylyn.
-Hello, Miles.

1172
01:31:05,216 --> 01:31:09,595
-This is where we first met, remember?
-Of course I remember.

1173
01:31:10,930 --> 01:31:13,474
It’s hard to believe
that when you walk out that door today,

1174
01:31:13,558 --> 01:31:16,393
you'll be walking out of my life forever.

1175
01:31:17,562 --> 01:31:19,480
It’s not something I wanted either.

1176
01:31:19,564 --> 01:31:21,398
But then, I guess

1177
01:31:22,984 --> 01:31:25,319
something inside of me died

1178
01:31:25,403 --> 01:31:29,072
when I realized that
you'd hired a goon to kill me.

1179
01:31:29,157 --> 01:31:32,451
-Wait a minute. You hired him to kill me.
-No. Both of you wait a minute.

1180
01:31:32,535 --> 01:31:35,287
-Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone.
-Hear, hear.

1181
01:31:35,371 --> 01:31:38,790
Apparently, from what I can gather,
a burglar broke into your house.

1182
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:41,502
-Miles' house.
-Whatever!

1183
01:31:41,586 --> 01:31:45,756
A burglar broke in intending
to loot the place, repented,

1184
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,718
became despondent over his lifestyle
and shot himself.

1185
01:31:49,802 --> 01:31:55,015
-So where does that leave you and me?
Well, we've outlined a settlement.

1186
01:31:55,099 --> 01:31:56,475
We think it's very generous.

1187
01:31:56,559 --> 01:32:00,812
My client is prepared
to consider a reconciliation.

1188
01:32:00,897 --> 01:32:03,065
But how could I trust you, Miles,
after all this?

1189
01:32:03,149 --> 01:32:04,733
See, that's exactly right.
The point is...

1190
01:32:04,817 --> 01:32:06,985
You wounded me first, Marylyn.

1191
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:11,073
I’m not proud of what I’ve done,
but God knows, I did trust you once.

1192
01:32:11,157 --> 01:32:16,119
lf you could just give us another chance.

1193
01:32:16,204 --> 01:32:18,080
Well, if you'll pardon me here,

1194
01:32:18,164 --> 01:32:21,250
but I think my client
is well beyond the point of considering...

1195
01:32:21,334 --> 01:32:25,420
How could I ever trust you again?
I mean really trust you, Miles?

1196
01:32:40,144 --> 01:32:43,647
Marylyn, there is nothing
in the Massey prenup that says

1197
01:32:43,731 --> 01:32:47,025
it can't be executed after the parties wed.

1198
01:32:48,778 --> 01:32:52,155
Well, if this indeed is a Massey prenup,

1199
01:32:53,825 --> 01:32:57,786
and a cursory examination tends to support
that it is, then...

1200
01:33:00,373 --> 01:33:03,041
Oh, my God, Marylyn. You're exposed.

1201
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:08,297
Marylyn.

1202
01:33:17,098 --> 01:33:21,143
Counselor! Freddy!

1203
01:33:21,227 --> 01:33:23,895
Freddy! Come on, Freddy! No fair!

1204
01:33:24,689 --> 01:33:25,897
Freddy!
