00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:39,674
How many times
I gotta tell you?

165
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,682
We're not going there.

166
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,015
I'm serious, Val.
I knew a girl...

167
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,850
who got raped on B.

168
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,356
OK, OK. We're not
going on B, OK?

169
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:49,585
It's so cool
that we are hanging out

170
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,525
with the bands
on New Year's Eve.

171
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:54,120
- When are we meeting them?
- I told you. After the party.

172
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:56,462
So, what about this party?
Are there gonna be any guys there?

173
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:57,796
Does your cousin know any guys?

174
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,961
She knows guys,
but they're weird like her.

175
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:01,129
- Hey!
- That's OK.

176
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:02,137
I like weird guys.

177
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:03,969
I can get into that shit.

178
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,633
So where's this party, Soho?

179
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,973
- Noho.
- Noho? I thought you said Soho.

180
00:08:08,045 --> 00:08:09,137
No. I said Noho.

181
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:10,646
That's not even a real place.

182
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:11,976
They just made that up.

183
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:13,641
That's not even
on the map or nothin'.

184
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:16,584
Well, excuse me, OK?
Wherever it is, it's right up ahead.

185
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:20,248
I love the East Village.
It is so cool.

186
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:22,451
I mean, all the cool people
live here!

187
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:23,788
- Wait a minute.
- What?

188
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:25,453
I thought this was the place.

189
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:26,461
This shithole?

190
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,192
Yeah. This is the address
she gave me.

191
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,359
- You're shittin' me.
- No!

192
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:33,403
This is the address
I wrote down.

193
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,437
So call her up.

194
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:35,767
I don't have her number.

195
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,035
What the fuck you carrying around
in that pocketbook?

196
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:39,700
A fuckin'
Encyclopedia Britannica?

197
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:41,574
I got makeup and shit in there.

198
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,112
Makeup and shit?
That's just great.

199
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,444
We're totally fucked
on New Year's Eve

200
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,416
with a pocketbook
full of makeup

201
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:50,248
- And this shithole building address.
- What should we do?

202
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,447
There's nothing we can do.
We're fucked.

203
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,088
Look, I'll call and see
if she's listed.

204
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,148
All right?

205
00:09:00,064 --> 00:09:01,053
You got a dime?

206
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:03,326
She better be listed, Val!

207
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:15,677
Oh, God.

208
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:19,014
Uhh!

Hi! Happy New Year!

Hey, baby.

00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:33,024
- Excuse me.
- Hi!

215
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:35,190
How's it hang?

216
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,029
Sorry.

217
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:39,035
You want a piece of me? Huh?

218
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:41,037
Hey... knock it off.

Ow!

220
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:45,041
- Hi.
- Hi.

221
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:46,701
- Ha ha ha!
- Asshole.

222
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:54,645
- You used to go out with her?
- It was a long time ago.

223
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:56,652
How long ago?

224
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,950
l... I don't know. Um...

225
00:09:59,023 --> 00:09:59,955
Well...

226
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:01,926
Um, maybe 6 months ago.

227
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,185
Six months?

228
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,852
You think that's a long time?

229
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:06,863
Yeah, I do.
I think 6 months

230
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:09,024
is a considerable
length of time.

231
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:10,361
Ugh!

232
00:10:10,434 --> 00:10:12,026
Do you believe this place?

233
00:10:12,102 --> 00:10:14,195
Do you think 6 months
is a long time

234
00:10:14,271 --> 00:10:15,704
to have broken up
with somebody?

235
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:16,865
Oh, I guess...

236
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:19,409
if it's a clean break.

237
00:10:19,476 --> 00:10:21,671

this party tonight.

240
00:10:25,783 --> 00:10:26,807
You went out with her?

241
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:29,409
Look, the only reason
I said we would go

242
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:32,421
is because she's afraid
no one's gonna turn up.

243
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:35,083
You spoke to her?

244
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,253
Yes, when she invited me.

245
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:41,162
Do you think she's right
about no one showing up?

246
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:43,165
Well, I'm not going.

247
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:45,960
Excuse me.

248
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:48,603
Right back.

249
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:57,375
See how fun this is?
This is so fun.

250
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,040
Whoo!

251
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,380
I think that bartender
likes you.

252
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,387
Pfft! He doesn't like me.
He likes you.

253
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,946
Really? Do you think so?

254
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:09,891
He is dreamy, sex-bomb cute.

255
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:16,057
Yeah, he's adorable.

256
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,293
Hey, man...

257
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,529
Hey! Man!

258
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:20,763
You're a fox.

259
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:23,033
Don't sell yourself short, sir.

The night's young.

261
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,070
He's gotta be depressed

262
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,576
working on New Year's Eve.

263
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:29,407
I'm gonna invite him
to this party.

264
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,744
Everyone's depressed
on New Year's Eve.

265
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:34,409
Only you are depressed
on New Year's Eve.

266
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,749
I'm having a great time. See?

268
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:40,949
What are you talking about?

269
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:42,754
It's the obligation
to enjoy yourself.

270
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:44,418
That's what does it.
Every year,

271
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,429
it's the same,
desperate scrambling around

272
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,931
to surround yourself with
as many people as possible,

273
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,796
go to some stupid party,
pretend to be happy,

274
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,733
when really your girlfriend
just left you,

275
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:54,737
and you have no career.

276
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,569
Are you gonna be
like this all night?

277
00:11:58,809 --> 00:11:59,741
Yeah.

278
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:11,581
Taxi!

279
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,715
Thank...

280
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:15,724
you.

281
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:19,420
Hi. Uh...

282
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:21,589
No, thanks, anyway, heh.

283
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:25,198
Wait! Uh...

284
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,430
No. No. You go ahead.

285
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:29,438
You go pick up somebody else.

286
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:30,564
I'll be OK.

287
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:34,133
Uh, excuse me, baby girl...

288
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,940
You seem to be experiencing
a little indecision.

289
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:37,503
I do?

290
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:40,049
Yeah. You have this
whole ambivalent vibe

291
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:43,052
radiating from your persona.
Something is wrong, mama.

292
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,486
Oh, I ju... oh!

293
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,456
- Hmm.
- Oops.

294
00:12:47,524 --> 00:12:48,786
l, uh...

295
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:50,622
I'm sorry.

296
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:53,026
It's just this guy, you know?

297
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:54,894
Always is, baby.

298
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:56,899
Yeah, I was at this party...

299
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,026
and I saw him there...

300
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:02,004
and he was just... so...

301
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:06,538
Heh, anyway, l... I ended up
going home with him,

302
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,874
and I've never done anything
like that before,

303
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:10,538
so now I just want everything

304
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:13,048
to be perfect, you know? And...

305
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:14,379
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:18,478
I don't know why I'm
telling you all this.

307
00:13:18,555 --> 00:13:20,489
Baby, come here for a second.

308
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:23,082
Sweetheart, you know
what you need to do?

309
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:26,360
You need to get in this cab.

310
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,227
l... I do?

311
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:31,597
You've gotta say yes
to your destiny.

312
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,226
- I do?
- Yeah!

313
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,066
Life's happenin' right now, baby.

314
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,504
Look around you.
Look around you.

315
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,507
There go some life,
and over there, too.

316
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:41,009
Come on, mama... live!

317
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:44,206
Live tonight! Say yes.

318
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,873
Come on.

319
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,280
Uh... yes.

320
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:48,443
Say it loud.

321
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,611
Yes! Ha ha ha!

322
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:51,620
Come on, like you feel it.
Come on, baby.

323
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:53,417
- Yes!
- There you go.

324
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,755
Get in this cab.
Destiny awaits.

325
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:57,816
OK.

326
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,239
What time is it?

Look, I've had it with him,

332
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:33,395
and I'm not letting him
push me into

333
00:14:33,463 --> 00:14:35,055
this old girlfriend,
party thing.

334
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:36,394
Absolutely not.

335

They only broke up
6 months ago, right?

336
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:41,434
Please, they're practically
still going out.

337
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,598
Too bad, in a way.

338
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:47,476
He was the most
successful artist

339
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:48,636
I've dated this year,

340
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,612
and he was kind of nice,
you know?

341
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,080
Please.
He was too nice.

342
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,743
Going out with him was,
like, take your medicine.

343
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:57,218
Huh. And then...

344
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,380
he takes me to his gallery today

345
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:02,016
to see his new show.

346
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:03,525
And it sucks.

00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:04,856
Ah! It sucked?

00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,759
Yes. I can't even tell you.

You wouldn't even
believe his work, OK?

350

It's like... big,
abstract vaginas.

- Or something.
- Ugh.

I hate abstract.

353
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:18,234
But at least he has a gallery.

354
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,570
I mean, that's something.

He's the worst.

OK, so, this is the address...

so you can check it out after work.

362

I think there's gonna be
a lot of people there.

Oh. OK.

I mean, I don't mean
I'm with him

367
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:49,496
because we're just friends,

368

and we're not together...

Shit! Do you think
he even heard me?

370
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,605
It's inevitable, you know?

371
00:15:54,678 --> 00:15:56,441
You let somebody move in with you,

372
00:15:56,513 --> 00:15:58,310
you make all these
little compromises

373

to smooth things along,
and the next thing you know,

you're on some macrobiotic diet,

to Joni Mitchell!

- And then you know what they say?
- No.

like me the way I am?

you already know.

No, you won't.

659
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:23,571
You say you will,
but you won't.

660
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:25,072
Hillary, please, please,

661
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:27,075
please don't leave me here
all alone

662
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:28,906
with the streamers
and the crab dip.

663
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:29,945
I can't take it!

664
00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:31,070
Jesus! Do you hear yourself?

665
00:26:31,147 --> 00:26:33,081
Hillary, listen.

666
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:35,583
You want to meet
interesting guys, right?

667
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:38,085
If you stay,
I'll give you Eric.

668
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:39,587
Eric? Who's Eric?

669
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:41,589
You know, Eric,
my last boyfriend.

670
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,591
I don't believe
I recall an Eric.

671
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,593
Hillary, Jesus,
we only broke up 6 months ago.

672
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:47,754
Look, I don't remember
who I was dating

673
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,092
6 months ago.

674
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:50,598
You remember Eric.

675
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:53,032
The painter,
the one with the accent.

676
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:55,536
Remember when we went
to a show together?

677
00:26:55,604 --> 00:26:58,038
He does all these big abstract
paintings with the, um...

678
00:26:58,107 --> 00:26:59,540
Oh, with the flowers?

679
00:26:59,608 --> 00:27:00,540
Yes, exactly.

680
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:02,042
He isn't seeing anyone?

681
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:03,544
Not anyone worth mentioning.

682
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:04,874
OK. I'll do it.

683
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:05,879
You'll stay?

684
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:07,040
No, no. I'm still leaving.

685
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:08,549
But now I'll come back.

686
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:10,050
What... What do you mean,
you'll come back?

687
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,552
We made a deal.

688
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,554
I know, but I wasn't
coming back before.

689
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:14,554
Now I will.

690
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:17,057
But... No, that's...
that's not our deal.

691
00:27:17,126 --> 00:27:19,560
Our deal was you're
not supposed to leave!

692
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:20,720
Ohh!

693
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:21,728
Woman: Maria!

694
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,398
Are you breaking up with me?

695
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:26,833
I don't know what to say.

696
00:27:26,902 --> 00:27:28,233
I thought everything was fine.

697
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:30,670
Look, to tell you the truth,

698
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,072
I'm still in love
with my old boyfriend.

699
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:35,042
He's French-Canadian.

700
00:27:36,145 --> 00:27:40,343
Yeah, and I met him...
while... I was...

701
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,348
Camping.

702
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,406
Camping.

703
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:43,952
Ha ha ha.

704
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,487
I don't believe this.

705
00:27:45,554 --> 00:27:47,419
We didn't even
officially break up.

706
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,219
Um, he just...

707
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,553
disappeared.

708
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:51,957
Disappeared?

709
00:27:52,028 --> 00:27:54,496
While we were on
a mountain-climbing trip.

710
00:27:54,563 --> 00:27:55,530
We all thought he was dead.

711
00:27:55,598 --> 00:27:57,259
But he called
this morning, so...

712
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,699
So he just called you up
out of the blue.

713
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:00,793
Just called you up to say,

714
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,701
Hey, how are you?
I'm not dead.

715
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:04,467
That's right.

716
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,371
Well, that's the most
ridiculous story

717
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:07,932
I've ever heard
in my entire life.

718
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,376
Eric, Jesus, Eric...

719
00:28:10,446 --> 00:28:13,415
And what kind of woman
are you anyway,

720
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:15,177
just blurting it out like this

721
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:17,811
in the street on New Year's Eve?

722
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:19,047
I'm sorry.

723
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,213
Oh, you're sorry?

724
00:28:20,289 --> 00:28:22,257
Yeah, well, yeah, well, yeah,

725
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:24,155
well, you better
be sorry, sweetheart,

726
00:28:24,226 --> 00:28:26,285
because you're the one
that has to live with this.

727
00:28:26,362 --> 00:28:28,922
Not me. You're the one
inventing old boyfriends

728
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,296
and bringing them back
from the dead.

729
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:35,531
And you, with your
sordid little agenda.

730
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:37,504
Well... Oh, I've had it with you.

731
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:39,234
You deserve each other.

732
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,868
I don't believe this!

733
00:28:41,944 --> 00:28:44,071
Oh, my God.
Do you believe him?

734
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:45,078
Really.

735
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:46,079
Do you believe him?

736
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:48,480
Like it's your fault
he's bad in bed.

737
00:28:50,586 --> 00:28:52,451
[Rock Music Playing]

738
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:57,721
There's no answer.

739
00:28:57,793 --> 00:28:59,454
Oh, my God,
there's no answer?

740
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:00,552
What the fuck
is your mother doing

741
00:29:00,629 --> 00:29:01,891
not answering her phone?

742
00:29:01,964 --> 00:29:03,795
I don't know. Maybe she went
to a party or something.

743
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:05,163
Oh, my God.

744
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:07,031
Or maybe she's down
in the laundry room.

745
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:08,229
Well, what the fuck
are we supposed to do,

746
00:29:08,304 --> 00:29:11,068
hang out for the rinse cycle
or something?

747
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,539
I don't know.

748
00:29:12,608 --> 00:29:13,802
All right, this is
what you're gonna do.

749
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:15,002
You're going to call this band

750
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:16,305
and tell them we're meeting
them early, all right?

751
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:17,367
End of story.

752
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:18,640
I can't.

753
00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:20,079
What do you mean you can't?

754
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:22,117
I just can't, all right?

755
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:25,415
Oh, my God.
There is no band, is there?

756
00:29:25,488 --> 00:29:26,716
What are you talking about?

757
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:27,881
I'm talking about you.

758
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:29,857
The liar who's been
bragging for months

759
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:30,892
about how we're gonna
meet this band

760
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,928
on New Year's Eve
in New York City,

761
00:29:32,995 --> 00:29:34,053
when there ain't no band.

762
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,324
There ain't no nothing.

763
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:36,386
It was the only way
I could get you

764
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:37,523
to come into the city with me.

765
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,295
I bet your cousin
isn't even having a party.

766
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:43,862
She is having a party.
I just need the address.

767
00:29:48,944 --> 00:29:50,707
All right, look.
We'll go in here,

768
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:51,905
we'll get a couple beers,

769
00:29:51,981 --> 00:29:53,471
and I'll try it again later.

770
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:54,948
We don't belong in there, Val.

771
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:56,109
We don't belong on B.

772
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,413
We're in way over our heads here.

773
00:29:57,486 --> 00:30:00,853
Stephie, we got money,
we got fake I.D.s.

774
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:01,912
From where I'm standing,

775
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:03,390
we got just as much right
to be in there

776
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:04,790
as anybody else.

777
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:07,991
Oh, my God.

778
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:09,030
What? What's the matter?

779
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,224
It's those guys.

780
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:12,426
It's those guys.
They're definitely following us.

781
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:13,433
Are they cute?

782
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:14,730
- Val!
- I'm just asking.

783
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:16,236
All right, come on, let's go.

784
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:19,338
Stephie: Excuse me!

785
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,972
You know what?

786
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:25,138
I can't even tell you
how many men I've fucked.

787
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:26,306
I believe you.

788
00:30:26,382 --> 00:30:27,610
I couldn't... I couldn't
even make a list anymore.

789
00:30:27,683 --> 00:30:28,741
That's how many there are.

790
00:30:28,817 --> 00:30:31,012
Lucy, I believe you fucked
many, many men, OK?

791
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:32,018
A lot more than Ellie.

792
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:33,019
Just drop this now, please.

793
00:30:33,088 --> 00:30:34,112
That's for sure.

794
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,283
She's too busy being expressive

795
00:30:36,358 --> 00:30:38,053
and making trivial
performance art

796
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,618
to attract anybody but you.

797
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:42,857
And Jack, of course.

798
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:44,229
What?

799
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,824
Well, Jack will fuck anybody.

800
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:49,694
Ellie and Jack?
When did that happen?

801
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:51,603
I don't know.
Three weeks ago, a month.

802
00:30:51,674 --> 00:30:54,142
Recently?
While we were still together?

803
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,336
Why didn't you tell me?

804
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:57,379
Kevin, I thought you knew.
Everybody knew.

805
00:30:57,446 --> 00:31:00,643
Apparently not everyone.

806
00:31:00,716 --> 00:31:02,183
I can't believe this.

807
00:31:02,251 --> 00:31:05,516
It must be part of
the whole Zelda thing.

808
00:31:05,588 --> 00:31:07,818
The whole, you know,
high-strung,

809
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,755
tempestuous,

810
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:10,985
castrating,

811
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,493
bitch from hell,

812
00:31:12,561 --> 00:31:14,586
make my life miserable persona.

813
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:26,398
You know, this is turning out
to be the worst birthday ever.

814
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:29,638
l... I wasn't expecting much,
but this is an unprecedented low.

815
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:30,804
Don't try to make me
feel sorry for you.

816
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:31,937
Don't even start.

817
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:35,108
'Cause I'm... I'm so sick
of your shit tonight.

818
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,208
You know what, Kevin?

819
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:37,411

00:38:11,412 --> 00:38:13,903
Oh, hey, how you doing?

984
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:16,212
Wow, it's kind of, uh,
hot in there, huh?

985
00:38:16,284 --> 00:38:20,516
We thought we'd come out here
and get some air and just, um,

986
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:25,218
and, uh, take this opportunity
to introduce ourselves.

987
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:27,659
My name's Tom. This is Dave.

988
00:38:27,729 --> 00:38:31,392
And, uh... hey, man,
he has no manners.

989
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:32,899
Show the ladies what
we've got for them, bro.

990
00:38:32,967 --> 00:38:34,093
Mmm.

991
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:43,944
Beverages. Beer.

992
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:53,814
[Sizzling]

993
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:01,586
Ha ha.

994
00:39:03,832 --> 00:39:05,857
Jack, you're doing it again.

995
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:09,199
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just, uh,

996
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,862
you know, what can I say?

997
00:39:10,939 --> 00:39:13,134
This is... This is
turning out to be

998
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,108
a pretty unusual evening.

999
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:18,205
Unusual?

1000
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:20,042
How?

1001
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:22,674
Well, unusual, um,

1002
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,119
in no, uh,
particular way. Look...

1003
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:30,851
Um, Cindy, I hate
to press a point here,

1004
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:32,586
but I keep thinking
about what you said earlier

1005
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,651
about last night being
your first time and everything.

1006
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:36,060
What about it?

1007
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,293
I wonder, you know, why me?

1008
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,096
You know, what... what
was it about me

1009
00:39:41,169 --> 00:39:44,036
in particular, OK?
Being specific,

1010
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:47,302
that made you decide to,
you know.

1011
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:52,142
Oh, yeah, OK, yeah, right.

1012
00:39:52,213 --> 00:39:54,977
It's, um...

1013
00:39:55,049 --> 00:39:56,744
Why did I choose you?

1014
00:39:59,854 --> 00:40:02,015
Mmm...

1015
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,285
Drawing a blank.

1016
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:10,829
That's... That's OK, drawing a...

1017
00:40:10,899 --> 00:40:14,460
You know that they say,
uh, blanks are, um...

1018
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:17,265
Look, uh, as an actor,

1019
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:19,966
Cindy, I find myself
very intrigued

1020
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,633
by people's motivations.

1021
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:24,111
Mm-hmm.

1022
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:26,007
Look, you're...

1023
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,273
you're a very attractive girl.

1024
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:28,871
You must have had
lots of opportunities.

1025
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:30,507
Especially as pretty as you are,

1026
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:32,575
I'm surprised it hasn't
happened by accident,

1027
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:34,449
so a guy has to wonder...

1028
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:36,182
what makes him so great?

1029
00:40:36,256 --> 00:40:41,558
Well, one thing I remember
about last night was...

1030
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:42,595
Yes.

1031
00:40:44,364 --> 00:40:45,888
That you were
probably the most...

1032
00:40:45,966 --> 00:40:47,831
The most what?

1033
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:49,266
Oh, God.

1034
00:40:49,336 --> 00:40:50,530
You OK?

1035
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:51,571
Here, drink some water.

1036
00:40:51,638 --> 00:40:52,536
- Oh, God.
- Drink!

1037
00:40:52,606 --> 00:40:53,630
- Drink it!
- [Glass Dings]

1038
00:40:53,707 --> 00:40:54,696
- Ow!
- Here, no.

1039
00:40:54,774 --> 00:40:57,436
Uh, that'll make it worse.
Have some wine.

1040
00:40:57,511 --> 00:40:59,342
Is it better?

1041
00:40:59,412 --> 00:41:00,674
You probably ate
one of those chilies.

1042
00:41:00,747 --> 00:41:02,578
No, it was so big.

1043
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:07,552
Try to keep it in your mouth.

1044
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:09,145
It was so big.

1045
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:10,780
I thought it was okra.

1046
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:12,017
Okra's brown.

1047
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:13,184
What, are you OK?

1048
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,249
Mmm!

1049
00:41:14,327 --> 00:41:16,420
I'll be... fine.

1050
00:41:16,496 --> 00:41:17,895
Eww!

1051
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:19,192
I'll be OK.

1052
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:22,166
Oh!

1053
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:24,697
It's all right.
It's all right.

1054
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:26,329
It's all right.
This happens every day.

1055
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:27,771
I'm sorry.

1056
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:29,103
Oh!

1057
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:31,110
Oh!

1058
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:33,169
Oh.

1059
00:41:33,246 --> 00:41:34,213
I'll be right back.

1060
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:35,612
That is fine! No problem.

1061
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:38,583
It happens here every night.

1062
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:40,142
The most what?

1063
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:42,753
No, I'm not going to shut up.

1064
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:43,754
I have a right to know.

1065
00:41:43,823 --> 00:41:44,755
I have a right to know

1066
00:41:44,824 --> 00:41:47,122
why you won't fuck me, Kevin.

1067
00:41:47,194 --> 00:41:48,218
Lucy, do you want to fuck?

1068
00:41:48,295 --> 00:41:50,058
Because if you really,
really want to fuck,

1069
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,495
we'll fuck, OK?

1070
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:53,362
You don't think I'm serious.

1071
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:55,560
How long have we known each other?

1072
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:57,262
In the... ln the 5 years
we've known each other,

1073
00:41:57,337 --> 00:41:59,498
have you once even ever
considered having sex with me?

1074
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:01,040
Apart from tonight.

1075
00:42:01,107 --> 00:42:03,405
You don't think
I'm attracted to you.

1076
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:05,444
I don't think you're attracted
to half the men you sleep with.

1077
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:06,809
You think I'm a slut!

1078
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,847
What? No.

1079
00:42:07,914 --> 00:42:10,246
Yeah, you think I'm a big slut.

1080
00:42:10,317 --> 00:42:12,114
I don't think you're a slut.

1081
00:42:12,185 --> 00:42:15,643
A... A stanky, little ho maybe,

1082
00:42:15,722 --> 00:42:16,746
but never a slut.

1083
00:42:16,823 --> 00:42:20,281
The truth is you're afraid.

1084
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,452
What? I'm afraid.

1085
00:42:21,528 --> 00:42:24,497
I'm, yeah, OK, you...
I feel so naked right now.

1086
00:42:24,564 --> 00:42:25,531
I'm totally afraid.

1087
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,226
It is so obvious.

1088
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,825
And so ridiculous.

1089
00:42:29,903 --> 00:42:31,666
Prove it.

1090
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:34,573
I don't have to prove anything.

1091
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:36,074
I dare you.

1092
00:42:37,177 --> 00:42:39,202
Kevin, I dare you to fuck me.

1093
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,673
What? So what, now?

1094
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:44,740
You want to go
to some smelly bathroom

1095
00:42:44,818 --> 00:42:47,116
and, uh, have loveless
New Year's sex

1096
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:50,054
in the stench of air freshener?

1097
00:42:50,123 --> 00:42:51,556
Unless you're chicken.

1098
00:43:05,105 --> 00:43:06,265
So we got to go back to the club

1099
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:07,772
to deliver this package
to my friend Tony.

1100
00:43:07,841 --> 00:43:08,773
Is that cool?

1101
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:10,275
Yeah, it's cool.

1102
00:43:10,343 --> 00:43:13,141
So, uh, what's
in this package anyway?

1103
00:43:13,213 --> 00:43:15,738
It's, uh...

1104
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:16,975
Well, it's, uh,
you know, it's uh,

1105
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,745
it's like I said,
it's for my friend Tony.

1106
00:43:18,818 --> 00:43:19,944
Oh, yeah? It's for Tony?

1107
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,544
All right.
Well, I'm leaving.

1108
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:22,588
Where you going?

1109
00:43:22,656 --> 00:43:23,918
I'm going to the train station

1110
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,515
to get out of here before
these jerks get us killed.

1111
00:43:26,593 --> 00:43:28,527
You wanted to hang out
with the bands, right?

1112
00:43:28,595 --> 00:43:30,358
These guys are musicians.

1113
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,024
They're roadies, Val.
There's a little difference.

1114
00:43:34,634 --> 00:43:35,726
I didn't want to have
to tell you this

1115
00:43:35,802 --> 00:43:38,362
'cause I know
you're gonna spaz out,

1116
00:43:38,438 --> 00:43:39,905
but the last train for Ronkonkoma

1117
00:43:39,973 --> 00:43:41,702
left an hour ago.

1118
00:43:41,775 --> 00:43:44,903
Are you telling me we're
stranded here for the night?

1119
00:43:44,978 --> 00:43:46,536
We gotta book. You coming?

1120
00:43:46,613 --> 00:43:48,513
Yeah, we're coming.

[Whispers]
Heroin.

1122
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:53,719
Oh, Stephie, you know?

1123
00:43:56,289 --> 00:43:57,449
Caitlyn, I'm warning you,

1124
00:43:57,524 --> 00:43:59,515
keep your slutty hands
off my bartender.

1125
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:00,752
He's not your bartender.

1126
00:44:00,827 --> 00:44:03,990
He's our bartender.

1127
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:06,692
Caitlyn, your skirt's been
over your head for hours.

1128
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:09,257
Jesus, like it's my fault
I'm irresistible to men.

1129
00:44:09,336 --> 00:44:13,102
Look, he wants me.
Not you, me.

1130
00:44:13,173 --> 00:44:14,140
You think so?

1131
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,072
Yeah, I do think so.

1132
00:44:16,142 --> 00:44:17,040
Hey, guys.

1133
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,304
- Hi.
- Hi.

1134
00:44:18,378 --> 00:44:20,403
Listen, I think it's still
a bit early for this party.

1135
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,141
What do you say we
go get some cocktails?

1136
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:31,380
Eric: For some reason,

1137
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:32,789
every single woman
I go out with

1138
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:35,259
ends up breaking up with me.

1139
00:44:35,328 --> 00:44:37,023
I mean, why is that, Monica?

1140
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:40,396
I don't know.
Lots of reasons probably.

1141
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:41,991
Yeah, right.

1142
00:44:42,068 --> 00:44:44,195
Yeah,
it's always lots of reasons.

1146

What was your reason?

1147
00:44:51,745 --> 00:44:54,339
Oh, really, Eric, who remembers?

1148
00:44:54,414 --> 00:44:56,678
You don't remember?
It was only 6 months ago.

1149
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,082
Well, 6 months is a long time.

1150
00:44:59,152 --> 00:45:01,177
No, 6 months is nothing!

1151
00:45:01,254 --> 00:45:03,313
Jesus, Eric, relax.

1152
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,985
OK, fine. You don't remember
the lame excuse

1153
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,324
you gave me 6 months ago
for breaking up with me.

1154

I'll tell you.

1155

You like me as a friend,
but not as a boyfriend,

1156

even though
you found me attractive.

1157

That's not lame.

1158
00:45:18,171 --> 00:45:19,968
It makes no sense whatsoever.

I'm talking about.

to deal with.

what?

1169

Really, Eric, you just
got to calm down.

1170

Look, all I'm asking for
is the truth.

1171
00:45:45,698 --> 00:45:47,893
If you want to break up
with me, fine.

1172

Just tell me the reason why.

1173

Is that too much to ask?

don't do this. Don't go.

The truth is
I broke up with you

1189
00:46:37,283 --> 00:46:39,649
because you were the worst lover

OK? And I'm sorry

1466
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:54,518
that you're so bad in bed.
I really am.

1467
00:57:54,593 --> 00:57:56,026
But most of all, I'm sorry

1468
00:57:56,094 --> 00:57:58,494
that I decided to throw
this atrocity,

1469
00:57:58,563 --> 00:58:01,498
this nightmarish ordeal
of a New Year's party

1470
00:58:01,566 --> 00:58:02,965
because this is breaking me,
Eric.

1471
00:58:03,035 --> 00:58:05,663
Do you understand me?
This party is breaking me.

1472
00:58:05,737 --> 00:58:07,034
Nnhh!

1473
00:58:09,608 --> 00:58:11,337
You don't have to get
so emotional.

1474
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:13,537
I mean, it's not that bad.

1475
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:15,045
It's not that bad?

1476
00:58:16,782 --> 00:58:19,080
It's not that bad?

1477
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:23,554
Eric, we are standing here
with one hostess

1478
00:58:23,622 --> 00:58:26,614
who's on the verge of hysteria

1479
00:58:26,692 --> 00:58:31,629
and one guest... one guest...
who spent the entire evening

1480
00:58:31,697 --> 00:58:33,892
coming to terms with
his sexual problems, OK?

1481
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:36,058
That's it! That's my party!

1482
00:58:36,134 --> 00:58:38,227
Happy fucking New Year!

1483
00:58:41,073 --> 00:58:41,869
How could I have been
so stupid?

1484
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,907
Wait up.

1485
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:43,941
Of course Ellie's
gonna show up tonight,

1486
00:58:44,009 --> 00:58:44,907
given that it's
the worst possible thing

1487
00:58:44,976 --> 00:58:46,671
that could happen.

1488
00:58:46,745 --> 00:58:48,110
I'm never gonna forgive you
for this, Lucy.

1489
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,545
It's not my fault
your girlfriend caught us

1490
00:58:49,614 --> 00:58:50,911
making out in a bathroom stall.

1491
00:58:50,982 --> 00:58:52,108
You know,
I didn't hear any complaints

1492
00:58:52,184 --> 00:58:53,276
when your hands were up my dress!

1493
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:54,443
You know,
this is a big joke to you,

1494
00:58:54,519 --> 00:58:56,578
but this is my life.
You don't understand.

1495
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:58,122
You should be thanking me
for helping you

1496
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:00,090
sever a totally
unhealthy relationship.

1497
00:59:00,158 --> 00:59:01,147
Thanking you? My life

1498
00:59:01,226 --> 00:59:02,625
is totally screwed up now
because of you.

1499
00:59:02,694 --> 00:59:05,629
Your life has been totally
dark, evil, and nihilistic

1500
00:59:05,697 --> 00:59:06,857
since the day I met you!

1501
00:59:06,932 --> 00:59:07,864
It never gets any better.

1502
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:09,093
You're so depressed, Kevin.

1503
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:10,634
The only reason
I keep you around as my friend

1504
00:59:10,702 --> 00:59:12,135
is because you
make my life look great

1505
00:59:12,204 --> 00:59:13,136
by comparison.

1506
00:59:13,205 --> 00:59:14,763
Oh, thank you.
What a humanitarian!

1507
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,932
Your life's a rose!

1508
00:59:16,007 --> 00:59:17,406
Maybe I should leave.

1509
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:21,375
Maybe you should!

1510
00:59:22,547 --> 00:59:24,708
Where you going?

1511
00:59:24,783 --> 00:59:27,343
To find that bartender.

1512
00:59:27,419 --> 00:59:29,011
The bartender?
Well, that's just perfect.

1513
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:29,849
Give him my regards.

1514
00:59:29,921 --> 00:59:31,821
I will. Fuck you!

1515
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,551
Fuck you!

1516
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:34,717
Just remember, I was the one

1517
00:59:34,793 --> 00:59:37,819
that wanted
to stay home tonight, Lucy.

1518
00:59:53,845 --> 00:59:54,777
Oh!

1519
00:59:54,846 --> 00:59:56,279
Jack, what are you doing?

1520
00:59:56,348 --> 00:59:57,747
Nothing. I just, uh...

1521
00:59:58,817 --> 01:00:00,375
Mm...

1522
01:00:07,058 --> 01:00:08,525
Mm. [Giggles]

1523
01:00:17,202 --> 01:00:18,999
Hey, you OK over there?

1524
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,095
Wow...

1525
01:00:21,173 --> 01:00:22,435
OK, let's go now.

1526
01:00:22,507 --> 01:00:23,371
Oh.

1527
01:00:23,441 --> 01:00:25,932
I guess I was wrong
about tonight

1528
01:00:26,011 --> 01:00:27,672
turning out to be so terrible.

1529
01:00:27,746 --> 01:00:29,907
Yeah. Maybe. But let's
just go to the party, OK?

1530
01:00:29,981 --> 01:00:31,414
No. Jack, I mean,

1531
01:00:31,483 --> 01:00:33,917
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

1532
01:00:33,985 --> 01:00:34,974
What?

1533
01:00:35,053 --> 01:00:38,716
I mean, I... I think
I'm in love with you.

1534
01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:41,020
Oh... not again.

1535
01:00:41,092 --> 01:00:42,457
What do you mean
not again?

1536
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:44,290
Look, don't do this, OK?
Just don't do this.

1537
01:00:44,362 --> 01:00:45,624
You don't even know me.

1538
01:00:45,697 --> 01:00:49,133
But I like you, and I
thought you liked me.

1539
01:00:49,201 --> 01:00:50,964
Yeah. I do like you.
I like you a lot.

1540
01:00:51,036 --> 01:00:53,470
But I like a lot of people. See?

1541
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,837
Yeah, I see.

1542
01:00:56,908 --> 01:00:58,603
Oh, come on, don't be like that.
Look, Cheryl...

1543
01:00:58,677 --> 01:01:00,201
Cindy!

1544
01:01:00,278 --> 01:01:03,475
My name is Cindy!

1545
01:01:03,548 --> 01:01:04,708
Right. I know. I'm sorry.

1546
01:01:04,783 --> 01:01:05,943
Who's Cheryl?

1547
01:01:06,017 --> 01:01:08,451
She's... wh... th...
it doesn't matter.

1548
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,249
You're in love with
this Cheryl person?

1549
01:01:10,322 --> 01:01:12,256
No! No. I'm not in love
with anybody.

1550
01:01:12,324 --> 01:01:15,259
That's the point.
The whole topic makes me uncomfortable.

1551
01:01:15,327 --> 01:01:16,760
Look, let's just forget everything,

1552
01:01:16,828 --> 01:01:18,762
and we'll go to the party.
OK? Come on.

1553
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:19,922
Go to the party with me.

1554
01:01:19,998 --> 01:01:21,090
Be careful on the ice.

1555
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:22,758
I wouldn't go
to that party with you

1556
01:01:22,834 --> 01:01:24,699
if you were
the last man on Earth.

1557
01:01:24,769 --> 01:01:25,929
Come on, don't do this, Cindy.

1558
01:01:26,004 --> 01:01:27,528
Oh, go to hell! Aah!

1559
01:01:27,606 --> 01:01:30,734
Aah, aah, oh, God.

1560
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:32,538
Oh, my God!

1561
01:01:32,611 --> 01:01:34,943
Oh... God!

1562
01:01:35,013 --> 01:01:36,105
You all right?

1563
01:01:36,181 --> 01:01:40,049
No! I think I landed in
a big pile of dog shit!

1564
01:01:40,118 --> 01:01:41,346
Eww!

1565
01:01:41,419 --> 01:01:42,443
Eww!

1566
01:01:45,156 --> 01:01:47,090
Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed.

1567
01:01:47,158 --> 01:01:48,591
It's not that bad. Really.

1568
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,389
It's not that bad.

1569
01:01:50,462 --> 01:01:52,953
Oh, leave me alone!

1570
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:55,090
Jesus, I hate you.

1571
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:57,100
You're just such a big phony!

1572
01:01:57,168 --> 01:01:59,602
It's like you're not nice at all!

1573
01:01:59,671 --> 01:02:00,899
I never said I was nice.

1574
01:02:00,972 --> 01:02:02,030
You're the one
who kept going on all night

1575
01:02:02,107 --> 01:02:03,233
about how nice I was.

1576
01:02:03,308 --> 01:02:05,640
Oh, you're so conceited!

1577
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:06,904
What are you talking about?

1578
01:02:06,978 --> 01:02:08,809
You think I haven't noticed?

1579
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,407
I mean, ever since you
found out I was a virgin

1580
01:02:12,484 --> 01:02:13,849
before last night,

1581
01:02:13,919 --> 01:02:16,410
you've been hounding me
for a reason why.

1582
01:02:16,488 --> 01:02:18,149
Why did I choose you?

1583
01:02:18,223 --> 01:02:20,157
What was it about you?
You, you, you!

1584
01:02:20,225 --> 01:02:21,624
That's all you care about!

1585
01:02:21,693 --> 01:02:23,126
I was curious.

1586
01:02:23,194 --> 01:02:27,290
Listen, you think there was
something special about you?

1587
01:02:27,365 --> 01:02:31,096
Well, guess what?
It could've been anybody.

1588
01:02:31,169 --> 01:02:32,466
Yeah, that's right.

1589
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:33,868
You were just there.

1590
01:02:33,939 --> 01:02:36,134
I would have gone home
with anybody last night.

1591
01:02:36,207 --> 01:02:38,641
I just wanted
to get it over with.

1592
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,143
It could've been anybody!

1593
01:02:40,211 --> 01:02:41,872
OK, date's over.
Look, why don't we

1594
01:02:41,947 --> 01:02:43,380
just end this date
right here, OK?

1595
01:02:43,448 --> 01:02:44,415
That's fine with me.

1596
01:02:44,482 --> 01:02:45,471
We'll both go home,
and if we're lucky,

1597
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:46,642
we'll never have to
see each other again.

1598
01:02:46,718 --> 01:02:47,650
Sounds perfect.

1599
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:48,879
Great. Wanna share a cab?

1600
01:02:48,954 --> 01:02:49,886
Fine!

1601
01:02:49,955 --> 01:02:50,887
Fine.

1602
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:55,892
I bet that Cheryl person
hates you, too.

1603
01:02:55,961 --> 01:02:57,895
Yeah. Her and every
other woman in New York.

1604
01:02:57,963 --> 01:02:59,555
Taxi!

1605
01:02:59,764 --> 01:03:03,393
So common, so typical,
so similar!

1606
01:03:03,468 --> 01:03:06,130
You men are so similar
in your mediocrity.

1607
01:03:06,204 --> 01:03:08,195
You're like a pack
of Philistines!

1608
01:03:08,273 --> 01:03:11,106
These matches
are disappointing me!

1609
01:03:11,176 --> 01:03:12,609
Here you go, baby.

1610
01:03:12,677 --> 01:03:15,612
I can't be babied,
but thank you.

1611
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,612
You see what I did?

1612
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:18,116
I said thank you.
That's courtesy.

1613
01:03:18,249 --> 01:03:20,717
And courtesy and manners
are what women know.

1614
01:03:20,785 --> 01:03:22,412
Men, you get into
a relationship,

1615
01:03:22,487 --> 01:03:24,079
and the woman is so willing

1616
01:03:24,155 --> 01:03:26,919
to sublimate her needs
to guide her man

1617
01:03:26,991 --> 01:03:30,222
through the important
signposts of life, lovingly.

1618
01:03:30,294 --> 01:03:31,727
Very lovingly.

1619
01:03:31,796 --> 01:03:34,663
And then you turn your back
for 24 hours

1620
01:03:34,732 --> 01:03:36,666
and you go into a public restroom,

1621
01:03:36,734 --> 01:03:39,760
and there he is,
making out with another woman!

1622
01:03:39,837 --> 01:03:41,498
Do you see what I'm saying?

1623
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:42,698
Oh, I feel you.

1624
01:03:42,773 --> 01:03:45,833
And who do I have to blame?
I have myself to blame

1625
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:48,344
because I've dated enough
narcissistically neurotic men

1626
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:52,371
to know that you are all
just a pack of roaming babies

1627
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:54,145
in search of a giant teat

1628
01:03:54,218 --> 01:03:57,119
from which to suck
the life blood out of me

1629
01:03:57,188 --> 01:03:58,849
until I'm a hollow shell.

1630
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:01,523
What?

1631
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:03,389
Well, baby,
all this talk about teats

1632
01:04:03,461 --> 01:04:05,122
just made me think I
should say something.

1633
01:04:05,196 --> 01:04:07,130
Uh, I'm sensing
a lot of hostility

1634
01:04:07,198 --> 01:04:08,392
coming from the back seat.

1635
01:04:08,466 --> 01:04:10,627
Oh, really?
That's very astute.

1636
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:11,861
Well, that's not good
for me, man.

1637
01:04:11,936 --> 01:04:13,369
That kind of energy

1638
01:04:13,437 --> 01:04:15,405
damages the plush interior
of my cab, right?

1639
01:04:15,473 --> 01:04:18,135
And you're blowing
a $5.00 high, mama.

1640
01:04:18,209 --> 01:04:19,676
You need to find yourself a man

1641
01:04:19,744 --> 01:04:21,871
who's secure enough
to appreciate you

1642
01:04:21,946 --> 01:04:24,506
for the superior woman
that you are.

1643
01:04:24,582 --> 01:04:25,913
I like a strong woman.

1644
01:04:25,983 --> 01:04:27,644
Oh... yeah. Mm-hmm.

1645
01:04:27,718 --> 01:04:29,583
And you are a strong woman.

1646
01:04:29,654 --> 01:04:31,918
If I was you,
I would pull over with me

1647
01:04:31,989 --> 01:04:33,422
and celebrate
our strength together.

1648
01:04:33,491 --> 01:04:35,789
What do you think
about that, baby?

1649
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,293
This corner's great.

1650
01:04:37,361 --> 01:04:39,693
This corner's fantastic for me.

1651
01:04:39,764 --> 01:04:41,163
Well, let's do that.
I didn't know you wanted

1652
01:04:41,232 --> 01:04:43,097
to pull over so soon,
but I'll tell you what,

1653
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,725
do you wanna make slow,
passionate love,

1654
01:04:44,802 --> 01:04:46,167
or should I leave
the meter running?

1655
01:04:46,237 --> 01:04:47,727
Baby? Baby?

1656
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,805
Baby actually left.

1657
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:53,343
Mm, mm, mm.

1658
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:56,005
Now, let me see.
Did I smile?

1659
01:04:57,381 --> 01:04:59,281
I must not have smiled.
That's what it was.

1660
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,375
Bridget: That was
a total waste of time.

1661
01:05:01,452 --> 01:05:04,387
Really, law school.
That is so yuppie.

1662
01:05:04,455 --> 01:05:05,547
Do you believe him going on

1663
01:05:05,623 --> 01:05:06,715
about real estate all night?

1664
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:07,951
What is it with guys

1665
01:05:08,025 --> 01:05:09,390
where they think you give a shit
about their stuff?

1666
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:10,484
Oh! There he is.

1667
01:05:11,896 --> 01:05:14,831
Bridget: You think this is too mean
ditching him this way?

1668
01:05:17,568 --> 01:05:21,004
Caitlyn: Please,
the law school thing is bad enough,

1669
01:05:21,072 --> 01:05:23,939
but what's with the cowboy shirt
and the gladiator hair?

1670
01:05:24,008 --> 01:05:25,475
Bridget: Really.

1671
01:05:25,543 --> 01:05:28,068
Oh, and you might want
to try a new approach.

1672
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:29,544
This whole thing
with the matchbooks

1673
01:05:29,614 --> 01:05:30,603
is so predictable.

1674
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:32,581
What do you expect?
I'm under a deadline.

1675
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:34,413
What time is it anyway?

1676
01:05:35,486 --> 01:05:36,919
Oh, my God.

1677
01:05:36,988 --> 01:05:37,920
- What?
- We've got an hour.

1678
01:05:37,989 --> 01:05:39,422
An hour? Are you serious?

1679
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:40,422
Come on!

1680
01:05:40,491 --> 01:05:41,389
Wait a minute.

1681
01:05:44,462 --> 01:05:45,895
The last thing...

1682
01:05:45,963 --> 01:05:47,430
The last day of 1981.

1683
01:05:47,498 --> 01:05:49,363
? I don't care?

1684
01:05:51,535 --> 01:05:52,524
? I don't care?

1685
01:05:52,603 --> 01:05:54,628
? We don't care?

1686
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:56,229
? I don't care?

1687
01:05:56,307 --> 01:05:58,207
? About this world?

1688
01:05:58,276 --> 01:05:59,538
? I don't care?

1689
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:01,976
? About that girl?

1690
01:06:02,046 --> 01:06:03,707
? I don't care??

Oh, yeah. That's good.

Oh, that's so good.

[Monica Whimpers]

1695
01:06:29,974 --> 01:06:31,908
You see,
it's all in the technique.

1696
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:35,742
Most people,
they underestimate the importance

1697
01:06:35,813 --> 01:06:37,405
of the rotational thrust.

1698
01:06:38,983 --> 01:06:40,610
Eric, you're hurting my skin.

1699
01:06:40,685 --> 01:06:42,346
Well, that's just great!

1700
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:43,352
Ow!

1701
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:44,854
You know,
I don't think I'm the one

1702
01:06:44,922 --> 01:06:46,082
with the problem here,
Monica.

1703
01:06:46,157 --> 01:06:47,215
I think it's you.

1704
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:49,020
I think you're blaming me
for being bad in bed

1705
01:06:49,093 --> 01:06:51,857
because you're clearly stunted
in some way physically.

1706
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:54,420
It's not my fault you're
an emotional cripple.

1707
01:06:54,498 --> 01:06:57,331
Well, that's so typical
of a woman.

1708
01:06:57,401 --> 01:07:00,393
It's all about emotions
and intimacy...

1709
01:07:00,471 --> 01:07:03,872
and feelings and all that
vague ambiguous bullshit!

1710
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:06,273
It's sex. That's it!

1711
01:07:06,344 --> 01:07:09,040
Two people in a bed getting off!

1712
01:07:09,113 --> 01:07:13,015
Not some ethereal thing
out there to embrace humanity.

1713
01:07:13,084 --> 01:07:16,144
Look, you wanted to know
why you were bad in bed,

1714
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,346
and I told you.

1715
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:18,945
You don't have to bite
my head off

1716
01:07:19,023 --> 01:07:20,422
just because you're inadequate.

1717
01:07:20,491 --> 01:07:22,721
Oh, now I'm inadequate.

1718
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:23,725
Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

1721
01:07:26,397 --> 01:07:29,730
Well, you just take
that god-awful dress off,

1722
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,529
and I'll show you
who's adequate, honey.

1723
01:07:33,871 --> 01:07:35,270
What are you doing?

1724
01:07:35,339 --> 01:07:38,035
I'm gonna prove you wrong.
That's right.

1725

I'm gonna have you
on your hands and knees

It's a free country.

1757

Well, did Val say something
to you about me?

1758
01:09:00,991 --> 01:09:02,891
Because I thought we were
really hitting if off there

1759
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:03,949
for a while.

1760
01:09:04,028 --> 01:09:05,928
I mean, it felt like
she really liked me,

1761
01:09:05,996 --> 01:09:10,262
you know, and, now she's
in there making out with Dave,

01:09:10,334 --> 01:09:12,427
and I'm just wondering,
I mean,

1763
01:09:12,503 --> 01:09:14,937
did I do something to offend her?

1764

It's like when I first met Val,
though, you know,

01:09:23,514 --> 01:09:25,573
I was like... whoa!
This is the one!

1768
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:27,947
This is the one.
Because the thing with Val is,

1769
01:09:28,018 --> 01:09:29,246
you know, she's different.

1770
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:32,289
I mean, she's just
like this little girl,

01:09:32,356 --> 01:09:33,380
and l, you know,

1772
01:09:33,457 --> 01:09:34,822
I wanted to, like,
I wanted to get near her,

1773
01:09:34,892 --> 01:09:36,120
and I wanted to be with her,

1774
01:09:36,193 --> 01:09:39,162
you know, her big eyes,
her big, round head, you know.

1775
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:42,393
I just thought maybe, you know,
I was falling in...

1776
01:09:42,466 --> 01:09:44,400
I mean, you know,
maybe this is...

1777
01:09:45,603 --> 01:09:47,901
I don't know. I mean...

1778
01:09:47,972 --> 01:09:50,566
All right, you probably think
it's really jerky, huh?

1779
01:09:50,641 --> 01:09:54,577
Sayin' somethin'
'cause I just met her.

Look, can I tell you
something here?

1781
01:09:56,514 --> 01:09:59,881

the worst night of my life, OK?

01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:02,418
I mean, I'm standing here
in a basement

1783
01:10:02,486 --> 01:10:03,680
on fucking Avenue D,

1784
01:10:03,754 --> 01:10:05,415
so I'm sorry if you're
having troubles

1785
01:10:05,489 --> 01:10:07,514
finding the right girl
and everything.

1786
01:10:07,591 --> 01:10:09,422
But I'm just trying
to get the fuck home

1787
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:11,290
before somebody kills me,
all right?

1788
01:10:11,362 --> 01:10:14,092
All right.

1789

Yeah, I can see that. Yeah.

1790

? Please?

1791
01:10:21,705 --> 01:10:24,833
? Don't let this feeling end?

1792
01:10:24,909 --> 01:10:28,276
? It may not come again?

1793
01:10:28,345 --> 01:10:33,942
? And I want to remember?

1794

? How it feels to touch you?

1795
01:10:40,658 --> 01:10:45,652
? How I feel so much?

1796

? Since I found you?

? Looking through
the eyes of love??

I got you some flowers.

Uh, mind if I sit down?

1800

I'm with someone.

What, the bartender?

1805
01:11:30,974 --> 01:11:31,998
He's in the bathroom.

1806
01:11:32,075 --> 01:11:33,372
He's going to be right back.

1807
01:11:33,443 --> 01:11:35,468
You know what?
You should just go home.

1808
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:36,478
That's what you wanted to do.

1809

'cause I'm set for the night.

1812

Look, you just met this guy.

1813
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:46,121
So?

1814
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:47,122
So don't you think

1815
01:11:47,191 --> 01:11:48,123
it seems a little sudden

1816
01:11:48,192 --> 01:11:49,124
or something to be...

1817
01:11:49,193 --> 01:11:50,387
You are much

- Fine. All right.

1820
01:11:54,665 --> 01:11:56,724
You want to throw yourself at some guy
you just met, it's your business.

1821
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,700
I'm going home.

The thing is... What l...

I think we should do it.

1835

You've got to be kidding.

1836

I'm serious.
I think we should

1837
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:23,617
go back to the coffee shop

1838
01:12:23,694 --> 01:12:26,561
and... just... do it.

What do you say?
Come on. You in?

You know what?
I can't just leave the bartender.

Do you mean to tell me

she actually broke up with you

1854

You would make
a wonderful artist's model.

Can I get you another drink?

Hillary, you should
come down to the studio

I'm not speaking to you, Jack.

01:16:14,124 --> 01:16:16,684
292 Great Jones Street.

1948
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,784
Oh, you know, baby,

1949
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:19,385
you better tell me that
when we get moving.

1950
01:16:19,463 --> 01:16:20,521
I'm a little intoxicated.

1951
01:16:20,597 --> 01:16:22,656
It's New Year's Eve. Ha ha.

1952
01:16:22,732 --> 01:16:23,926
I can't believe
that you are so hard up

1953
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,331
that you'd go for that lawyer.

1954
01:16:25,402 --> 01:16:26,391
I suppose now you want him

1955
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,801
for yourself, huh?

1956
01:16:27,871 --> 01:16:29,600
You are so paranoid.

1957
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:31,265
Or maybe you want
Eric and the lawyer.

1958
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:32,865
Is that it?

1959
01:16:32,943 --> 01:16:34,103
Hey, hey.

1960
01:16:34,177 --> 01:16:36,111
Please... Please don't touch me.

1961
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:37,305
Too much hostility.

1962
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,938
Can you just get the car to move?

1963
01:16:39,015 --> 01:16:40,346
You know, baby,
in life, sometimes

1964
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:43,352
you got to stay still
to move forward.

1965
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,115
What?

1966
01:16:45,188 --> 01:16:46,849
Would you like a cigarette?

1967
01:16:46,923 --> 01:16:47,912
Yeah.

1968
01:16:47,991 --> 01:16:49,151
Yeah, come on.

1969
01:16:49,226 --> 01:16:50,158
Here you go.

1970
01:16:52,028 --> 01:16:53,188
You know, this song

1971
01:16:53,263 --> 01:16:54,730
always reminds me

1972
01:16:54,798 --> 01:16:57,426
of me and my buddy Twain.

1973
01:16:57,501 --> 01:17:00,129
Twain was my best friend
a few years back,

1974
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:02,330
till we fell in love
with the same girl.

1975
01:17:02,405 --> 01:17:05,169
Mmm. Pretty girl. Foxy.

1976
01:17:05,242 --> 01:17:07,642
Anyway, Twain
was the smooth one.

1977
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,178
You know, I was a shy
little knuckle-head kid.

1978
01:17:09,246 --> 01:17:10,645
I had no Afro back then,

1979
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:11,646
so, you know, I wasn't...

1980
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:13,080
wasn't smooth.

1981
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:16,415
Anyway, one night
I went to a restaurant,

1982
01:17:16,486 --> 01:17:18,784
bump into Twain
and the girl of my dreams

1983
01:17:18,855 --> 01:17:20,379
eating dinner.

1984
01:17:20,457 --> 01:17:21,424
I sat in the back
of the restaurant

1985
01:17:21,491 --> 01:17:22,423
and watched them eat dinner

1986
01:17:22,492 --> 01:17:23,789
all goddamn night.

1987
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:26,055
First they had
a little finger food,

1988
01:17:26,129 --> 01:17:28,359
wine, cheese, the whole thing,

1989
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:29,625
and the whole time
I'm sitting over there,

1990
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:32,691
I said,
I wish that that was me.

1991
01:17:32,769 --> 01:17:34,566
Next thing I know,

1992
01:17:34,638 --> 01:17:35,764
Twain bite into a string bean

1993
01:17:35,839 --> 01:17:36,863
and choked to death

1994
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:38,032
right in the middle

1995
01:17:38,108 --> 01:17:40,042
of the goddamn restaurant.

1996
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,543
Mmm. Hmm.

1997
01:17:41,611 --> 01:17:42,737
I always thought,
it could've been me.

1998
01:17:42,812 --> 01:17:44,871
It should've been me.

1999
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:46,711
This song always make me
think about that.

2000
01:17:46,783 --> 01:17:48,011
Mmm.

2001
01:17:48,084 --> 01:17:50,211
Silky ho.
I'll never forget her.

2002
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:52,812
So what are you saying,
love kills?

2003
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:55,414
No.

2004
01:17:56,493 --> 01:17:57,460
He's saying we shouldn't fight

2005
01:17:57,527 --> 01:17:58,892
about these guys,

2006
01:17:58,962 --> 01:18:01,226
and personally,
I think he's right.

2007
01:18:01,298 --> 01:18:02,458
Oh, I know I'm right, baby.

2008
01:18:02,532 --> 01:18:03,464
What if, for the sake

2009
01:18:03,533 --> 01:18:04,465
of our friendship,
we just decided

2010
01:18:04,534 --> 01:18:06,661
to leave the party
alone tonight?

2011
01:18:06,736 --> 01:18:08,897
[Laughs]

2012
01:18:08,972 --> 01:18:10,098
You...

2013
01:18:10,173 --> 01:18:11,936
you mean no guys at all?

2014
01:18:12,008 --> 01:18:13,669
That sounds much better,
doesn't it?

2015
01:18:13,743 --> 01:18:15,438
Uh-huh.

2016
01:18:15,512 --> 01:18:16,672
You mean, we go home alone,

2017
01:18:16,746 --> 01:18:17,713
no guys at all,

2018

even if it means we get jinxed

2019
01:18:18,815 --> 01:18:21,010
for the whole year?

2020
01:18:22,085 --> 01:18:23,074
That's the kind of sacrifice

2021
01:18:23,153 --> 01:18:26,247
I'm willing to make
for our friendship.

in this cab right now

is beautiful.

2029

It's beautiful.

2030
01:18:41,504 --> 01:18:42,869
Is there any way that you can

2031
01:18:42,939 --> 01:18:45,237
get this car to just move?

2032
01:18:45,308 --> 01:18:46,502
Is there any way
you can get out the car

2033
01:18:46,576 --> 01:18:49,246
and, uh,
move that truck for me?

Kevin, don't. Don't.

I don't know.

I just...
I opened my eyes, and l...

2041
01:19:11,301 --> 01:19:12,768
and I saw your face,

2042

and I realized

2043
01:19:14,571 --> 01:19:16,129
I can't do this.

2044
01:19:16,206 --> 01:19:17,138
What?

2045
01:19:17,207 --> 01:19:18,504
You just saw my face

2046
01:19:18,575 --> 01:19:20,509
and realized you can't
have sex with me?

2047

I can't go on forever

having sex with people

2049
01:19:23,513 --> 01:19:25,174
who don't care about me.

Yeah,

01:19:31,621 --> 01:19:33,418
I did.

So all the years of empty,

you can't do it anymore?

01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:47,074
Mmm. Do you believe

2279
01:28:47,142 --> 01:28:49,667
that lawyer-bartender guy
showed up?

2280
01:28:49,744 --> 01:28:50,802
He wasn't so bad.

2281
01:28:50,879 --> 01:28:51,846
I mean, he was really nice

2282
01:28:51,913 --> 01:28:53,175
about us ditching him
and all that.

2283
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,476
Are you crazy?

2284
01:28:54,549 --> 01:28:56,210
What a disappointing party.

2285
01:28:56,284 --> 01:28:58,309
Those guys were such total posers.

2286
01:28:58,386 --> 01:29:00,115
I'm so glad we decided
to go home alone.

2287
01:29:00,188 --> 01:29:01,519
Oh.

2288
01:29:01,589 --> 01:29:02,886
Want to go for breakfast?

2289
01:29:02,957 --> 01:29:05,517
Um...

2290
01:29:05,593 --> 01:29:08,153
No. Maybe lunch?

2291
01:29:08,229 --> 01:29:09,287
Oh.

2292
01:29:09,364 --> 01:29:10,763
I got to go.

2293
01:29:10,832 --> 01:29:12,959
? Give it to me, baby?

2294
01:29:14,936 --> 01:29:17,427
Hey.

2295
01:29:17,505 --> 01:29:19,370
Guess who reloaded, baby.

2296
01:29:19,441 --> 01:29:21,033
? Give it to me
Give it to me?

2297
01:29:21,109 --> 01:29:22,667
? Give it to me
Give it to me?

2298
01:29:22,744 --> 01:29:24,268
? Give me your stuff
that sweet...??

2299
01:29:24,346 --> 01:29:25,813
I mean,

2300
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,006
at least they showed up,

2301
01:29:27,082 --> 01:29:28,549
right? I mean,

2302
01:29:28,616 --> 01:29:29,810
at least I don't have to spend

2303
01:29:29,884 --> 01:29:30,816
the rest of my life

2304
01:29:30,885 --> 01:29:31,977
thinking I have no friends

2305
01:29:32,053 --> 01:29:33,680
and everybody hates me.

2306
01:29:33,755 --> 01:29:36,053
Right?
That's something, right?

2307
01:29:36,124 --> 01:29:37,853
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2308
01:29:37,926 --> 01:29:39,291
Listen, do you got
any Alka-Seltzer?

2309
01:29:39,361 --> 01:29:40,589
I got to meet this guy Tony

2310
01:29:40,662 --> 01:29:42,061
for breakfast.

2311
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:43,688
It's in the bathroom.

2312
01:29:43,765 --> 01:29:45,289
Thanks.

2313
01:29:55,844 --> 01:29:57,539
[Gasps]

2314
01:29:59,013 --> 01:30:00,446
Ohh.

2315
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:04,480
Ohh.

2316
01:30:04,552 --> 01:30:07,077
Mmm.

2317
01:30:15,597 --> 01:30:17,531
[Groans]

2318
01:30:20,101 --> 01:30:22,262
Oh, God.

2319
01:30:24,272 --> 01:30:26,502
Where are my fucking glasses?

2320
01:30:26,574 --> 01:30:29,737
Oh, no. Not again.

2321
01:30:29,811 --> 01:30:30,743
Elvis?

2322
01:30:30,812 --> 01:30:31,744
[Coughs]

2323
01:30:31,813 --> 01:30:33,371
[Gasps]

2324
01:30:33,448 --> 01:30:36,042
[Laughs]

2325
01:30:46,895 --> 01:30:49,056
All right.

2326
01:30:52,867 --> 01:30:56,166
So, uh, can I call you later?

2327
01:30:56,237 --> 01:30:59,070
You mean, like, later today?

2328
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:00,107
Uh, yeah, unless...

2329
01:31:00,175 --> 01:31:01,267
unless you think that's too jerky.

2330
01:31:01,342 --> 01:31:02,502
Is that too jerky or something?

2331
01:31:02,577 --> 01:31:03,601
No. No,

2332
01:31:03,678 --> 01:31:04,804
I don't think it's too jerky.

2333
01:31:04,879 --> 01:31:06,312
You don't?

2334
01:31:06,381 --> 01:31:08,849
Uh-uh.

2335
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:12,353
OK, good. You know, uh,

2336
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:13,910
because,

2337
01:31:13,988 --> 01:31:16,456
you know, l... I really
like you a lot,

2338
01:31:16,524 --> 01:31:17,456
you know, as,

2339
01:31:17,525 --> 01:31:20,187
like, I like you a lot.

2340
01:31:20,261 --> 01:31:21,193
You do?

2341
01:31:21,262 --> 01:31:22,194
Yeah.

2342
01:31:23,765 --> 01:31:24,789
I mean, I don't think
that you need

2343
01:31:24,866 --> 01:31:26,390
a lot of time to know
something like that.

2344
01:31:26,468 --> 01:31:27,833
You know, you just...

2345
01:31:27,902 --> 01:31:29,096
You know, when you know it,

2346
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:31,502
you know, when it happens,
you know it,

2347
01:31:31,573 --> 01:31:33,268
and I know it.

2348
01:31:33,341 --> 01:31:34,308
You know what I mean?

2349
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:35,342
Yeah.

2350
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:37,344
Yeah. So do I.

2351
01:31:43,485 --> 01:31:45,112
So...

2352
01:31:45,186 --> 01:31:47,086
we should go
to dinner tonight?

2353
01:31:47,155 --> 01:31:48,383
You want to?

2354
01:31:48,456 --> 01:31:50,014
OK.

2355
01:32:05,773 --> 01:32:08,640
You're going to think
this is crazy, but...

2356
01:32:09,944 --> 01:32:12,003
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

2357
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,742
[Laughs]

2358
01:32:14,816 --> 01:32:16,147
l...

2359
01:32:16,217 --> 01:32:18,811
No, I don't think
you're crazy.

2360
01:32:34,068 --> 01:32:35,729
[Sniffs]

2361
01:32:35,803 --> 01:32:37,771
Hey, man, you smell dog shit?

2362
01:32:44,312 --> 01:32:45,711
Did you know that cigarettes

2363
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:47,611
are a shield against
meaningful interaction

2364
01:32:47,682 --> 01:32:49,673
with other people?

2365
01:32:51,953 --> 01:32:54,319
It's true. I read it.

2366
01:32:55,723 --> 01:32:58,248
People protect themselves
emotionally

2367
01:32:58,326 --> 01:32:59,759
by relating to their cigarettes

2368
01:32:59,827 --> 01:33:01,624
instead of each other.

2369
01:33:06,067 --> 01:33:07,193
That's what struck me last night

2370
01:33:07,268 --> 01:33:08,200
watching all those people

2371
01:33:08,269 --> 01:33:09,702
standing around
with their cigarettes.

2372
01:33:09,771 --> 01:33:11,102
Why is everyone so afraid?

2373
01:33:11,172 --> 01:33:12,935
Why are people so scared
of each other?

2374
01:33:13,007 --> 01:33:13,974
Like us?

2375
01:33:14,042 --> 01:33:15,441
No. We've never been anything

2376
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:17,603
but totally honest
with each other.

2377
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:19,044
Them.

2378
01:33:20,114 --> 01:33:23,345
? More than this?

2379
01:33:23,418 --> 01:33:27,479
? You know there's nothing?

2380
01:33:27,555 --> 01:33:30,456
? More than this??

2381
01:33:30,525 --> 01:33:33,050
Anyway, I think it's time
to quit smoking.

2382
01:33:33,127 --> 01:33:34,754
Mm-hmmm.

2383
01:33:34,829 --> 01:33:36,592
? More than this?

2384
01:33:36,664 --> 01:33:38,063
Lucy:
So then you'll get grumpy

2385
01:33:38,132 --> 01:33:39,292
and cranky and fat,

2386
01:33:39,367 --> 01:33:41,028
and you'll whine,
and you'll bitch,

2387
01:33:41,102 --> 01:33:42,967
and you'll lose
all your inspiration,

2388
01:33:43,037 --> 01:33:45,106
and you're gonna blame me.

2389
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:45,762
Cabbie:
Although I went

2390
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,467
to a crazy
New Year's Eve party,

2391
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:49,236
after I put the cab up, I mean.

2392
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:50,675
I got pictures. Look here.

2393
01:33:50,744 --> 01:33:52,541
Now these two girls
in this picture,

2394
01:33:52,613 --> 01:33:54,410
oh, I couldn't understand
a damn thing they said,

2395
01:33:54,482 --> 01:33:57,110
a-and where in the hell
is Ronkokomano?

2396
01:33:57,184 --> 01:33:58,116
Now this guy here,

2397
01:33:58,185 --> 01:33:59,209
he's a famous necrophiliac

2398
01:33:59,286 --> 01:34:00,253
with a album.

2399
01:34:00,321 --> 01:34:01,345
He kept dragging a dead girl

2400
01:34:01,422 --> 01:34:03,049
around the party.
It was real weird.

2401
01:34:03,124 --> 01:34:04,182
Look at his eyes, man.
He crazy.

2402
01:34:04,258 --> 01:34:05,987
Look at her.
Dead, dead, dead.

2403
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:07,254
This dude right here I call,

2404
01:34:07,328 --> 01:34:08,659
vagina puppet man,

2405
01:34:08,729 --> 01:34:10,060
'cause he kept
making vagina puppets

2406
01:34:10,131 --> 01:34:11,063
with his hands,

2407
01:34:11,132 --> 01:34:12,224
but he's a real talented fella.

2408
01:34:12,299 --> 01:34:14,028
I mean, I see big things
in his future,

2409
01:34:14,101 --> 01:34:16,194
'cause there's a market
for vaginas.

2410
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:17,328
Oh, this girl right here

2411
01:34:17,404 --> 01:34:18,871
keeps feeding people
little weenies,

2412
01:34:18,939 --> 01:34:20,531
but I think she want
a weenie herself,

2413
01:34:20,608 --> 01:34:21,802
if you know what I'm saying.

2414
01:34:21,876 --> 01:34:23,241
Uh, now this little girl here,

2415
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:24,436
I picked her up
earlier that night, too.

2416
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:26,002
It's a small city, ain't it?

2417
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,638
That must be the guy
she was telling me

2418
01:34:27,715 --> 01:34:29,307
she was so nervous
about being with.

2419
01:34:29,383 --> 01:34:30,714
Just when he started
making a little headway,

2420
01:34:30,784 --> 01:34:31,716
wouldn't you know,

2421
01:34:31,785 --> 01:34:32,774
one of the ugliest bitches

2422
01:34:32,853 --> 01:34:34,753
I've ever seen
in my life rolled up,

2423
01:34:34,822 --> 01:34:36,380
and I'm not one
to call women ugly,

2424
01:34:36,457 --> 01:34:37,583
but I think this woman was,

2425
01:34:37,658 --> 01:34:39,853
because she had a penis.

2426
01:34:39,927 --> 01:34:40,951
Oh, there's Dutch boy

2427
01:34:41,028 --> 01:34:42,996
with, uh, the girl
from, Rankakomano.

2428
01:34:43,063 --> 01:34:44,121
I ain't going
to call her young,

2429
01:34:44,198 --> 01:34:45,187
but I'm going to tell you this,

2430
01:34:45,266 --> 01:34:46,392
I bet you she write
a couple love letters

2431
01:34:46,467 --> 01:34:47,866
in crayons here and there.

2432
01:34:47,935 --> 01:34:49,425
There I go. There I go.

2433
01:34:49,503 --> 01:34:50,435
I'm having fun right here.

2434
01:34:50,504 --> 01:34:51,436
Almost having fun,

2435
01:34:51,505 --> 01:34:52,767
and here go my man right here.

2436
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,000
Remember him?
This guy would not

2437
01:34:54,074 --> 01:34:55,006
listen to me, man.

2438
01:34:55,075 --> 01:34:56,133
He got 2 girls,

2439
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:57,575
don't know what to do
with either of them.

2440
01:34:57,645 --> 01:34:58,577
You see, big girl right here

2441
01:34:58,646 --> 01:34:59,578
