3
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,413
(bell tolling )

4
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,525
( tolling continues )

5
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,291
( indistinct voices
and applause )

6
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,627
MAN ( with German accent ):
Time.

7
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:06,691
Time, it has been proposed

8
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,464
is the fourth dimension.

9
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:14,237
And yet, for mortal man,
time has no dimension at all.

10
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:16,937
We are like horses
with blinders

11
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:19,880
seeing only
what lies before us.

12
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:21,041
Hear, hear.

13
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,541
Forever guessing the future

14
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:26,384
and fabricating the past.

15
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:27,387
( applause )

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,514
-It's him.
Who?

17
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:29,524
Brilliant.

18
00:01:29,558 --> 00:01:31,389
Quite right, Your Grace.

19
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,020
How, you ask, can we lift

20
00:01:34,063 --> 00:01:37,191
these shackles and live--
not in the moment

21
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:43,002
but in the glorious expanse
of time's continuum?

22
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,233
( groaning )

23
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:48,108
Listen, and I shall tell you.

24
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:53,582
The secret lies in the enduring
power of our achievements

25
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:55,380
our creations!

26
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:58,285
( applause )

27
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:01,779
As the pyramids testify
to the Egyptians

28
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:05,523
so my glorious erection
shall represent

29
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:08,964
our culture in perpetuity.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,264
Behold, rising before you

31
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:14,794
the greatest erection
on the continent.

32
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:16,329
( laughs )

33
00:02:16,374 --> 00:02:18,467
The greatest erection
of the age!

34
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,807
( laughing continues )

35
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:22,779
The greatest erection
on the planet!

36
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:23,802
( applause )

37
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:26,146
( marching band playing )

38
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:31,383
Hold this.

39
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:33,048
Of course.

40
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:40,096
For the Herald, Your Grace.

41
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:41,656
I understand
you'll be making

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,600
an important announcement
tonight.

43
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:53,409
Good afternoon, ladies.
Please, excuse me, please.

44
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:55,174
Good afternoon.

45
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,645
( horse neighing )

46
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:11,521
( horse snorts )

47
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,468
MAN:
And the Perrier-Jouet
should be chilled.

48
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:16,992
-You understand? Chilled.
-Yes, sir.

49
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:18,368
Leopold!

50
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:20,805
Leopold, where have you been?

51
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:22,365
Leopold!

52
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:24,502
Otis, I demand explication!

53
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,945
It's half past 5:00!
He's not even dressed!

54
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:28,539
He'll be ready, my lord.
I assure you.

55
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,949
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!

56
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:34,250
Ah, Miss Blaine.

57
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:36,188
You dance like a...

58
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,384
like a herd of cattle.

59
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:40,688
You are a rare woman

60
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:44,221
who lights up a room
simply by leaving it.

61
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,256
Might you be rich,
Miss Blaine?

62
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,531
You see, whilst l
am the third Duke

63
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,835
the little secret of those
of us in the Royal Court--

64
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:54,034
apart from our
general uselessness--

65
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:55,906
i i
s our massve
indebtedness.

66
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,504
It's always been
your misfortune, Leopold

67
00:03:58,546 --> 00:04:00,844
that you so thoroughly
amuse yourself

68
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:02,748
with the sound
of your own voice.

69
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,582
In a life as stagnant as mine

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,485
that I can amuse myself at all

71
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:08,149
is an evolutionary marvel.

72
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,804
Hmm.

73
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,534
Please don't touch that.

74
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:18,099
The device you were
jabbering about.

75
00:04:18,143 --> 00:04:20,543
To take priests
to the bell tower.

76
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,343
To take anyone, Uncle, to
the floor they so desire.

77
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:24,849
Buildings continue to climb.

78
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:27,409
Soon they will outstrip
the stamina of our legs.

79
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:30,446
You speak of progress
and invention.

80
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:33,424
Yet what I offer you downstairs
is reality.

81
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,452
Take a wife. Marry.

82
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:37,724
Marriage...

83
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:40,358
marriage is the promise
of eternal love.

84
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,664
As a man of honor, I can
not promise eternally

85
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:44,431
what I have never
felt momentarily.

86
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:48,237
Born into privilege,
yet perversely ashamed of it.

87
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:49,799
That is your tragedy.

88
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:50,970
My God! If my brother

89
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:53,206
could only see you,
he'd be heartbroken.

90
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:54,214
You are no duke!

91
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:55,340
Of course I'm not.

92
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,111
The monarchy is dead, Uncle.

93
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:59,016
We are relics.
That is reality.

94
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:00,714
The new Royals are men
of accomplishment.

95
00:05:00,755 --> 00:05:02,120
Men like Roebling,
with his bridge

96
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:03,817
Edison, with his lamp

97
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:06,349
Diesel, Bell, Westinghouse...

98
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,418
Those men made themselves
from nothing!

99
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:12,625
You, on the other hand,
were born with everything

100
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,864
and from it,
fashioned nothing.

101
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:19,499
As of tonight,
I wash my hands of you.

102
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,111
Take a good look
at your dance card, Leopold.

103
00:05:25,147 --> 00:05:28,446
A wealthy bride
is your only surety.

104
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,383
( waltz playing )

105
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,935
Your Grace,
may I present Miss Tree

106
00:05:50,973 --> 00:05:52,041
of the Trees
of Schenectady, sir.

107
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,440
of the Trees
of Schenectady, sir.

108
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,514
Miss Tree?

109
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,782
It's an honor to be making

110
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:06,314
your royal acquaintance,
Your Highness.

111
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,930
( clears throat softly )

112
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:13,455
Shall we?

113
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,918
# #

114
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,766
( click )

115
00:06:57,045 --> 00:07:00,412
( waltz continues )

116
00:07:04,753 --> 00:07:07,085
( clicking, winding )

117
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,385
( clicking, winding )

118
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:16,094
Many dreams, all useless.

119
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,430
( clattering )

120
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:32,980
Who are you?

121
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,042
Uh...

122
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,017
No, no, no.

123
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:41,490
Okay, rela...

124
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:43,322
Please, wait, no.

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,759
I don't want to harm you.

126
00:07:44,795 --> 00:07:45,762
Stop! Please!

127
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:47,661
Sir, wait!

128
00:07:50,634 --> 00:07:53,102
Pardon me. Pardon me.

129
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:54,502
( horse snorts )

130
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:56,950
Go! Go!

131
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:57,220
Ya!

132
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,119
Ya!

133
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,757
( neighing )

134
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:08,399
( snorting )

135
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,388
( snorting )

136
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:13,228
( neighing )

137
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:15,867
Ya!

138
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:33,286
( thunder crashes )

139
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,808
# #

140
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:13,292
Stop, sir! Please!

141
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,696
( thunder crashes )

142
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:30,743
Oh, my God.

143
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:46,262
No!

144
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:47,662
Oh!

145
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:48,790
Let go!

146
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,768
Just let go. It's okay!

147
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,833
You don't understand!
Let go!

148
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,343
( bell tolling )

149
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,676
Oh!

150
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,248
I don't want to hurt you!
Let go!

151
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:05,272
Goddamn it!

152
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,410
( yells )

153
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,848
Whoa, whoa...

154
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:13,722
( both yelling )

155
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,187
( thunder rolling )

156
00:10:16,228 --> 00:10:18,253
( beeping )

157
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:26,567
( elevator groans to a halt )

158
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:30,500
Oh...

159
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,171
( electronic crackling )

160
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:35,646
( elevator restarts )

161
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:41,485
( bell dings )

162
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,161
( sighs )

163
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:05,899
( dog barking )

164
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,771
( thumping )

165
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,274
( barking continues )

166
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,402
MAN :
Bart!

167
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:13,572
( thumping continues )

168
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:18,346
( barking continues )

169
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,944
MAN :
Wait!

170
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:30,060
( barking )

171
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:32,965
MAN :
Shit! Ow!

172
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:35,993
( groans )

173
00:11:37,806 --> 00:11:40,104
( dog barking )

174
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,904
Oh, my God.

175
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:45,641
( barking continues )

176
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:55,021
( barks )

177
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:57,026
We must remember, Bart

178
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,827
that sometimes it is okay
to color outside the lines.

179
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:09,468
( phone rings )

180
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:10,767
Hello?

181
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,775
My Palm Pilot.
You still have it.

182
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:14,242
Kate, it's 1 :00 in the morning.

183
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:16,439
And clearly you're awake,
so what is the infraction?

184
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,607
Look, Kate, I don't know
where your Palm Pilot is.

185
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:22,551
And I can't do this right now.
Not now. I'm expecting a call.

186
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:23,883
( gasps )

187
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:36,492
( dog barking )

188
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:39,469
( high-pitched beep )

189
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,335
( Bart yelping )

190
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:42,340
Oh, Bart.

191
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:44,069
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

192
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:48,471
She is not a happy person.

193
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:49,571
( high-pitched beep )

194
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:50,842
( yells )

195
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:54,508
Goddamn it!

196
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:55,541
( groans )

197
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:59,546
( phone ringing )

198
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:01,422
You know what, Stuart?
You know what? I'm...

199
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:02,426
Kate...

200
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,587
Stuart...?

201
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,153
Please. I've got
somebody here, okay?

202
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:06,664
I know. I saw her.

203
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:07,666
No, you didn't.

204
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,099
Yes, I did!

205
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:11,899
It's a him, if that's
any kind of consolation to you.

206
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,370
So, look, now that you know

207
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:15,636
I'm not getting laid,
just go to bed, okay?

208
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,973
Nuh-uh, don't. Do not
hang up on me, Stuart.

209
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,034
Don't do that.

210
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,568
Kate, please.

211
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:25,243
I beg of you.
Something big is happening.

212
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:29,119
Something that validates
my entire life...

213
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,919
Something that validates
your entire life.

214
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:32,185
What could that possibly be?

215
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:34,022
Are you sitting down?

216
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,028
Yes.

217
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:36,791
-No, you're not.
-Yes, I am.

218
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,160
No, you're not.

219
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:39,187
Ye...

220
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,760
Okay.

221
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:46,802
I found it.

222
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:48,504
What did you find?

223
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:51,014
The portal.

224
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:53,915
A crack in the fabric of time.

225
00:13:54,318 --> 00:13:55,342
It was over
the East River, Kate

226
00:13:55,386 --> 00:13:56,683
just where I said it would be.

227
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,347
You found the portal?

228
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,449
A portal into April 28th, 1 876.

229
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:07,590
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge
and took a walk in 1 876 today.

230
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:10,862
I followed the Duke of Albany
around old New York.

231
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,266
Are you listening?

232
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:13,635
Avidly.

233
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:16,334
This here's the twist, Kate.
Here's the kicker.

234
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:18,103
What's the kicker?

235
00:14:18,143 --> 00:14:21,010
( whispering ):
He followed me home.

236
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,035
The Duke of Buffalo...

237
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,138
No, the Duke of Albany.

238
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:24,239
...Albany followed you home

239
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:25,249
through a crack in time.

240
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,477
He's a brilliant engineer.

241
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,076
He patented
the counterweight pulley.

242
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,053
He invented the elevator,
for Christ's sake.

243
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:31,749
You know what, Stuart?
You know what?

244
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,280
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

245
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:35,020
I haven't been
for a whole month now.

246
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,493
You can tell me the truth.

247
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,588
I am telling you
the truth, Kate.

248
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:39,859
You can tell me you went

249
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,890
and picked up a transvestite
in Times Square.

250
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,560
I don't care.

251
00:14:43,603 --> 00:14:45,833
You know what, Kate?
This is it, right here.

252
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:48,362
This is it, in a nutshell.
Our downfall.

253
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,739
You never-- not once--
believed in me.

254
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:52,209
Oh, I did, Stuart.

255
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:53,836
I did, for four years.

256
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,312
And I got burnt.

257
00:14:55,348 --> 00:14:57,646
Okay, you want to know
who he is?

258
00:14:57,683 --> 00:14:59,241
I'll tell you who he is.

259
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:00,913
He is a hacker.

260
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,478
High end. English.

261
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:03,955
I know him from Columbia.

262
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:06,653
He's in town for the Mac Expo
at the Javits.

263
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:09,355
We went out, got a little sloppy
on Guinness

264
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:11,261
and he passed out on my couch.

265
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:12,765
And that's the truth?

266
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,232
Mm-hmm. That's the truth.

267
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:15,666
Okay? Are you happy now?

268
00:15:15,702 --> 00:15:17,067
Is that plausible enough

269
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:19,163
for you and your little
focus group?

270
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:21,265
You know what, Stuart?

271
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:24,767
I blew my best years on you.

272
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:27,906
Those were your best?

273
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:35,316
Look...

274
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:37,221
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:38,657
I have to go.

276
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:40,820
You'll get your Pilot
in the morning.

277
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:42,693
( click )

278
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,331
( sighs )

279
00:15:58,947 --> 00:16:00,847
( sniffles )

280
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,324
# #

281
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,845
( Bart whining )

282
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,517
( Bart barks )

283
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,988
( whining )

284
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,491
( growling )

285
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,030
Orange alert.

286
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:58,634
( lively music playing )

287
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,374
( rock music blares )

288
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:05,385
Oh!

289
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:06,613
Otis!

290
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:08,645
Otis!

291
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,291
Bart, stop!

292
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:24,572
It's okay.

293
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,932
( turns music
and television off)

294
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:30,035
-It's okay.
Where am l?

295
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,245
Well, um, there's not
an easy explanation for that.

296
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:35,647
If it's a ransom you seek,
my uncle won't pay a cent.

297
00:17:35,684 --> 00:17:37,015
Except, perhaps, for my demise.

298
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,383
( laughing ):
No. no. You're not
being kidnapped.

299
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:40,388
Bart, quiet!

300
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:42,014
I can scarcely see,
thanks to your spray.

301
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:43,022
My eyes feel like

302
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,353
Steak au Poivre.

303
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:46,760
So I ask you again,
where the hell am l?!

304
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:53,996
( muffled voice shouting )

305
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,903
LEOPOLD:
As far as I'm concerned,
you might be Jack the Ripper!

306
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:01,034
And you would have me believe

307
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:03,169
that I'm being detained
at present in the hereafter?

308
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,179
The time to come?

309
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:05,339
Yes.

310
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:06,939
Bart, quiet!
He needs a walk.

311
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:07,950
Oh, and you would

312
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:08,952
have me believe

313
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:10,078
that you have found
a crack in time.

314
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,215
You, of all people,
should understand.

315
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:13,450
I mean, you're a scientist.

316
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,684
You invented the elevator.

317
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:15,692
What is an elevator?

318
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:16,988
What the hell
are you talk...

319
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,992
Where the hell am l?!

320
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,085
I told you-- you haven't

321
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:20,096
actually gone anywhere.

322
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,154
You're still in New York.

323
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:23,666
That, sir, is not New York!

324
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,361
I'm afraid it is.

325
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:26,994
No, Kate.

326
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:29,070
Hello. Hello there.

327
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:29,783
What's your name?

328
00:18:29,783 --> 00:18:30,681
What's your name?

329
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,242
-Leopold.
-Tell me something.

330
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:33,947
I'm having trouble
with my G-5.

331
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,582
How much RAM do I need
to properly run OS 9.6?

332
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:41,357
Clearly, the Mac Expo is out.

333
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:43,226
So you must be...

334
00:18:43,264 --> 00:18:44,697
a man out of time?

335
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:46,290
Or Sergeant Pepper?

336
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,097
-( Kate laughs )
-STUART:
You know what?

337
00:18:48,136 --> 00:18:49,797
Actually, we could use
a little privacy.

338
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,031
Stuart, I want my Palm Pilot.

339
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:52,039
I'm not...
I'm serious.

340
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:53,040
Maybe later on, Kate.

341
00:18:53,074 --> 00:18:54,507
I just want
my Palm Pilot, Stuart!

342
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:55,510
No. No.

343
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:57,273
Hey, give me my Palm Pilot!

344
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:58,279
Give it to me.

345
00:18:58,313 --> 00:19:00,281
This is madness.
This is madness.

346
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:01,282
Who was that?

347
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:02,840
l-I feel as if I've seen her...

348
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:04,876
Women have changed
since your time, Leo.

349
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,286
They've become dangerous.

350
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:09,552
It's on the landing!

351
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,658
You say this is no kidnapping.

352
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,253
You say you mean no harm.

353
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:18,425
Then why is it, sir,
you will not unlock the door?

354
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:19,833
( Bart barking )

355
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:20,995
I'm sorry, okay?

356
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:23,028
I'm sorry about her. I'm...

357
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:24,733
( barking )

358
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:25,866
Look, with all due respect

359
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:26,876
I can't let you just go

360
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,468
running around free
out there, okay?

361
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:29,478
This is New York City.

362
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,002
It's not such a safe place
anymore.

363
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:32,207
Look at you.

364
00:19:32,248 --> 00:19:34,808
You look like some sort
of psychotic escapee

365
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:36,284
from a Renaissance faire.

366
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,344
I understand you
have some anxiety

367
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:40,219
but you have to trust me.

368
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,691
I'm going to get you home, okay?

369
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:45,359
I promise.

370
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:46,761
Bart!

371
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:49,459
( barking )

372
00:19:50,701 --> 00:19:52,669
The portal opens up again
next week. Monday.

373
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,796
I know that, because it was
my back-up in case

374
00:19:54,838 --> 00:19:55,964
I didn't make it last night.

375
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:57,064
It's on a cycle, you know?

376
00:19:57,107 --> 00:19:58,074
Kind of like, uh...

377
00:19:58,108 --> 00:19:59,473
total eclipse.

378
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,478
Once every 20 years.
You understand?

379
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:03,673
Generally,
I understand everything.

380
00:20:03,714 --> 00:20:05,511
Since I've met you, nothing.

381
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:07,780
I can only assume
I'm in a nightmare

382
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:10,219
brought on by agita,
or else I am dead.

383
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:11,984
You're not dead.

384
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:14,116
Come here. Sit down.

385
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,287
Here.

386
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:18,819
Want some milk in yours?

387
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,660
( Bart barks )

388
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,257
Bart, can I just have...

389
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,597
( barking )

390
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:27,867
Sorry. He's-he's really
got to go out.

391
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:29,602
( whining )

392
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:33,078
Look here.

393
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:34,636
Uh...

394
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,240
I'd be honored
if you took a look at those.

395
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:39,649
Um, I'll explain everything
when I get back.

396
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:40,777
He's got to go out

397
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,549
or he's going to drop
a bomb in there.

398
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:43,680
Come on. Let's go.

399
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:48,555
Back in five.

400
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:49,754
( locks door)

401
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,034
One quick trip to Spectra, Bart

402
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:02,872
and you and I will be Nobel...

403
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,900
Laureates.

404
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:09,943
( elevator bell dings )

405
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,109
( Bart whining )

406
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:13,414
Come on, Bart.

407
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:14,579
Hey, let's go.

408
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,088
-( elevator bell dings )
-Come on.

409
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:16,852
Let's go!

410
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:18,119
( screaming )

411
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,491
( growling )

412
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:22,753
( grunts ):
Oh!

413
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:23,764
Oh.

414
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:25,925
Oh, Jesus!

415
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:31,605
Good boy, Bart!

416
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,630
Stay!

417
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,404
Stay, Bart!

418
00:21:35,443 --> 00:21:36,933
Stay!

419
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,906
Oh, Bart, please stay!

420
00:21:40,949 --> 00:21:42,917
( screaming )

421
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:44,543
( thudding )

422
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,152
( toilet flushing )

423
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:59,426
# #

424
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:18,479
( knocking on door )

425
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:19,488
KATE:
Stuart

426
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:22,685
you forgot the pointy thing!

427
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:25,092
Stuart...

428
00:22:36,874 --> 00:22:38,136
Look, this is not complex.

429
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:39,675
He gave me the Palm Pilot

430
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,507
but he forgot
the pointy thing.

431
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:43,274
I've been warned about you.

432
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:44,804
Oh. Really? And what, pray tell

433
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:46,510
did the great
disappointment say?

434
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,745
That you were dangerous,
though you hardly look it.

435
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:51,449
-Oh, really?
-A lady in trousers isn't
dangerous, merely plain.

436
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,923
I take it you're a career woman.

437
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,448
Yeah, market research.

438
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:56,461
Mm. Fine avocation
for women, research.

439
00:22:56,495 --> 00:22:59,293
Perfect for the feminine mind.

440
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:00,457
Huh.

441
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:02,592
You're a trip, Lionel.

442
00:23:07,372 --> 00:23:11,308
I myself once courted
a librarian in Sussex.

443
00:23:11,343 --> 00:23:13,904
Oh.

444
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:17,109
Good for you.

445
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:18,514
Aha!

446
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:19,984
I must confess

447
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:22,351
I feel as though we've met
i i
on a prevous occason.

448
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:24,117
Well, Lionel, seeing as

449
00:23:24,157 --> 00:23:26,125
I've never met a single
friend of Stuart's--

450
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,888
I'm not even sure
he's ever had any--

451
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:29,952
I really don't see
how that's possible.

452
00:23:31,197 --> 00:23:35,395
Oh, man! Bart!

453
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:37,266
He just made Lake Erie
out there.

454
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:40,398
You just can't toss a dog
out into the hall like that.

455
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:41,567
You can't do that.

456
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:43,132
I assure you, I did not.

457
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,939
( Bart whining )

458
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:45,945
Let's go.

459
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:46,946
I beg your pardon?

460
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,038
Come on.

461
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:48,911
Let's go!

462
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:51,945
Bart...

463
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:53,452
( Bart barking )

464
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:56,320
MAN:
Look, pal, I don't care
how many elevators you got.

465
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:57,721
This one's in my building.

466
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,248
Hang-hang on a second.

467
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:00,851
Sorry about
the elevator, Miss Kate.

468
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:02,453
I've got them
on the phone right now.

469
00:24:02,497 --> 00:24:03,464
Hey, Gracy.

470
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:05,693
This is Lionel,
Stuart's friend.

471
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:07,064
How do you do?

472
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,035
Ten minutes?
I need someone here right now.

473
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,582
( loud funky beat playing )

474
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:28,755
( car alarm blaring )

475
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:41,531
Watch it, man.
-I beg your pardon.

476
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,094
KATE:
Hey, what are you doing?

477
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:44,400
You need to be going
that way.

478
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,702
There's an electron... Hello?

479
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:47,641
Hello? There's
an electronics store. Hello?

480
00:24:47,676 --> 00:24:48,769
I'm sorry, miss.

481
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,609
There's a patch of grass
across the street.

482
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:52,581
Take him there.
He'll do his business.

483
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,379
Can you give this
to Stuart, please?

484
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,907
It's his cable bill.

485
00:25:08,565 --> 00:25:11,363
WOMAN:
They haul our furniture
and cradle our children

486
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:13,927
but this morning, from
the Battery to the Bronx

487
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,439
elevators have mysteriously...

488
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:21,773
( barks )

489
00:25:27,852 --> 00:25:29,683
( tires squealing )

490
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,687
So sorry.

491
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:31,688
Stupid!

492
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:33,155
I do beg your pardon.

493
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:36,318
( tires squealing )

494
00:25:36,361 --> 00:25:38,727
( car horn honking )

495
00:25:38,764 --> 00:25:40,925
I beg your pardon.

496
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:52,833
Are you going to remove that?

497
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,505
I beg your pardon?

498
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:57,140
Pick it up
and put it in the trash.

499
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,184
Absolutely not.

500
00:26:02,922 --> 00:26:04,719
Maybe you don't understand.

501
00:26:04,757 --> 00:26:07,385
It's against the law
to leave it there.

502
00:26:07,427 --> 00:26:09,918
Are you suggesting, madam,
there exists a law

503
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:13,228
compelling gentlemen to lay hold
of canine bowel movements?

504
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:15,257
I'm suggesting you
pick the poop up

505
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:16,632
and throw it away now.

506
00:26:17,937 --> 00:26:20,804
I refuse. Respectfully.

507
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,777
All right.

508
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:26,336
What's your name, fancy pants?

509
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,677
Leopold...

510
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:30,513
Alexis Elija...

511
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:32,109
Walker Thomas Garrett

512
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:34,050
Mountbatten.

513
00:26:38,892 --> 00:26:41,360
All right, Stuart.

514
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:43,727
Have a nice day.

515
00:26:48,003 --> 00:26:50,767
I appreciate you putting in
a good word for me

516
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:52,864
but J.J.'s not back from London.

517
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:53,874
Right. Bye.

518
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:55,876
What's with the elevators?

519
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,343
It's happening everywhere.

520
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:58,539
Darci.

521
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,241
Last page.

522
00:27:07,622 --> 00:27:09,614
( sniffling )

523
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:12,520
I'm sorry.

524
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:14,586
Did everyone live
happily ever after?

525
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,997
He lost his leg to gangrene
waiting for her on the island.

526
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:19,501
But they're together now.

527
00:27:19,535 --> 00:27:20,627
Wonderful.

528
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,570
Oh, look, you got
your Palm Pilot back.

529
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:24,266
A nightmare.

530
00:27:24,306 --> 00:27:27,400
Okay, so who do I owe?

531
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:28,637
Okay, Bobby at Hasbro.

532
00:27:28,678 --> 00:27:29,804
Reeves at Crunch.

533
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:31,972
And the finals came in
for "Love for Sale."

534
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:33,346
The call with the studio's
at 4:00.

535
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:34,407
The margarine thing's in 1 5

536
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:35,577
in the conference room.

537
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:36,813
J.J. wants to talk
to you before that.

538
00:27:36,853 --> 00:27:38,787
Oh, and one more thing.

539
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:40,722
I remember that you told me
to start thinking ahead

540
00:27:40,757 --> 00:27:42,122
so I know your brother's
getting back

541
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,421
from his retreat tomorrow

542
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,655
and if you want something
in the fridge...

543
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:46,663
-Darci...
-Mm-hmm?

544
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:48,722
Can you tell me
why I'm upset right now?

545
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:50,892
Because, uh...

546
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,799
J.J. called this morning.

547
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:54,963
That is why I have a cell phone.

548
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,997
-So you can call me...
-Kate, Kate,
he didn't call.

549
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:59,339
He just popped his head in here
and spoke two sentences.

550
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,674
So he's back?

551
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,373
Margo says he's going to make
a big announcement

552
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:03,471
about the merger next week.

553
00:28:03,514 --> 00:28:05,038
Margo? What does she know?

554
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,072
How does she know

555
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,584
anything about anything?

556
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:11,452
Oh. All right. So he
popped his head in here.

557
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,356
All right, so you have to tell
me exactly what he said, Darci.

558
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,690
You have to start
at the beginning and tell me...

559
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,495
He said, "Tell Kate I'm going
to sit in on Farmer's Bounty."

560
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,467
J.J.

561
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:24,764
Good morning, Kate.

562
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,361
Good morning.

563
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,102
I'll see you in there.

564
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:47,086
( music swells )

565
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:49,825
Good Lord, it still stands.

566
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:53,062
The world has changed
all around it

567
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:56,503
but Roebling's erection
still stands!

568
00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:00,100
That, my friend, is a miracle.

569
00:29:00,142 --> 00:29:01,370
What?

570
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,968
It's a miracle, man!

571
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:04,143
It's a bridge.

572
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,306
Tell me...

573
00:29:05,348 --> 00:29:07,681
when did they adapt it
for steam engines?

574
00:29:07,718 --> 00:29:08,980
( horn blaring )

575
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:11,613
The fire brigade.

576
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,629
I don't know how it happened.

577
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:27,261
I found him in a shaft.

578
00:29:27,304 --> 00:29:28,293
Stuart!

579
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:31,605
Leopold, what are you doing
out here?

580
00:29:31,642 --> 00:29:33,610
Get back inside!

581
00:29:33,644 --> 00:29:34,941
( groaning )

582
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:36,606
One, two, three.

583
00:29:36,647 --> 00:29:38,842
( groaning continues )

584
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:41,317
They're taking him
to Goodman Memorial.

585
00:29:41,352 --> 00:29:44,913
( siren wailing )

586
00:29:44,956 --> 00:29:48,790
Fresh creamery butter.

587
00:29:48,826 --> 00:29:50,953
Is there anything
more comforting?

588
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:52,155
There is

589
00:29:52,196 --> 00:29:53,721
and I know you will agree

590
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:55,165
when you try Farmer's Bounty

591
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:57,639
with the essence of real butter
in every bite.

592
00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:00,039
with the essence of real butter
in every bite.

593
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:01,269
KATE:
Your first choice.

594
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:04,709
However, 45% of our demo
circled "shifty"

595
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:06,441
as his key descriptor.
Not good.

596
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:07,539
This is what I say.

597
00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:09,049
Everybody should be trying

598
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:10,381
Farmer's Bounty

599
00:30:10,418 --> 00:30:13,785
with the real, rich, creamy
taste of real butter.

600
00:30:13,822 --> 00:30:16,052
Try it, and you will be losing
pounds. Poof! Boom! Voila!

601
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:18,117
Your second choice.

602
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,687
Unfortunately, the group found
him obnoxious, abrasive

603
00:30:21,731 --> 00:30:24,791
and a whopping 72%
found him just plain creepy.

604
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:29,168
The spot rolls out in four days.
We have to...

605
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:30,570
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

606
00:30:30,606 --> 00:30:31,800
We have to do
another session.

607
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:33,536
Tomorrow.
I had my assistant book

608
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:36,067
the response room at National
so we can decide

609
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:38,239
then and there.

610
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:41,643
Kate, are you all right?

611
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:42,777
You okay?

612
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:44,081
I'm fine.

613
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,749
Geez, Kate, I'd ask for a decaf.

614
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,451
Monica, I need you
to call Barney's.

615
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:50,653
I need a white blouse,
size small

616
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:52,559
in Kate's office by lunch.

617
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:05,832
-( phone rings )
-Oh, dear.

618
00:31:05,877 --> 00:31:09,973
( answering machine ):
Hi, you've reached Stuart.

619
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:12,278
Please leave a message.

620
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:15,250
STUART:
Leopold? Leopold, look,
don't be frightened.

621
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:16,583
This is Stuart, okay?

622
00:31:16,621 --> 00:31:18,646
Is it Bell's talking telegraph?

623
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,215
I saw a prototype
at last year's faire.

624
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:23,454
I need you to pick up
the handset, Leo.

625
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:27,123
You pick up the green handset,
because I need to talk to you...

626
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:28,724
Are-are you there?

627
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:29,859
-Hello?
-Leopold, thank God.

628
00:31:29,902 --> 00:31:31,426
Listen, they're taking me
to X Rays.

629
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,597
Everything's going to be fine
but you have to stay

630
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:35,300
in the apartment,
do you understand me?

631
00:31:35,341 --> 00:31:38,538
Oh, Stuart,
I saw Roebling's bridge today.

632
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:40,568
I saw it... complete.

633
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:42,170
Yes, yes, but listen to me.

634
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:43,579
You can't go out again.

635
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:45,276
You have to stay
in the apartment.

636
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:47,148
Stay in the apartment?
For how long?

637
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:48,483
Leo, I'll be back tonight.

638
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,078
I promise--
no more field trips.

639
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:51,715
Would you... ( screams )

640
00:31:51,758 --> 00:31:54,022
Hel... hello?

641
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,029
Stuart? Hello?

642
00:31:57,063 --> 00:31:58,758
Blast!

643
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:03,229
Hello.

644
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,396
Hello.

645
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:06,837
Who are you?

646
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:09,706
Hector. My mom works late
on Wednesdays

647
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:11,734
so I watch TV with Stuart.

648
00:32:13,546 --> 00:32:16,380
Want some Pirate's Booty?

649
00:32:17,752 --> 00:32:18,912
J.J.:
Hang on.

650
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:21,683
Excuse me, J.J., I wanted
to thank you for the shirt.

651
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:22,984
That was very nice.

652
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:24,615
Come in, come in.

653
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:26,922
Yeah. Uh-huh.

654
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:28,292
Absolutely.

655
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:29,489
Oh, good, good.

656
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,963
Yeah, she's here right now.

657
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:32,295
I'll tell her.

658
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,800
Okay... okay.

659
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:35,028
Bye.

660
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,094
Sit down.

661
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:38,606
That was Barry.

662
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,902
He was thrilled with your work

663
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:41,067
at the screening last night.

664
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,339
Oh, good. Good.

665
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:52,517
You're a rarity
among women, Kate.

666
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,544
I'm sorry?

667
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:55,988
You don't cling to illusion.

668
00:32:56,024 --> 00:33:00,290
You don't get caught up
in emotion.

669
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:02,422
You don't do pretty.

670
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:05,196
I don't?

671
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,201
You skew male.

672
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:08,100
You're like a man.

673
00:33:08,137 --> 00:33:15,009
A man who understands women--
their desires, their needs.

674
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:16,011
You understand them

675
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:20,141
but you're not really
one of them.

676
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:23,050
You don't mind
my being frank, do you?

677
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,283
No. I don't. No.

678
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,722
Edamame?

679
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,669
Kate?

680
00:33:40,704 --> 00:33:43,832
( man talking in another room )

681
00:33:55,086 --> 00:33:57,452
LEOPOLD:
But one day, he lowered
the Jolly Roger

682
00:33:57,489 --> 00:33:59,286
-Stu?
-and set sail in search

683
00:33:59,324 --> 00:34:01,724
of another kind of treasure.

684
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,523
Not money, not jewels,
not gold...

685
00:34:04,562 --> 00:34:05,620
but a bride.

686
00:34:05,663 --> 00:34:08,131
Despite his being a ruffian
of the brine

687
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,997
fearless in his plunder

688
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,524
and merciless with the sword

689
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:15,131
the Pirate King
was also lonely.

690
00:34:15,174 --> 00:34:17,972
You see,
he had never met a lady.

691
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,705
He never met a girl?

692
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:24,682
No. Not a girl, not a lady,
not even his own mother.

693
00:34:24,717 --> 00:34:26,776
-So what happened?
-As with all comedies

694
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:29,379
the most ridiculous thing
imaginable-- the Pirate King

695
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:31,753
fell in love with
the major general's daughter.

696
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,486
I had the good fortune to see
the premiere last month

697
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:36,052
at the Fifth Avenue Theatre.

698
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:38,394
Since when is
Penzance at the Fifth?

699
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:43,733
Is it your habit, sir

700
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,771
to simply enter a conversation
without introduction?

701
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:46,261
to simply enter a conversation
without introduction?

702
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:48,676
Whoa, you are deep in it.

703
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,303
It's cool. I'm an actor, too.

704
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:52,610
I'm Charlie. I live downstairs.

705
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:55,549
Kate McKay,
senior vice president.

706
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:57,780
Darci, it hasn't happened.

707
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,981
All he did

708
00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:00,114
was dangle a carrot.

709
00:35:00,157 --> 00:35:01,522
Until he makes a decision

710
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,820
the pressure's doubled.

711
00:35:03,293 --> 00:35:04,282
When's he going
to make a decision?

712
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:07,161
We're having dinner tomorrow
to discuss it further

713
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:08,596
at Commune.

714
00:35:08,632 --> 00:35:09,621
-Kate?
-Yeah.

715
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:10,963
-I have Stuart on the line.
-No!

716
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:12,491
-He says he's in the hospital.
-No!

717
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:16,095
Leopold is just sitting alone
in my apartment right now.

718
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,334
God knows what could happen
to him.

719
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:18,601
Do you know he got outside
today?

720
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:20,269
Of course he did--
I made him walk your dog.

721
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,335
What? No, Kate,
you can't do that!

722
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:23,675
He can't go outside!

723
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:25,979
Jesus Christ, Kate.

724
00:35:26,017 --> 00:35:28,485
He's from 1 876, Kate.

725
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,680
He doesn't know our customs.

726
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:31,154
If something were
to happen to him

727
00:35:31,189 --> 00:35:32,349
-it could be catastrophic.
-Shh!

728
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,687
If he doesn't go back

729
00:35:33,725 --> 00:35:35,852
to April 28, 1 876,
he doesn't get married

730
00:35:35,894 --> 00:35:37,885
he doesn't have children,
and you want to know what?

731
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,658
What happened
with the elevators today, well

732
00:35:39,697 --> 00:35:41,255
that's going to seem
like a walk in the park.

733
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:42,357
Stuart! This is embarrassing.

734
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,560
It's embarrassing now,
all right?

735
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,934
Someone has to keep
an eye on him.

736
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:47,700
Stuart, he's a grown man.

737
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,367
He's a grown man. He's fine.

738
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:50,942
He can take care of himself.

739
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:52,341
-No. Wait. Aah!
-I'm going.

740
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:55,145
Kate, please.

741
00:35:55,181 --> 00:35:57,115
Just take this to Spectra, okay?

742
00:35:57,149 --> 00:35:58,138
Get it developed.

743
00:35:58,184 --> 00:35:59,674
You'll see I'm telling
the truth.

744
00:35:59,718 --> 00:36:00,912
Tell Manny it's important.

745
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,386
You want double prints?

746
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:05,297
That's not funny, Kate.

747
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:07,057
This is not a joke.

748
00:36:07,102 --> 00:36:09,833
You need help, Stuart.

749
00:36:09,873 --> 00:36:12,364
You need help.

750
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:18,436
( music coming from upstairs )

751
00:36:27,891 --> 00:36:30,951
#...square of the hypotenuse #

752
00:36:30,994 --> 00:36:33,020
# I'm very good at integral
and differential calculus #

753
00:36:33,063 --> 00:36:35,088
# I know the scientific names
of beings animalculous #

754
00:36:35,132 --> 00:36:36,895
# In short, in matters
vegetable, animal and mineral #

755
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:38,561
# I am the very model
of a modern major-general. #

756
00:36:38,602 --> 00:36:40,194
Charlie?

757
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:43,468
Hey, Kate!

758
00:36:43,507 --> 00:36:46,943
Can I see you downstairs
for a minute?

759
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:48,171
I invited someone to dinner.

760
00:36:48,212 --> 00:36:49,270
He's up there all alone.

761
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:50,439
Stuart's in the hospital.

762
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:52,415
I didn't think you'd
have such a problem...

763
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:53,848
No, you didn't think, Charlie.

764
00:36:53,884 --> 00:36:54,976
You didn't think.

765
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:57,250
You came home early,
one day early from actor camp.

766
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:58,347
Okay, it's not actor camp

767
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,187
and yeah, I came home
a day early, all right?

768
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:01,988
There was this tai chi
broad who kept trying

769
00:37:02,027 --> 00:37:03,688
-stick her fingers...
-No, this is the point.

770
00:37:03,728 --> 00:37:04,922
You immediately march upstairs

771
00:37:04,963 --> 00:37:06,191
to my ex-boyfriend's apartment

772
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:07,755
and you invite
his freakish friend...

773
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:08,766
See, that's what it's about.

774
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,858
It's not that
I went up there.

775
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:11,266
It's that it was
your ex-boyfriend...

776
00:37:11,303 --> 00:37:12,270
No, it's not about Stuart.

777
00:37:12,304 --> 00:37:15,068
Greetings, Kate.

778
00:37:15,106 --> 00:37:16,266
Charles.

779
00:37:16,308 --> 00:37:17,434
Hey, Leo.

780
00:37:17,475 --> 00:37:20,639
Be nice.

781
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,468
So, when's Stuart getting back?

782
00:37:43,537 --> 00:37:45,300
Couple days, maybe a week.

783
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:47,603
He promised me that he would
return late this evening.

784
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,336
Well, maybe he will, Leopold.

785
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:51,207
He's so big on keeping
his promises.

786
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,813
May I have the next course?

787
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:06,417
There is no next course.

788
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:07,984
Ha.

789
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:10,657
Where I come from

790
00:38:10,698 --> 00:38:13,690
the meal is the result
of reflection and study.

791
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:15,828
Menus are prepared in advance

792
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,395
timed to perfection.

793
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:20,339
It is said,
without the culinary arts

794
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,435
the crudeness of reality
would be unbearable.

795
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:25,536
CHARLlE:
We had a saying
in the McKay house:

796
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,411
"You shake and shake
the ketchup bottle.

797
00:38:27,448 --> 00:38:29,609
None will come,
and then a lot'll."

798
00:38:33,022 --> 00:38:34,751
What is that?

799
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,814
I beg your pardon?

800
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:36,882
Why are you standing?

801
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:37,983
I'm accustomed to stand

802
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:39,426
when a lady leaves the table.

803
00:38:48,604 --> 00:38:49,901
Tell me, Charles

804
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:52,168
when Stuart and your
sister were engaged

805
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:53,231
did you happen to read

806
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,005
his papers on
the temporal universe?

807
00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:57,605
I spent the morning perusing
them, and must confess...

808
00:38:57,647 --> 00:38:59,478
Stuart and I were never engaged.

809
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:00,480
Not even close.

810
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,175
But I did read...

811
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:03,185
Thank you.

812
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:04,379
But I did read his papers

813
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:06,013
however, to show support.

814
00:39:06,056 --> 00:39:07,421
CHARLlE:
Is Stuart still trying

815
00:39:07,457 --> 00:39:08,617
to make a time machine?

816
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:10,592
LEOPOLD:
That's the beauty of it--
he discovered

817
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:11,616
no machine was necessary.

818
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:12,958
All one had to do was
to develop

819
00:39:12,996 --> 00:39:14,258
formulae to forecast portals--

820
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:17,289
natural windows
in the fabric of time.

821
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,734
Apparently, Stuart located one

822
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,135
utilizing modern...

823
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:22,662
Ah!

824
00:39:24,275 --> 00:39:27,904
Utilizing modern theories
of weather prediction.

825
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:29,207
What's a portal?

826
00:39:29,246 --> 00:39:31,214
An opening which exists
for but a moment.

827
00:39:31,248 --> 00:39:32,272
This explains why

828
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:33,840
one must jump through it
from a height--

829
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:35,545
in order to achieve
the required velocity.

830
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:36,951
The speed of gravity,
to be exact.

831
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:38,750
It's quite brilliant.

832
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:39,847
You are so method.

833
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,722
You don't even break
for a second, do you?

834
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,727
It's unbelievable!

835
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,251
Oh, stop it, please!

836
00:39:44,296 --> 00:39:45,456
No more! Stop, please?

837
00:39:45,497 --> 00:39:46,759
I beg you. I'm tired.

838
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:48,629
Can you go away?
Can you just go away?

839
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,032
Can you go away?

840
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:52,127
She's drunk, Leo.

841
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,228
Oh, shut up, Charlie!

842
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:54,761
And you, can you go upstairs?

843
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:55,932
Can you go away?

844
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:58,841
I am truly sorry if I have
offended you in any way.

845
00:39:58,877 --> 00:40:00,078
Goodnight, Charles.

846
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:01,340
Goodnight, Charles.

847
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,019
Goodnight, Leo.

848
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:10,751
What the hell was that?

849
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,792
He thinks he's from
the 1 9th century, Charlie.

850
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,160
He thinks he's a duke.

851
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:16,596
I know. lsn't that cool?

852
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:17,825
No.

853
00:40:17,866 --> 00:40:18,992
Kate, he's in character.

854
00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:20,194
He is an actor.

855
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:21,930
Oh, really? For what show?

856
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:23,598
You know that just because

857
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,766
someone doesn't have
i i
a payng gg

858
00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:28,903
it doesn't mean they're not
working on their craft.

859
00:40:33,216 --> 00:40:36,083
( sighs heavily )

860
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:06,921
-( beeping )
-( gasping )

861
00:41:11,962 --> 00:41:13,930
What's going on here?

862
00:41:13,964 --> 00:41:17,059
I think there's something wrong
with his, uh...

863
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:20,469
-( beeping stops )
-thing.

864
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:23,600
Give me that telephone.

865
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:25,109
No.

866
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:26,201
Give it to me.

867
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:27,074
No, I need to...

868
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,911
What do you expect me to do?

869
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,279
You took away my cell phone.

870
00:41:31,316 --> 00:41:33,216
They're not allowed
on hospital property.

871
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:34,582
I have to make a phone call!

872
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,110
You're not going
to make one now.

873
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:38,418
No, no, you don't understand.

874
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:39,981
This is a very important
phone call.

875
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:41,493
I have to leave
this hospital now.

876
00:41:41,527 --> 00:41:42,619
I can't be here anymore.

877
00:41:42,662 --> 00:41:44,289
Mr. Besser

878
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,627
I am tired
of telling you this.

879
00:41:45,665 --> 00:41:47,155
You are not going nowhere

880
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:49,531
until Dr. Feinstein signs
your release!

881
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,503
Did you ever take any
earth science, Esther, hmm?

882
00:41:52,538 --> 00:41:54,233
You look like a smart woman.

883
00:41:54,273 --> 00:41:56,901
Ever hear of the
time-space continuum?

884
00:41:56,942 --> 00:41:58,933
Sounds important, doesn't it?
Well, it is.

885
00:41:58,978 --> 00:42:01,071
And you want to know
something, Esther?

886
00:42:01,113 --> 00:42:02,206
It's broken! Okay?

887
00:42:02,249 --> 00:42:04,615
And I'm the only guy
who can fix it.

888
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:06,050
So why don't you
go down the hall there

889
00:42:06,086 --> 00:42:07,246
and get on your
little telephone

890
00:42:07,287 --> 00:42:08,276
and call Dr. Feinstein...

891
00:42:08,322 --> 00:42:10,153
Goodnight, Mr. Besser.

892
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,782
You tell him that...

893
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:15,287
You tell him that l...

894
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,796
WOMAN:
Point the toes,
pull your shoulders back.

895
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:24,235
Take a deep breath in

896
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:27,435
and then exhale
into downward-facing dog.

897
00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:28,669
( smoke detector beeping )

898
00:42:28,776 --> 00:42:31,176
( barking )

899
00:42:31,212 --> 00:42:32,941
( groans )

900
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,471
LEOPOLD:
Oh, be quiet!

901
00:42:35,516 --> 00:42:37,507
Be quiet... oh!

902
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:44,587
( smoke detector beeping, )
Bart barking )

903
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,130
Bart, shut up!

904
00:42:54,169 --> 00:42:56,296
That thing is a damned hazard!

905
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:58,898
It's just a toaster!

906
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:01,807
Well, insertion of bread
into that so-called toaster

907
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:03,209
produces no toast at all--

908
00:43:03,245 --> 00:43:04,337
merely warm bread!

909
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,075
lnserting the bread twice
produces charcoal.

910
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:07,412
So, clearly,
to make proper toast

911
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:09,144
it requires
one and a half insertions

912
00:43:09,184 --> 00:43:11,118
which is something
for which the apparatus

913
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:12,245
doesn't begin to allow!

914
00:43:12,287 --> 00:43:14,222
One assumes

915
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:16,452
that when the General
of Electric built it

916
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,017
he might have tried using it.

917
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:21,087
One assumes the General might
take pride in his creations

918
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,530
instead of just foisting them

919
00:43:22,565 --> 00:43:23,862
on an unsuspecting public.

920
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,527
You know something?

921
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:28,196
Nobody gives a rat's ass

922
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,002
that you have to push
the toast down twice.

923
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,507
You know why?

924
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:35,272
Because everybody
pushes their toast down twice!

925
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:37,109
Not where I come from.

926
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:39,173
Oh, because where you come from

927
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:43,152
toast is the result
of reflection and study.

928
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,279
Yes, you mock me.

929
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,084
But perhaps one day, when you've

930
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,886
awoken from a pleasant slumber

931
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,425
to the scent of a warm brioche

932
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,485
smothered in marmalade
and fresh creamery butter

933
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:52,894
you'll understand that life

934
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:56,694
is not solely comprised
of tasks, but tastes.

935
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:59,533
Say that again.

936
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,067
Pardon me?

937
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:06,509
-Did they start yet?
-DARCl:
Yes.

938
00:44:06,545 --> 00:44:07,637
Session list.

939
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,477
Leopold, Darci.
Darci, Leopold.

940
00:44:10,515 --> 00:44:12,244
I'd like him to read.

941
00:44:12,284 --> 00:44:14,218
Can you tack him on
at the end?

942
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:15,310
And, Leopold, go with Darci.

943
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,446
She'll take you to the greenroom
and explain everything.

944
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:18,478
I need to work out.

945
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:19,717
I need a place I can work out.

946
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:20,725
If I could get Mr. Duke?

947
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:23,092
Is he ready? Where is he?

948
00:44:23,129 --> 00:44:24,858
Oh, my God, look at this.

949
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:26,125
Let's skip this one.

950
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,757
Mr. Duke, right here
on the floor.

951
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,563
Excuse me,
that's your mark, right there.

952
00:44:29,602 --> 00:44:30,864
Just stand on that tape line.

953
00:44:30,937 --> 00:44:31,995
Look, forget this guy.

954
00:44:32,038 --> 00:44:33,665
I can't waste
any more time, J.J.

955
00:44:33,706 --> 00:44:35,469
We need to make
a decision now.

956
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:37,339
All right, we've got
plenty of good choices.

957
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:38,400
Let's cut it off, Kate.

958
00:44:38,444 --> 00:44:41,311
That would be a mistake, J.J.

959
00:44:41,347 --> 00:44:43,838
Kate, the client wants
to move on.

960
00:44:43,883 --> 00:44:45,714
We should see this last guy.

961
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,686
lt'll... Two minutes!

962
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:50,349
I think he looks like
the Quaker Oats guy.

963
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,517
Well, Phil, it's really not
about what you think.

964
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,753
It's about what they think.

965
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:55,022
They've been in a coma all day

966
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:57,155
and now look at them.

967
00:44:57,197 --> 00:45:00,598
To them, this guy is a dream.

968
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:03,330
He's handsome,
honest, courteous.

969
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,930
Stands when you
walk in a room.

970
00:45:05,973 --> 00:45:09,136
Brings you brioche in bed.

971
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:11,008
If you eat his margarine

972
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:12,808
maybe your hips will shrink

973
00:45:12,847 --> 00:45:14,781
and he'll come to your door.

974
00:45:14,816 --> 00:45:16,977
I take it this is to be
delivered in direct address

975
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:18,315
as on Geronimo.

976
00:45:18,353 --> 00:45:19,786
Geronimo?

977
00:45:19,821 --> 00:45:21,311
He means Geraldo.

978
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:23,347
Exactly.

979
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:25,518
Okay, everyone-- quiet please.

980
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,960
And action.

981
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:35,299
Start talking, bud.

982
00:45:35,337 --> 00:45:40,274
Fresh creamery butter.

983
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:43,574
Is there anything
more comforting?

984
00:45:43,612 --> 00:45:44,874
I say there is.

985
00:45:44,914 --> 00:45:47,644
And perhaps you'll agree
when you sample

986
00:45:47,683 --> 00:45:49,310
fat-free Farmer's Bounty

987
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:52,252
with the genuine essence
of creamery butter

988
00:45:52,288 --> 00:45:53,653
in every bite.

989
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:56,556
With every mouthful
of Farmer's Bounty

990
00:45:56,592 --> 00:45:59,892
you shall receive butter's
luxurious comfort in your mouth

991
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,728
without adding to the luxury
of your waistline.

992
00:46:02,766 --> 00:46:04,825
Not bad, Kate.

993
00:46:04,935 --> 00:46:07,165
Where'd you find him?

994
00:46:07,203 --> 00:46:09,194
He lives in my building.

995
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:11,230
KATE:
Where do I sign?

996
00:46:11,274 --> 00:46:13,742
Right here, and here.

997
00:46:13,777 --> 00:46:15,677
Oh! Hi.

998
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:17,077
That was spectacular, Kate.

999
00:46:17,113 --> 00:46:18,239
Thanks, J.J.

1000
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:21,445
A lot to talk about
tonight at dinner.

1001
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:24,477
Nice work, Mr. Margarine.

1002
00:46:24,522 --> 00:46:26,854
Thank you.

1003
00:46:26,924 --> 00:46:29,757
Outfit was a great idea. Nice.

1004
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:38,496
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

1005
00:46:38,536 --> 00:46:40,128
Whoo!

1006
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:43,163
( laughing )

1007
00:46:43,207 --> 00:46:44,869
You seem pleased.

1008
00:46:44,943 --> 00:46:47,434
Oh, you did so great in there!

1009
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:49,777
Man!

1010
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:55,412
You are going to be on
a national television spot!

1011
00:46:57,422 --> 00:46:59,390
I take it you're dining
with that man tonight.

1012
00:46:59,424 --> 00:47:00,891
Huh? Oh, yeah, J.J.

1013
00:47:00,926 --> 00:47:02,188
He's my boss.

1014
00:47:02,227 --> 00:47:04,787
You require a chaperone.

1015
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,320
His intentions are obvious.

1016
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,697
I'm alone with you.

1017
00:47:07,734 --> 00:47:09,201
Do I need a chaperone?

1018
00:47:09,235 --> 00:47:10,361
We're not courting, Kate.

1019
00:47:10,403 --> 00:47:11,665
If we were, as a man of honor

1020
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:14,172
I would have informed you
of my intentions in writing.

1021
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,538
Oh...

1022
00:47:33,394 --> 00:47:34,827
Good day.

1023
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:38,023
Hey!

1024
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:40,158
Kate, why don't we take
one of these.

1025
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,100
They're for tourists.

1026
00:47:42,136 --> 00:47:44,536
Sorry, she doesn't
seem interested.

1027
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,698
Oh, hey, hello. Hello.

1028
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:50,642
Hey! Hey!

1029
00:47:51,812 --> 00:47:53,643
Hey! Hey, you...

1030
00:47:55,383 --> 00:47:56,407
Kate!

1031
00:47:56,451 --> 00:47:58,612
Hey, you asshole!

1032
00:48:02,323 --> 00:48:03,790
Hey!

1033
00:48:03,825 --> 00:48:05,554
I'm going to get you!

1034
00:48:17,205 --> 00:48:18,696
Hey!

1035
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:21,039
Asshole!

1036
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:24,205
Goddamn it.

1037
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:26,874
( panting )

1038
00:48:37,193 --> 00:48:39,093
Give me your hand.

1039
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:40,254
What?

1040
00:48:40,296 --> 00:48:41,285
Your hand, woman!

1041
00:48:47,237 --> 00:48:49,171
Yah! Yah!

1042
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:52,141
( Kate screaming )

1043
00:48:59,149 --> 00:49:00,480
What do you think you're doing?

1044
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:05,619
Whoa, hey!

1045
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:09,150
( horse whinnies )

1046
00:49:09,193 --> 00:49:10,319
Yah!

1047
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,782
I warn you, scoundrel

1048
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:35,582
I was trained to ride
at the King's Academy

1049
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:37,486
and schooled in weaponry
by the palace guard.

1050
00:49:37,523 --> 00:49:39,388
You stand no chance.

1051
00:49:39,424 --> 00:49:40,516
Where you run, I shall ride

1052
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,254
and when you stop,
the steel of this strap

1053
00:49:42,294 --> 00:49:43,556
will be lodged in your brain.

1054
00:49:46,665 --> 00:49:49,566
( cheering )

1055
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,549
Your boyfriend's
a very good rider.

1056
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,081
Yeah.

1057
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,906
Are you for real?

1058
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,575
Pardon me?

1059
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,449
Are you for real?

1060
00:50:38,485 --> 00:50:41,580
I believe so.

1061
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:44,615
You're a duke.

1062
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:47,924
I was born a duke.

1063
00:50:48,029 --> 00:50:51,521
I've never felt like one.

1064
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,334
LEOPOLD:
Stay. Sit.

1065
00:50:58,373 --> 00:51:01,604
On your feet. Stay.

1066
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:04,613
( Bart whimpers )

1067
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:10,316
Stay. Good boy.

1068
00:51:17,493 --> 00:51:19,427
I'm off to dinner.

1069
00:51:19,462 --> 00:51:20,724
What are you two doing?

1070
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:21,889
I don't know.

1071
00:51:21,964 --> 00:51:24,455
Maybe we'll watch
the rest of the game

1072
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,900
or go out or something.

1073
00:51:25,936 --> 00:51:27,563
Oh, thank you.

1074
00:51:27,604 --> 00:51:31,062
Kate, may I repeat my offer
to serve as a chaperone?

1075
00:51:31,108 --> 00:51:32,507
No, thank you, Leopold.

1076
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:34,908
Charles, don't you
find this inappropriate?

1077
00:51:35,012 --> 00:51:36,343
As her brother,
I would think...

1078
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,677
As her brother, I would think

1079
00:51:37,714 --> 00:51:39,705
that my sister would invite me
to an audition.

1080
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,082
Could be just me, though.

1081
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,586
Seems kind, but...

1082
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,712
-Charlie.
-Hmm?

1083
00:51:44,755 --> 00:51:47,155
You're not exactly
a margarine spokesperson.

1084
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,680
I can't sell butter, Kate?

1085
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:49,886
I don't mean to be insulting...

1086
00:51:49,928 --> 00:51:50,917
It's insulting. I'm an actor.

1087
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:52,587
You don't have faith in me
to sell butter?

1088
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:54,222
No. No. I'm sorry.

1089
00:51:54,265 --> 00:51:55,232
I can do British, Kate.

1090
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:56,563
I'm an actor.
I can be anybody!

1091
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:57,863
You're a very, very good actor.

1092
00:51:57,902 --> 00:51:58,926
-I am a good actor.
-You are.

1093
00:51:59,037 --> 00:52:00,527
Okay, fine, all right.

1094
00:52:00,571 --> 00:52:04,667
A Victorian dude who's never
seen a Mets game watching TV.

1095
00:52:04,709 --> 00:52:05,835
Okay.

1096
00:52:05,877 --> 00:52:07,868
Scene-- I say,
are those little people

1097
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:09,503
in that box of phosphorous?

1098
00:52:09,547 --> 00:52:10,878
Crikey, I believe it is!

1099
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:13,543
This game's more
beguiling than cricket!

1100
00:52:13,585 --> 00:52:15,143
lndian: Good golly, oh, Jesus!

1101
00:52:15,187 --> 00:52:17,485
It looks like Mike Piazza
just hit a game!

1102
00:52:17,523 --> 00:52:18,615
How about Canadian?

1103
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:19,715
Oh, right on.

1104
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:22,249
Right on, you like butter, huh?

1105
00:52:22,294 --> 00:52:24,228
Yeah, what's that about?

1106
00:52:24,263 --> 00:52:26,629
Good night.

1107
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:28,189
Good night.

1108
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:30,497
...all those people
up in that stadium.

1109
00:52:30,536 --> 00:52:32,231
Know what they probably
could go for?

1110
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:33,465
Some margarine!

1111
00:52:33,872 --> 00:52:35,567
When your friend walked in
in that outfit

1112
00:52:35,607 --> 00:52:38,634
I was getting a little
nervous for you there.

1113
00:52:38,678 --> 00:52:42,273
"lf you eat his margarine,
maybe your hips will shrink."

1114
00:52:42,315 --> 00:52:44,283
It's brilliant.

1115
00:52:44,317 --> 00:52:46,478
You saved Phil from
his own ambivalence.

1116
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:48,749
I knew it was the way to go--
in my gut.

1117
00:52:48,788 --> 00:52:50,653
I'm counting on that gut.

1118
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,659
Can I get a bottle
of your '95 Lynch-Bages

1119
00:52:53,693 --> 00:52:55,092
and a bottle of Evian?

1120
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:56,288
I'll tell you one thing

1121
00:52:56,329 --> 00:52:58,923
your friend is going to be
bigger than Mr. Whipple.

1122
00:52:58,965 --> 00:53:01,161
Thanks.

1123
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:02,965
You're not sleeping with him,
are you?

1124
00:53:03,004 --> 00:53:05,268
No.

1125
00:53:06,974 --> 00:53:08,271
No.

1126
00:53:10,077 --> 00:53:12,045
( techno music blaring )

1127
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,138
Leo. Leo, come on. Come here.

1128
00:53:14,181 --> 00:53:15,842
How's it going, man?

1129
00:53:21,622 --> 00:53:24,490
See the girl with
the long brown hair?

1130
00:53:24,526 --> 00:53:25,823
That's Patrice.

1131
00:53:25,861 --> 00:53:27,158
She's lovely.

1132
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:28,457
She's mine.

1133
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,590
Congratulations.

1134
00:53:40,442 --> 00:53:42,433
Hey, everybody, this is Leo!

1135
00:53:42,477 --> 00:53:44,001
Leo, this is everybody.

1136
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,911
What's up? Dennis.

1137
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,074
Shelby, Allison, Monica.

1138
00:53:48,117 --> 00:53:50,085
And this, this is

1139
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:52,553
the insatiable Patrice.

1140
00:53:52,588 --> 00:53:53,919
Hey, Charlie.

1141
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:55,048
Hey.

1142
00:53:55,091 --> 00:53:56,319
How do you do?

1143
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:57,917
Patrice, let me assist you.

1144
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,052
Thanks.

1145
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:00,562
You got it?

1146
00:54:00,596 --> 00:54:02,689
I was going to get it.

1147
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:09,398
Let me get that for you.

1148
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,435
There you go.

1149
00:54:14,478 --> 00:54:16,309
You look nice tonight.

1150
00:54:16,346 --> 00:54:17,540
Very...

1151
00:54:17,581 --> 00:54:19,913
Like a Judy Blume book.

1152
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:24,513
That's good, because
I thought for a moment

1153
00:54:24,555 --> 00:54:26,716
that body of water here
was a moat.

1154
00:54:26,757 --> 00:54:28,247
No, that's a pond.

1155
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:30,089
The gardens are devastating.

1156
00:54:30,127 --> 00:54:31,219
They are.

1157
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:33,456
They're very,
very beautiful. Ooh.

1158
00:54:33,497 --> 00:54:35,557
You'll have to come
and see them firsthand.

1159
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,658
Right, right.

1160
00:54:36,701 --> 00:54:38,066
After the merger

1161
00:54:38,103 --> 00:54:40,867
I'm going to be stuck
over there, setting things up.

1162
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:42,770
I'll be craving
a little face time

1163
00:54:42,807 --> 00:54:45,241
from my new top
honcho in New York.

1164
00:54:45,276 --> 00:54:48,370
What are you saying?

1165
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:49,778
I'm saying you should
come visit.

1166
00:54:49,814 --> 00:54:51,281
I'll fly you over
for the weekend.

1167
00:54:51,316 --> 00:54:52,874
Oh, yeah, I heard that.

1168
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:55,886
The other part--
the part before that.

1169
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,354
The part about the top honcho.

1170
00:54:57,389 --> 00:54:59,619
I didn't understand that,
that part.

1171
00:54:59,658 --> 00:55:02,024
How about catching an opera
Saturday?

1172
00:55:02,061 --> 00:55:05,053
La Bohéme's at the Met.

1173
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,882
Okay, so she comes back--
the audience is about to leave--

1174
00:55:05,923 --> 00:55:07,390
she comes back on stage

1175
00:55:07,424 --> 00:55:08,891
and she starts
squirting the audience

1176
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:10,985
with this turkey baster
filled with this pine mist.

1177
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:14,724
And she's screaming
"Un-sex me! Un-sex me!"

1178
00:55:14,765 --> 00:55:16,926
But no tears.

1179
00:55:16,967 --> 00:55:19,435
Just raw human passion.

1180
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:21,132
lsn't Willem Dafoe
part of that group?

1181
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:23,106
Yeah, and he did this monologue
about how

1182
00:55:23,141 --> 00:55:26,008
all the best things in life are
hidden in people's basements.

1183
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:27,476
Like the Louvre.

1184
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:32,839
I'm sorry.

1185
00:55:32,884 --> 00:55:34,112
You were saying, Charles?

1186
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:35,551
Just...

1187
00:55:35,587 --> 00:55:36,986
No, what about the Louvre?

1188
00:55:37,022 --> 00:55:38,819
Tell us what you
were going to say.

1189
00:55:38,857 --> 00:55:41,587
Well, only a fraction of
the Louvre is on the walls.

1190
00:55:41,626 --> 00:55:43,025
The rest is in
the basement.

1191
00:55:43,094 --> 00:55:45,620
You've been in the basement
of the Louvre?

1192
00:55:45,665 --> 00:55:46,927
Oh, yes.

1193
00:55:46,966 --> 00:55:48,797
I was an art history major
at Vassar.

1194
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:49,892
Ah.

1195
00:55:49,935 --> 00:55:52,028
And so, what's down there?

1196
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:55,336
Well, that's where
the real show begins.

1197
00:55:55,374 --> 00:55:57,467
Unspoiled by dilettante.

1198
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:02,971
DaVinci, Michelangelo,
David, Chardin.

1199
00:56:03,049 --> 00:56:05,210
"Allow me to assist you,
Patrice.

1200
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:07,481
"Oh, let me light that
for you, Monica.

1201
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,749
"What, this?

1202
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:10,780
( chuckles ):
"This is my family crest.

1203
00:56:10,824 --> 00:56:12,985
"Been in the family for...
Oh, in the basement?

1204
00:56:13,093 --> 00:56:14,685
"What do they have
in the basement?

1205
00:56:14,728 --> 00:56:15,990
"Why, the works of da Vinci

1206
00:56:16,063 --> 00:56:18,554
"Michelangelo, Chardin, David

1207
00:56:18,598 --> 00:56:24,468
all surrounded by great coral
sponges to absorb the moisture."

1208
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:26,529
Just for the record,
I was working it.

1209
00:56:26,573 --> 00:56:28,006
I was in the zone

1210
00:56:28,108 --> 00:56:30,508
and I would have
gotten her number

1211
00:56:30,544 --> 00:56:32,672
if you hadn't turned
the evening

1212
00:56:32,714 --> 00:56:34,978
into a guided tour
of the Louvre.

1213
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,950
My apologies.

1214
00:56:36,984 --> 00:56:38,679
Let's get
one thing straight.

1215
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,620
Patrice, she thought
you were cute--

1216
00:56:40,655 --> 00:56:42,020
probably gay and cute.

1217
00:56:42,123 --> 00:56:44,284
And cute, Leo,
that's the kiss of death.

1218
00:56:44,325 --> 00:56:45,883
-Perhaps.
-Perhaps? Certainly.

1219
00:56:45,927 --> 00:56:48,293
I believe this is her number.

1220
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:51,355
As I see it, Patrice has not
an inkling of your affections.

1221
00:56:51,399 --> 00:56:52,525
And it's no wonder.

1222
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:54,660
You, Charles,
are a merry-andrew.

1223
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,965
A what?

1224
00:56:56,004 --> 00:56:57,699
Everything plays a farce to you.

1225
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,674
Women respond to sincerity.

1226
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,677
This requires pulling one's
tongue from one's cheek.

1227
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:06,238
No one wants to be
romanced by a buffoon.

1228
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:08,249
Now, that number rings her.

1229
00:57:08,283 --> 00:57:10,808
-Yes.
-So ring her tomorrow.

1230
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:12,912
I can't. She gave
the number to you.

1231
00:57:12,955 --> 00:57:16,914
Only because I told her
of your affections.

1232
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:18,621
WhaWhat did you say?

1233
00:57:18,661 --> 00:57:19,992
Merely that you admired her

1234
00:57:20,096 --> 00:57:22,257
but you were hesitant
to make an overture

1235
00:57:22,298 --> 00:57:25,267
since you'd been told
she was courting another.

1236
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:27,861
Shit. That's good!

1237
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,462
WhaWhat did she say?

1238
00:57:29,506 --> 00:57:31,633
She handed me the napkin.

1239
00:57:34,444 --> 00:57:37,004
Charles, it's quite late.

1240
00:57:37,113 --> 00:57:38,978
No, no, no,
she won't be home yet.

1241
00:57:39,015 --> 00:57:41,006
I get her machine,
I leave a message

1242
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:42,916
ball's in her court.

1243
00:57:42,953 --> 00:57:44,887
You're ladling calculation
upon comedy.

1244
00:57:44,922 --> 00:57:47,254
The point is,
to keep the ball in your court.

1245
00:57:49,059 --> 00:57:51,721
You're right. You're right.

1246
00:57:51,762 --> 00:57:52,888
Okay.

1247
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,955
Nothing need be done
till tomorrow.

1248
00:57:54,999 --> 00:57:57,399
Tomorrow.
Then I make my move.

1249
00:57:57,435 --> 00:57:59,232
An overture, Charles.

1250
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:01,135
Make your intentions known.

1251
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:03,970
Think of pleasing her,
not vexing her.

1252
00:58:04,008 --> 00:58:05,533
No vexing.

1253
00:58:05,577 --> 00:58:07,545
You're intoxicated.
We should retire.

1254
00:58:07,579 --> 00:58:09,137
I'm sure Kate will be home.

1255
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:10,375
I doubt it.

1256
00:58:10,415 --> 00:58:12,406
But it's nearly midnight.

1257
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,378
You like her, don't you?

1258
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:18,389
Who?
-Kate.

1259
00:58:18,423 --> 00:58:21,551
-( laughing ):
You do!
-Oh, Charles, stop.

1260
00:58:21,593 --> 00:58:23,584
You like my sister!

1261
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:25,562
Well, you made your
intentions known, right?

1262
00:58:25,597 --> 00:58:26,996
-Right?
-You've been drinking.

1263
00:58:27,065 --> 00:58:27,997
Leo, Commune...

1264
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:29,465
right around the corner.

1265
00:58:29,502 --> 00:58:32,335
We could stop in, you could
give me a couple of pointers

1266
00:58:32,371 --> 00:58:33,668
pull out a chair or two--

1267
00:58:33,706 --> 00:58:35,606
you could throw out a
gesture here or there.

1268
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:37,199
Yeah, see, it's one
thing with Patrice.

1269
00:58:37,243 --> 00:58:38,301
You don't give a shit.

1270
00:58:38,344 --> 00:58:40,209
It's a whole other ball of wax

1271
00:58:40,246 --> 00:58:42,578
when it's a girl you like, huh?

1272
00:58:42,615 --> 00:58:45,675
Yeah, who's
the merry-andrew now?

1273
00:58:45,718 --> 00:58:46,980
( laughs )

1274
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:49,385
You want to vex

1275
00:58:49,422 --> 00:58:51,720
my sister!

1276
00:58:51,757 --> 00:58:54,522
KATE:
I have to confess that
I'm a little bit confused.

1277
00:58:54,561 --> 00:58:56,256
Um...

1278
00:58:56,296 --> 00:58:57,490
No. Thank you.

1279
00:58:57,531 --> 00:58:59,362
When you asked me
to dinner tonight

1280
00:58:59,399 --> 00:59:00,730
I was under the impression

1281
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:02,325
that we were here to discuss...

1282
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:03,700
The merger.

1283
00:59:03,737 --> 00:59:05,728
Yes. Right. Yes.

1284
00:59:05,772 --> 00:59:07,501
And a possible promotion.

1285
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:09,270
Yes.

1286
00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:11,106
Yes, that, too.

1287
00:59:11,144 --> 00:59:14,443
And, well, dinner
is winding down

1288
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:16,109
and we haven't
really discussed

1289
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,811
anything even
remotely relevant

1290
00:59:17,852 --> 00:59:19,786
to what I thought
we came here to...

1291
00:59:19,821 --> 00:59:22,619
I don't believe I've ever
seen you this flustered, Kate.

1292
00:59:22,657 --> 00:59:24,352
You haven't even kissed me yet.

1293
00:59:26,694 --> 00:59:27,888
Yeah.

1294
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:29,829
Right. Well...

1295
00:59:29,864 --> 00:59:31,263
I like you, J.J., I do.

1296
00:59:31,299 --> 00:59:32,698
I like you quite a bit.

1297
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:34,702
Um, as a matter of fact

1298
00:59:34,736 --> 00:59:37,102
I think you would agree
that a working...

1299
00:59:37,138 --> 00:59:38,901
a successful
working relationship

1300
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:40,909
requires a great deal of...

1301
00:59:40,943 --> 00:59:43,002
What exactly is our
working relationship?

1302
00:59:43,045 --> 00:59:44,137
Kate...

1303
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:45,373
Hi, Kate!

1304
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,310
Hi, Charlie.

1305
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:50,181
Well...
what are you doing here?

1306
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,709
We just thought we'd come by

1307
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,812
-to say hi.
-Kate.

1308
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:53,947
-J.J., right?
-Right.

1309
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:55,251
Might I have a word with you?

1310
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,486
-( quietly ):
Now?
-ln private.

1311
00:59:57,526 --> 00:59:59,153
No! No.

1312
00:59:59,194 --> 01:00:01,594
J.J.:
Mr. Margarine.

1313
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:02,756
( chuckles softly )

1314
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,131
Please... please join us.

1315
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:07,033
And where did you say it is?

1316
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,765
-ln Sussex.
-Near Ballmour.

1317
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:11,137
-Yes.
-Built in the 18th century.

1318
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:12,334
Early 1 8th century.

1319
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,673
LEOPOLD:
Really? Are you quite sure?

1320
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,309
Yes.

1321
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,712
He's got pictures, Leopold.

1322
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,978
Perhaps you were swindled,
because I can assure you

1323
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:22,678
as of the late 1 9th century

1324
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,051
there's nothing
but farmland near Ballmour.

1325
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:26,886
-You're mistaken.
-That's not possible.

1326
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:29,586
Well, it's quite possible,
Leopold, that you are mistaken.

1327
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,821
No, it is not.

1328
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:33,455
( both arguing )

1329
01:00:33,497 --> 01:00:34,964
...the only manor house
in the county.

1330
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:35,988
I know because I grew up there.

1331
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:37,159
Leopold, it wasn't...

1332
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:38,429
( J.J. clears throat )

1333
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:39,766
Leo, do you enjoy opera?

1334
01:00:39,804 --> 01:00:41,772
-I do. And do you?
-Oh, yes.

1335
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:43,603
It keeps... keeps me alive.

1336
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:45,666
Do you have a favorite?

1337
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,439
Bohéme. La Bohéme.

1338
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:49,309
- La Bohéme.
-I've seen it 1 2 times.

1339
01:00:49,347 --> 01:00:52,181
That's... that's how
I learned to speak French.

1340
01:00:52,217 --> 01:00:53,684
You speak French?

1341
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:54,743
Fluently.

1342
01:00:54,786 --> 01:00:56,014
Oh.

1343
01:00:56,054 --> 01:00:58,921
LEOPOLD:
Ah. Que ton visage est doux

1344
01:00:58,957 --> 01:01:03,291
entouré par la lumière
de la lune.

1345
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:06,195
What did he say?

1346
01:01:10,669 --> 01:01:12,227
"How sweet your face looks

1347
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:14,637
gently encircled
by the soft moonlight."

1348
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:17,609
Oh, I like that.

1349
01:01:17,644 --> 01:01:19,407
From the opening scene
of Bohéme.

1350
01:01:19,445 --> 01:01:21,640
A stunning duet.

1351
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:23,410
Andre sings it to Mimi.

1352
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:24,746
( chuckling softly ):
Andre...

1353
01:01:24,784 --> 01:01:26,342
I invited Kate
to the Met next week.

1354
01:01:26,386 --> 01:01:27,648
She's never been.

1355
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:30,178
Patrone is singing Andre,
and she turned me down.

1356
01:01:30,223 --> 01:01:31,952
Can you explain that, Leopold?

1357
01:01:33,893 --> 01:01:38,058
Well... La Bohéme is one
of man's great achievements

1358
01:01:38,165 --> 01:01:40,065
and should not be missed.

1359
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,568
But perhaps Kate resists
on moral grounds.

1360
01:01:42,603 --> 01:01:43,695
( groans softly )

1361
01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:44,795
J.J.:
How so?

1362
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:46,305
Should we get the check?

1363
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:49,537
Well, some feel that
to court a woman in one's employ

1364
01:01:49,576 --> 01:01:51,976
is nothing more than
a serpentine effort

1365
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:54,173
to transform a lady to a whore.

1366
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,340
Oh.

1367
01:01:58,385 --> 01:02:00,046
LEOPOLD:
J.J.

1368
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:06,623
This guy's charming, Kate.

1369
01:02:06,661 --> 01:02:09,630
The Duke of Margarine
thinks me a serpent.

1370
01:02:09,664 --> 01:02:12,758
-No, he doesn't.
-LEOPOLD:
No, not a serpent.

1371
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:14,029
That's too grand a word.

1372
01:02:14,135 --> 01:02:15,625
Simply a braggart and a cad

1373
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:18,366
who knows less French than l,
if that's possible.

1374
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:22,376
And by the way

1375
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,403
there's no Andre in
Bohéme-- it's Rudolfo.

1376
01:02:25,448 --> 01:02:27,040
And though it takes place
in France

1377
01:02:27,116 --> 01:02:30,449
it's rarely played in French,
as it is written in ltalian.

1378
01:02:30,486 --> 01:02:32,113
Good night.

1379
01:02:37,526 --> 01:02:40,620
( sighs )

1380
01:02:40,663 --> 01:02:42,858
Sorry.

1381
01:02:52,442 --> 01:02:54,842
Kate, might I have a word?

1382
01:03:25,409 --> 01:03:27,775
# #

1383
01:03:51,637 --> 01:03:54,071
-Morning.
-Hi.

1384
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:57,199
-You want some coffee?
-No, thanks.

1385
01:03:57,242 --> 01:03:59,336
You want to read...
you want to read your paper?

1386
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:00,641
No, thank you, Charlie.

1387
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,704
I want to go to work

1388
01:04:01,748 --> 01:04:04,512
and try and clean up
this mess you made.

1389
01:04:04,551 --> 01:04:07,019
You sure you don't...

1390
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:08,486
Uh...

1391
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,221
Kate...

1392
01:04:16,262 --> 01:04:17,593
Uh, Kate!

1393
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:19,154
What?
-l-I just thought

1394
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,863
maybe you'd want a-a kiwi
for-for-for the subway.

1395
01:04:22,903 --> 01:04:24,200
That's a papaya, Charlie.

1396
01:04:24,238 --> 01:04:25,330
Oh.

1397
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:27,840
You're right. Okay.

1398
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:32,178
BOB:
But while using the product

1399
01:04:32,213 --> 01:04:36,445
80% found the product
too soft to be...

1400
01:04:36,483 --> 01:04:37,882
effective.

1401
01:04:37,918 --> 01:04:39,510
This, of course, presents

1402
01:04:39,553 --> 01:04:41,885
a conundrum for us marketeers.

1403
01:04:41,922 --> 01:04:46,553
How do we maintain a soft feel
on the exterior

1404
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:50,895
of a plastic wrap or pack
while retaining

1405
01:04:50,932 --> 01:04:53,423
the useful tensile strength
in the sheets?

1406
01:04:53,468 --> 01:04:56,528
Now, I'm going to suggest
to the Summer Soft people

1407
01:04:56,571 --> 01:04:59,267
to scale back to a limited
release of the product

1408
01:04:59,307 --> 01:05:02,538
in the mid-Atlantic states,
where we can refine the product

1409
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:04,909
( fading out )
on the basis of extensive...

1410
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:10,618
LEOPOLD:
Dearest Katherine...

1411
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:13,019
I behaved as an imbecile
last night

1412
01:05:13,122 --> 01:05:17,991
animated in part by drink,
in part by your beauty

1413
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:20,552
and in part
by my own foolish pride.

1414
01:05:20,596 --> 01:05:23,030
And for that
I am profoundly sorry.

1415
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:25,727
Please accept
as a gesture of apology

1416
01:05:25,768 --> 01:05:31,263
a private dinner on the rooftop
tonight at 8:00.

1417
01:05:31,307 --> 01:05:34,209
J.J. :
Okay, where are we
on Farmer's Bounty?

1418
01:05:34,244 --> 01:05:36,235
Kate?

1419
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,578
Care to share with us?

1420
01:05:39,616 --> 01:05:41,641
Farmer's Bounty?

1421
01:05:41,685 --> 01:05:44,051
Where we are.

1422
01:05:44,154 --> 01:05:46,247
Where we are is good.

1423
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:49,589
Um, as you know, we
found our spokesperson.

1424
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:53,357
The response room final showed
a 96 in the top two boxes.

1425
01:05:53,397 --> 01:05:56,526
His key female descriptors...

1426
01:05:56,567 --> 01:05:58,467
were "handsome," "romantic"

1427
01:05:58,503 --> 01:06:00,705
with several write-ins
of... "What a hunk."

1428
01:06:00,705 --> 01:06:01,103
with several write-ins
of... "What a hunk."

1429
01:06:05,012 --> 01:06:06,274
Great.

1430
01:06:07,348 --> 01:06:09,714
( groans softly )

1431
01:06:10,818 --> 01:06:12,080
Would you hold this?

1432
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:13,143
J.J.?

1433
01:06:13,254 --> 01:06:14,380
J.J., hi.

1434
01:06:14,421 --> 01:06:16,616
Um, listen, I just want
to apologize again

1435
01:06:16,657 --> 01:06:18,022
for what happened last night.

1436
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:21,722
There was no need
for things to get that way.

1437
01:06:21,763 --> 01:06:23,458
I appreciate that.

1438
01:06:23,498 --> 01:06:26,695
So... everything's okay?

1439
01:06:26,735 --> 01:06:28,532
Yes, Kate.

1440
01:06:30,872 --> 01:06:33,067
STUART:
I didn't jump; I fell.

1441
01:06:33,108 --> 01:06:34,370
There's a difference--

1442
01:06:34,409 --> 01:06:36,536
a subtle difference,
but nonetheless a difference.

1443
01:06:36,578 --> 01:06:38,273
DOCTOR:
So how did you fall down there?

1444
01:06:38,313 --> 01:06:39,507
Because there was no elevator.

1445
01:06:39,548 --> 01:06:41,038
And you feel that
was your fault?

1446
01:06:41,082 --> 01:06:42,414
You know what, I'm sorry.

1447
01:06:42,451 --> 01:06:45,545
I got to concede that
you are a very busy man

1448
01:06:45,588 --> 01:06:48,079
and I'm sure there are
plenty of people clamoring

1449
01:06:48,124 --> 01:06:50,115
for your particular
brand of attention.

1450
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:51,922
Unfortunately,
I am not one of them.

1451
01:06:51,961 --> 01:06:54,225
So if you don't mind, would you
please unlock this door?

1452
01:06:55,097 --> 01:06:57,395
I'm concerned you might be
a danger to yourself.

1453
01:06:57,433 --> 01:06:59,458
And in such cases

1454
01:06:59,502 --> 01:07:02,767
-Hello?!
-state law requires
that I keep you under...

1455
01:07:02,805 --> 01:07:05,273
Will someone please
open... Aah! Aah!

1456
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:09,242
( groaning in pain )

1457
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:12,271
Everything all right,
Dr. Geisler?

1458
01:07:12,316 --> 01:07:14,307
Yes, Gretchen.
Everything's fine.

1459
01:07:15,592 --> 01:07:16,524
( Stuart groaning )

1460
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:17,260
Stuart, I'm going to prescribe

1461
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:17,885
Stuart, I'm going to prescribe

1462
01:07:17,927 --> 01:07:21,192
something called Prolixin.

1463
01:07:21,231 --> 01:07:23,199
It's a mild antipsychotic.

1464
01:07:23,233 --> 01:07:25,428
Nothing too strong.

1465
01:07:25,468 --> 01:07:28,232
( quietly ):
"l was wondering...

1466
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:31,435
"l was wondering if you
would like to accompany me...

1467
01:07:31,475 --> 01:07:33,033
( mumbling )

1468
01:07:33,077 --> 01:07:35,011
"lf you've already been
previously engaged

1469
01:07:35,046 --> 01:07:37,014
I understand."

1470
01:07:38,883 --> 01:07:40,748
Tonight at 7:00, 7:30.

1471
01:07:40,785 --> 01:07:42,650
Please don't be late.

1472
01:07:44,422 --> 01:07:46,049
I got to talk to you
about this, okay?

1473
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,650
'Cause there's some shit here
that just cannot be said.

1474
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:50,684
Did you assemble
a bouquet for Patrice?

1475
01:07:50,728 --> 01:07:52,890
Look, you just can't
tell a woman she's...

1476
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:54,057
"gracefully serene."

1477
01:07:54,099 --> 01:07:55,430
No, no, this will not do.

1478
01:07:55,467 --> 01:07:57,560
Wha... Why?

1479
01:07:57,602 --> 01:07:59,160
What is wrong with this one?

1480
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:01,195
The orange lily
implies extreme hatred.

1481
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:02,672
The begonia and lavender

1482
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:04,767
danger and suspicion,
respectively.

1483
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,438
Every flower has
a meaning, Charles.

1484
01:08:07,479 --> 01:08:11,745
Might I suggest the amaryllis,
which declares the recipient

1485
01:08:11,783 --> 01:08:13,842
a most splendid beauty.

1486
01:08:13,885 --> 01:08:17,151
Or the cabbage rose.

1487
01:08:21,294 --> 01:08:22,852
Darci!

1488
01:08:25,264 --> 01:08:26,322
Hmm?

1489
01:08:26,366 --> 01:08:28,493
What is this?
-It's a reply

1490
01:08:28,534 --> 01:08:30,798
-to Leopold's invitation.
-Uh-huh?

1491
01:08:30,837 --> 01:08:32,395
You're going, right?

1492
01:08:32,438 --> 01:08:33,598
I haven't decided yet.

1493
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:34,970
Oh, you haven't decided

1494
01:08:35,007 --> 01:08:37,976
if you want to have dinner
on your rooftop with a duke?

1495
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:41,071
Who thinks he's from 1876!

1496
01:08:41,115 --> 01:08:42,673
No! And I would
appreciate it if...

1497
01:08:42,716 --> 01:08:44,013
Kate, come on, okay?

1498
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:46,178
I don't know what this guy did
to piss you off

1499
01:08:46,253 --> 01:08:47,880
but that is
the best apology letter

1500
01:08:47,921 --> 01:08:49,183
in the history of mankind.

1501
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:51,086
-( phone ringing )
-Just sign it, Kate.

1502
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,116
It's 4:30. We'll fax it.

1503
01:08:54,294 --> 01:08:55,522
Kate McKay's office.

1504
01:08:56,997 --> 01:08:59,022
They hung up.

1505
01:09:00,834 --> 01:09:03,326
CHARLlE:
Hi. Is Patrice there?

1506
01:09:03,905 --> 01:09:06,271
Hey, Patrice?

1507
01:09:06,307 --> 01:09:10,300
Hi. It's me, Charlie.

1508
01:09:10,411 --> 01:09:12,311
Hey, Charlie.

1509
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,109
I was just calling to find out

1510
01:09:14,148 --> 01:09:16,207
if you got my flowers--
your flowers.

1511
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,413
I was calling to see if you got
the flowers I sent you.

1512
01:09:19,453 --> 01:09:20,852
Yeah, I did.

1513
01:09:20,888 --> 01:09:22,480
And I was just wondering

1514
01:09:22,523 --> 01:09:24,548
if you would like to go
to a movie tonight

1515
01:09:24,592 --> 01:09:26,082
and maybe afterwards perhaps

1516
01:09:26,127 --> 01:09:28,619
accompany me to dinner?

1517
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,995
I mean, l...

1518
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:33,763
I understand completely
if you're otherwise engaged.

1519
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:37,465
But, uh, you know,
I just wanted to say that, um...

1520
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:38,768
Yeah?

1521
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,702
I wanted to say
that you've, uh...

1522
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:50,442
you've made an impression on me.

1523
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:55,518
And-and it-it's not
just the way you look--

1524
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:56,820
I mean, which are great.

1525
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,919
Your looks are,
you know, top-top shelf.

1526
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:00,759
But, uh...

1527
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:07,199
I don't know, it's, um...

1528
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:09,296
What?

1529
01:10:09,339 --> 01:10:14,039
You're graceful.

1530
01:10:14,078 --> 01:10:18,947
You know, the way you move
and speak.

1531
01:10:18,983 --> 01:10:21,747
I mean, some people have a way
with words

1532
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:23,810
and, you know, you... you do.

1533
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:29,589
The bottom line is, I like you.

1534
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:37,025
Patrice?

1535
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:39,628
What about 7:00?

1536
01:10:39,671 --> 01:10:42,265
7:00?

1537
01:10:42,307 --> 01:10:45,140
7:00 would be heaven. Okay.

1538
01:10:45,176 --> 01:10:46,803
See you then.

1539
01:10:46,845 --> 01:10:48,403
It worked!

1540
01:10:48,446 --> 01:10:49,413
It worked cool!

1541
01:10:49,447 --> 01:10:50,505
# Who's going out
with Patrice? #

1542
01:10:50,548 --> 01:10:52,516
# Charlie's going out
with Patrice! #

1543
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:53,574
# Charlie's going over there. #

1544
01:10:53,618 --> 01:10:55,745
Oh, better go get ready.

1545
01:10:55,787 --> 01:10:56,811
Better go get changed.

1546
01:10:56,855 --> 01:10:58,686
Shouldn't change
too much, though

1547
01:10:58,723 --> 01:11:00,452
'cause she likes me
for who I am.

1548
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:08,298
Oh.

1549
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:09,299
Hey.

1550
01:11:09,368 --> 01:11:11,632
Charlie, you look fantastic.

1551
01:11:11,671 --> 01:11:12,933
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1552
01:11:12,972 --> 01:11:14,803
I got a date.

1553
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,001
I got to go. Bye.

1554
01:11:17,043 --> 01:11:18,067
Bye.

1555
01:11:21,614 --> 01:11:22,638
Kate?

1556
01:11:22,682 --> 01:11:23,649
Yeah?

1557
01:11:23,683 --> 01:11:26,949
Um, have a good time tonight.

1558
01:11:28,522 --> 01:11:29,682
Bye.

1559
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:58,613
( siren blaring in distance )

1560
01:12:00,788 --> 01:12:04,656
( violin playing
romantic music )

1561
01:12:15,637 --> 01:12:17,571
My God.

1562
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:22,677
This is beautiful.

1563
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:26,977
The very word for which
I was searching.

1564
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:30,282
May l?

1565
01:12:48,671 --> 01:12:50,969
KATE:
She was a real romantic, my mom.

1566
01:12:51,007 --> 01:12:55,239
When Prince Charles and Lady Di
got married, she had a party.

1567
01:12:55,278 --> 01:12:57,143
She made crumpets and jam.

1568
01:12:57,180 --> 01:13:00,344
It was like a Super Bowl party,
but for moms.

1569
01:13:00,384 --> 01:13:01,783
She cried for a week.

1570
01:13:01,819 --> 01:13:03,309
I don't know the story

1571
01:13:03,354 --> 01:13:05,345
of Prince Charles and Lady Di.

1572
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:06,879
Oh, you don't want to.

1573
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:09,051
It's a cautionary tale.
Further proof.

1574
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,287
Of what?

1575
01:13:10,327 --> 01:13:12,386
You can't live a fairy tale.

1576
01:13:31,149 --> 01:13:34,812
I'm not very good with men.

1577
01:13:34,853 --> 01:13:38,755
Perhaps you haven't found
the right one.

1578
01:13:43,829 --> 01:13:44,818
Maybe.

1579
01:13:44,863 --> 01:13:47,264
Or, uh, maybe
the whole love thing

1580
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:50,292
is just a grown-up version
of Santa Claus

1581
01:13:50,336 --> 01:13:53,328
just a myth we've been fed
since childhood

1582
01:13:53,372 --> 01:13:56,603
so we keep buying magazines
and joining clubs

1583
01:13:56,642 --> 01:13:58,109
and doing therapy

1584
01:13:58,144 --> 01:14:01,477
and watching movies
with hit pop songs

1585
01:14:01,514 --> 01:14:03,141
played over love montages

1586
01:14:03,182 --> 01:14:06,913
all in this pathetic attempt
to explain why our love Santa

1587
01:14:06,953 --> 01:14:09,218
keeps getting caught
in the chimney.

1588
01:14:11,992 --> 01:14:15,484
Otis always told me
love is a leap.

1589
01:14:15,529 --> 01:14:19,465
Lamentably,
I was never inspired to jump.

1590
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:23,630
By my 30th birthday,
I had, according to my uncle

1591
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:26,833
become a blemish
on the family name.

1592
01:14:26,874 --> 01:14:29,274
So he brought me to this country

1593
01:14:29,309 --> 01:14:32,005
with the proviso
I marry an American.

1594
01:14:32,045 --> 01:14:34,480
A girl
with a good deal of, um...

1595
01:14:34,516 --> 01:14:36,711
Charm?

1596
01:14:36,751 --> 01:14:38,651
Money. Since my parents died

1597
01:14:38,686 --> 01:14:42,315
our family fortune had become,
shall we say, depleted.

1598
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:45,848
I would be married now
if I hadn't followed Stuart.

1599
01:14:45,894 --> 01:14:48,328
I was to announce a bride
that night.

1600
01:14:48,429 --> 01:14:51,694
Who?

1601
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:59,068
I don't know.

1602
01:14:59,108 --> 01:15:01,008
Someone.

1603
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:02,670
One of them.

1604
01:15:14,123 --> 01:15:15,590
What are you doing?

1605
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:18,058
I'm just cleaning up.

1606
01:15:18,093 --> 01:15:20,927
Would you do me
the honor of a dance?

1607
01:15:22,299 --> 01:15:23,960
Please?

1608
01:15:37,547 --> 01:15:40,277
( violin playing
romantic music )

1609
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:51,420
( giggles )

1610
01:15:52,663 --> 01:15:55,325
I am not much of a dancer.

1611
01:15:55,366 --> 01:15:57,857
You're doing famously, then.

1612
01:15:57,902 --> 01:16:00,632
( laughs )

1613
01:16:14,686 --> 01:16:19,214
Leopold, this was lovely.

1614
01:16:19,258 --> 01:16:22,250
But I don't know
if I can leap

1615
01:16:22,294 --> 01:16:24,626
even if I am inspired.

1616
01:16:27,266 --> 01:16:30,031
People might think
I'm brave, but I'm not.

1617
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:33,368
The brave are simply those
with the clearest vision

1618
01:16:33,473 --> 01:16:35,031
of what is before them.

1619
01:16:35,074 --> 01:16:37,065
Glory and danger alike

1620
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:40,602
and notwithstanding,
go out to meet it.

1621
01:16:40,647 --> 01:16:42,740
( music continues )

1622
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:54,083
( ticking )

1623
01:16:55,796 --> 01:16:57,855
( bell dings )

1624
01:16:59,133 --> 01:17:00,327
Hey.

1625
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:02,835
Morning, Charles.

1626
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:05,304
How was your evening
with Patrice?

1627
01:17:05,339 --> 01:17:08,137
Good. Nice.

1628
01:17:09,376 --> 01:17:10,502
How was yours?

1629
01:17:10,544 --> 01:17:13,911
Good. Nice.

1630
01:17:26,428 --> 01:17:29,761
So, Leo, don't you think it's
time you tell me who you are?

1631
01:17:31,066 --> 01:17:32,294
What do you mean?

1632
01:17:32,334 --> 01:17:33,733
I mean...

1633
01:17:33,768 --> 01:17:37,169
it's a blast doing
the duke thing with you 24/7

1634
01:17:37,205 --> 01:17:41,302
but I don't want to see Kate
go through Stuart: The Sequel.

1635
01:17:41,377 --> 01:17:43,504
I know she seems pretty tough

1636
01:17:43,546 --> 01:17:45,912
but she hasn't
had it that easy.

1637
01:17:45,948 --> 01:17:47,643
She's always getting
stuck with people

1638
01:17:47,683 --> 01:17:49,014
who don't hold up their end.

1639
01:17:49,051 --> 01:17:52,282
Like me. I just don't...

1640
01:17:52,321 --> 01:17:54,789
I understand, Charles.

1641
01:17:54,824 --> 01:17:55,848
You do?

1642
01:17:55,891 --> 01:17:57,119
Yes.

1643
01:17:57,159 --> 01:18:00,253
So... who are you?

1644
01:18:04,468 --> 01:18:07,767
I am the man
who loves your sister.

1645
01:18:13,477 --> 01:18:15,741
( dishes rattling )

1646
01:18:15,779 --> 01:18:17,246
CHARLlE:
Okay, door's open.

1647
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,578
Shut the lid.

1648
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:21,106
Push the drawers in.

1649
01:18:21,151 --> 01:18:24,177
Close the door, and
you push this button.

1650
01:18:24,221 --> 01:18:25,620
A word to the wise:

1651
01:18:25,655 --> 01:18:28,250
Don't press that
till she wakes up.

1652
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:30,522
So she sees you doing it.

1653
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:31,550
Oh, clever.

1654
01:18:31,596 --> 01:18:34,497
The proverbial
tree in the woods.

1655
01:18:34,532 --> 01:18:36,363
If a man washes a dish
and no one sees it...

1656
01:18:36,434 --> 01:18:37,492
BOTH:
Did it happen?

1657
01:18:37,535 --> 01:18:38,524
Right.

1658
01:18:49,847 --> 01:18:51,816
A cup of coffee, my dear.

1659
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,784
Thank you.

1660
01:18:57,055 --> 01:18:58,784
Breakfast?

1661
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:08,299
Nine-grain toast
with strawberries

1662
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:10,324
and mascarpone, madame.

1663
01:19:10,402 --> 01:19:17,206
It's apparently low
in polyunsaturates.

1664
01:19:26,686 --> 01:19:28,654
( voice breaking ):
It's really good.

1665
01:19:31,124 --> 01:19:32,614
It's good.

1666
01:19:35,695 --> 01:19:38,494
What should we do today?

1667
01:19:44,371 --> 01:19:47,306
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

1668
01:19:47,341 --> 01:19:49,036
Thank you. No.

1669
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:53,645
You know what makes me happy?

1670
01:19:53,681 --> 01:19:55,080
You don't look good in those.

1671
01:19:55,115 --> 01:19:57,345
They're so completely
inappropriate for you.

1672
01:20:15,036 --> 01:20:18,267
Kate.

1673
01:20:18,306 --> 01:20:20,467
Kate, Kate, come.

1674
01:20:22,911 --> 01:20:26,348
Leopold? Leopold?

1675
01:20:26,382 --> 01:20:27,940
Hey, what are you doing?

1676
01:20:27,984 --> 01:20:29,884
It boggles the mind
that it is still here.

1677
01:20:29,919 --> 01:20:31,181
This is my uncle's home.

1678
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,187
Well, was.

1679
01:20:32,221 --> 01:20:34,189
This is where I lived.
Good Lord.

1680
01:20:34,223 --> 01:20:37,090
A portrait of my parents...
and me.

1681
01:20:38,327 --> 01:20:41,262
Uh... uh, Leopold?

1682
01:20:43,232 --> 01:20:45,029
Look, I just don't think

1683
01:20:45,067 --> 01:20:48,936
that we should just be barging
around here like that.

1684
01:20:48,972 --> 01:20:50,963
Leopold?

1685
01:21:03,453 --> 01:21:05,751
My old quarters.

1686
01:21:16,301 --> 01:21:17,632
KATE:
What are you doing?

1687
01:21:20,838 --> 01:21:22,533
Hey.

1688
01:21:27,645 --> 01:21:30,944
The place where I put
everything I most cared for.

1689
01:21:33,551 --> 01:21:34,779
Hmm.

1690
01:21:36,155 --> 01:21:38,919
Things I didn't want
my uncle to touch.

1691
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:51,066
My mother's ring.

1692
01:21:52,438 --> 01:21:53,928
Oh, it's beautiful.

1693
01:22:05,585 --> 01:22:07,644
KATE:
You know,
I live on an island

1694
01:22:07,687 --> 01:22:11,282
connected to everything
by bridges

1695
01:22:11,324 --> 01:22:13,849
and I never cross them.

1696
01:22:15,261 --> 01:22:17,729
I've lived here for ten years

1697
01:22:17,764 --> 01:22:22,030
and I've never been
to the other side of anything.

1698
01:22:22,068 --> 01:22:24,037
You've never traveled?

1699
01:22:24,071 --> 01:22:25,595
No.

1700
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:40,343
Do you...

1701
01:22:40,454 --> 01:22:42,251
What?

1702
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:48,058
Do you miss where you're from?

1703
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:58,530
In a way, l...

1704
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:04,205
I miss... I miss its rhythm.

1705
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:06,476
It was slower?

1706
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:09,177
Quite a bit slower.

1707
01:23:09,218 --> 01:23:10,185
Like today?

1708
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:11,811
Yes.

1709
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:24,333
# Wherever you're going,
I'm going your way... #

1710
01:23:24,367 --> 01:23:26,096
KATE:
Do you hear that, Leopold?

1711
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:27,830
-Do you hear
that music?
-Yes.

1712
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:30,304
Have you ever seen the movie

1713
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:31,829
Breakfast a Tiffany's?

1714
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:33,035
Uh, no.

1715
01:23:33,077 --> 01:23:34,271
"No."

1716
01:23:34,311 --> 01:23:35,539
( chuckles )

1717
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:37,809
Not yet.

1718
01:23:37,848 --> 01:23:40,942
You see that guy down
there with the light on?

1719
01:23:40,984 --> 01:23:42,451
Mm-hmm.

1720
01:23:42,486 --> 01:23:44,511
He listens to the soundtrack

1721
01:23:44,555 --> 01:23:47,183
of Breakfast at Tiffany's
every night

1722
01:23:47,224 --> 01:23:49,590
until exactly midnight.

1723
01:23:49,626 --> 01:23:52,720
And then he
turns his light off

1724
01:23:52,763 --> 01:23:54,822
goes to sleep.

1725
01:23:54,865 --> 01:23:58,461
# My huckleberry friend #

1726
01:23:58,503 --> 01:24:06,467
# Moon River and me. #

1727
01:24:06,511 --> 01:24:09,639
( music slowly concludes )

1728
01:24:09,681 --> 01:24:13,173
( sighs )

1729
01:24:13,218 --> 01:24:15,982
( church bell tolling )

1730
01:24:18,022 --> 01:24:19,854
Oh, that means it's Sunday.

1731
01:24:19,892 --> 01:24:22,190
Oh, I don't want it
to be Sunday.

1732
01:24:22,228 --> 01:24:24,560
I want more of this.

1733
01:24:24,597 --> 01:24:25,894
More 1 876.

1734
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:30,300
But, Kate,
you don't work on Sundays.

1735
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,826
We can have more.

1736
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:35,637
Well, oh, no,
'cause Sunday is the day before

1737
01:24:35,674 --> 01:24:37,301
the day I work, so...

1738
01:24:37,343 --> 01:24:40,335
( yawning ):
it gets poisoned.

1739
01:24:40,379 --> 01:24:43,281
( softly ):
I see.

1740
01:24:43,316 --> 01:24:46,114
Besides, tomorrow is the day

1741
01:24:46,153 --> 01:24:49,213
we shoot your commercial.

1742
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:51,918
( church bell tolling )

1743
01:25:00,467 --> 01:25:01,764
Kate.

1744
01:25:01,802 --> 01:25:03,292
Hmm?

1745
01:25:03,336 --> 01:25:07,603
Would you...?

1746
01:25:07,642 --> 01:25:13,274
Might you ever... consider...?

1747
01:25:13,314 --> 01:25:15,111
Hmm?

1748
01:25:23,691 --> 01:25:26,387
It's time for bed.

1749
01:25:29,897 --> 01:25:32,389
Oh.

1750
01:25:32,434 --> 01:25:34,061
( Kate sighs )

1751
01:25:34,102 --> 01:25:35,899
I'm so relaxed.

1752
01:25:35,938 --> 01:25:37,929
That's all right.

1753
01:25:49,785 --> 01:25:52,549
( sighs )

1754
01:25:56,593 --> 01:25:58,220
Oh...

1755
01:25:58,261 --> 01:26:00,092
You're tucking me in.

1756
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:01,653
Yes.

1757
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:04,758
Huh, you're my Otis.

1758
01:26:04,801 --> 01:26:06,769
Yes, Your Grace.

1759
01:26:12,909 --> 01:26:14,604
Oh, wait.

1760
01:26:14,644 --> 01:26:17,671
Hey, hey, don't...
don't go upstairs.

1761
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:19,273
Stay.

1762
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:43,366
# #

1763
01:26:45,977 --> 01:26:47,968
( sighs )

1764
01:27:04,597 --> 01:27:07,862
( whispering ):
I love you, Kate McKay.

1765
01:27:19,412 --> 01:27:21,972
Scone, Your Grace?

1766
01:27:22,014 --> 01:27:23,345
Ah, thank you, Millard.

1767
01:27:23,382 --> 01:27:26,010
And you brought
the Farmer's Bounty?

1768
01:27:26,052 --> 01:27:28,044
But of course.

1769
01:27:28,088 --> 01:27:30,989
Ah!

1770
01:27:31,024 --> 01:27:32,355
Fresh creamery butter.

1771
01:27:32,392 --> 01:27:35,259
Is there anything
more comforting?

1772
01:27:35,295 --> 01:27:36,592
I say there is

1773
01:27:36,630 --> 01:27:38,723
and perhaps you'll agree

1774
01:27:38,765 --> 01:27:42,201
when you sample fat-free
Farmer's Bounty

1775
01:27:42,235 --> 01:27:45,932
with the genuine essence
of creamery butter

1776
01:27:45,973 --> 01:27:47,270
in every bite.

1777
01:27:47,307 --> 01:27:50,276
With every mouthful
of Farmer's Bounty

1778
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:52,245
you shall receive butter's
luxurious comfort

1779
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,577
in your mouth

1780
01:27:53,614 --> 01:27:56,674
without adding to the luxury
of your waistline.

1781
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:58,618
-( chuckling )
-Farmer's Bounty.

1782
01:27:58,653 --> 01:28:00,245
DlRECTOR:
Now, on this one

1783
01:28:00,288 --> 01:28:03,018
take a bite and smile.

1784
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,886
And... cut!

1785
01:28:06,928 --> 01:28:08,361
All right, check gate.

1786
01:28:08,396 --> 01:28:10,591
-Good enough for me.
-( bell rings )

1787
01:28:10,631 --> 01:28:12,656
Can we get a Dedo up here
and something...

1788
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:13,997
Oh, excuse me.

1789
01:28:14,035 --> 01:28:18,336
Excuse me. Is this an actual
sample of Farmer's Bounty?

1790
01:28:18,374 --> 01:28:19,864
DlRECTOR:
Yeah. Why?

1791
01:28:19,908 --> 01:28:22,206
This tastes like saddle soap.

1792
01:28:22,244 --> 01:28:24,109
Well, that's not really
your concern, now, is it?

1793
01:28:24,146 --> 01:28:25,374
Not my concern?

1794
01:28:25,481 --> 01:28:27,574
This product tastes
like raw suet.

1795
01:28:27,616 --> 01:28:29,379
How is that not my concern?

1796
01:28:29,418 --> 01:28:31,386
Hey, pal, it's a paycheck!

1797
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:32,682
Wait a minute.
-LEOPOLD:
Paycheck?

1798
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:33,779
A... This is an outrage!

1799
01:28:33,822 --> 01:28:35,289
PHlL:
Don't worry about the taste.

1800
01:28:35,324 --> 01:28:36,757
Come back.
We need another shot.

1801
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:39,284
DlRECTOR:
Something that brings
the light up on this...

1802
01:28:45,301 --> 01:28:47,292
Leopold.

1803
01:28:47,337 --> 01:28:48,634
Leopold!

1804
01:28:48,671 --> 01:28:50,696
Hey! Leopold, what's going on?

1805
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:52,071
What are you doing?

1806
01:28:52,108 --> 01:28:54,338
They-they need you
back in there.

1807
01:28:54,444 --> 01:28:55,604
Do they?

1808
01:28:55,645 --> 01:28:58,341
Yeah. They have to shoot
the rest of the spot.

1809
01:28:58,381 --> 01:28:59,905
They're not finished yet.

1810
01:28:59,949 --> 01:29:01,678
Well, I want no part of it.

1811
01:29:01,719 --> 01:29:03,209
Why?

1812
01:29:03,254 --> 01:29:04,846
Have you tasted it?

1813
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:06,049
Farmer's Bounty?

1814
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,352
Yes, Farmer's Bounty.

1815
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:08,823
Yeah, I've tasted it.

1816
01:29:08,859 --> 01:29:10,156
It's revolting.

1817
01:29:10,194 --> 01:29:12,162
I know.

1818
01:29:12,196 --> 01:29:13,493
You know it's revolting

1819
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:15,931
yet you have no qualms
enlisting me to endorse it?

1820
01:29:15,966 --> 01:29:18,366
It's diet;
it's supposed to be awful.

1821
01:29:18,469 --> 01:29:20,369
I mean, what is the problem?

1822
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:22,065
The problem is
that for no reason

1823
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:23,471
beyond my affection for you

1824
01:29:23,507 --> 01:29:26,534
I find myself peddling pond scum
to an unsuspecting public.

1825
01:29:26,578 --> 01:29:27,704
Hey, listen, you know

1826
01:29:27,746 --> 01:29:29,509
the stakes are very high
for me here.

1827
01:29:29,548 --> 01:29:31,015
You can't just quit because...

1828
01:29:31,049 --> 01:29:32,346
Yes, I can. And so can you.

1829
01:29:32,384 --> 01:29:34,113
When one finds oneself
participating

1830
01:29:34,152 --> 01:29:37,383
in an endeavor entirely
without merit, one withdraws.

1831
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:38,650
No. No. Because sometimes

1832
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:40,715
you have to do things
that you don't like.

1833
01:29:40,759 --> 01:29:43,751
Sometimes you have to suck it up
and finish what you started.

1834
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,092
It's part of life.

1835
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:48,566
You sound like my uncle.

1836
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,068
Look, Leopold, Jansen Foods is

1837
01:29:50,103 --> 01:29:52,094
a very important
account for my company.

1838
01:29:52,138 --> 01:29:53,571
If you don't go back in there

1839
01:29:53,606 --> 01:29:55,267
then I get into
a lot of trouble.

1840
01:29:55,308 --> 01:29:57,868
Is this what you do
at work, Kate?

1841
01:29:57,910 --> 01:30:00,538
Research methods
to deceive people?

1842
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:03,481
Refine lies until
they resemble truth?

1843
01:30:03,516 --> 01:30:05,074
It's no wonder
you dread your work week.

1844
01:30:05,118 --> 01:30:07,450
Oh! Man, I don't have time
for this.

1845
01:30:07,487 --> 01:30:09,512
What has happened to the world?

1846
01:30:09,555 --> 01:30:12,252
You have every convenience,
every comfort

1847
01:30:12,292 --> 01:30:14,055
yet no time for integrity.

1848
01:30:14,094 --> 01:30:16,927
No. What I don't have time for
are pious speeches

1849
01:30:16,964 --> 01:30:18,261
by 200-year-old men

1850
01:30:18,298 --> 01:30:20,289
who've never had to work
a day in their life.

1851
01:30:20,334 --> 01:30:22,359
You have no idea
what I've done with my life.

1852
01:30:22,436 --> 01:30:25,803
And you-you have no idea
what I've done with mine!

1853
01:30:25,839 --> 01:30:29,366
I haven't had all that many
comforts and conveniences

1854
01:30:29,476 --> 01:30:33,071
Leopold, because I've been
paying dues all of my life

1855
01:30:33,113 --> 01:30:35,172
and I'm tired,
and I need a rest

1856
01:30:35,215 --> 01:30:36,706
and if I have to peddle

1857
01:30:36,751 --> 01:30:38,685
a little pond scum to get one

1858
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,914
then so be it.

1859
01:30:44,325 --> 01:30:45,656
Very well.

1860
01:30:49,297 --> 01:30:51,288
( traffic noises )

1861
01:30:54,636 --> 01:30:57,605
We're kidding ourselves,
Leopold.

1862
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,340
In point of fact

1863
01:31:00,376 --> 01:31:04,540
I don't even really know
who you are.

1864
01:31:06,815 --> 01:31:10,546
You still don't believe
I'm the man I say I am?

1865
01:31:12,121 --> 01:31:14,681
We had a great weekend;
that's that.

1866
01:31:14,723 --> 01:31:16,213
And now it's Sunday.

1867
01:31:16,258 --> 01:31:18,886
It's over.

1868
01:31:28,538 --> 01:31:32,668
( "Moon River" melody plays )

1869
01:31:38,415 --> 01:31:45,480
# There's such a lot of world
to see... #

1870
01:31:53,564 --> 01:31:54,532
( dice rattling )

1871
01:31:54,532 --> 01:31:55,521
( dice rattling )

1872
01:31:55,566 --> 01:31:57,557
( dice spilling )

1873
01:31:58,569 --> 01:32:00,867
( dice rattling )

1874
01:32:00,905 --> 01:32:03,772
( dice spilling )

1875
01:32:04,775 --> 01:32:07,676
( rattling )

1876
01:32:07,712 --> 01:32:11,240
( spilling )

1877
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:14,185
( rattling )

1878
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:16,210
( spilling )

1879
01:32:17,222 --> 01:32:21,249
( rattling )

1880
01:32:21,293 --> 01:32:23,261
( dice scatter )

1881
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:39,808
I know.

1882
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:41,814
( stifled laughter )

1883
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:44,373
I know, I know,
it sounds crazy--

1884
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:49,387
talking about... finding a crack
in time under the East River.

1885
01:32:49,455 --> 01:32:52,151
( laughing )

1886
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:58,392
But in, in point,
in point fact, Gretchen

1887
01:32:58,432 --> 01:33:00,627
you know... ( sighs )

1888
01:33:00,668 --> 01:33:06,300
it is no more crazy than, uh,
a dog finding a rainbow.

1889
01:33:07,675 --> 01:33:10,644
Dogs are color-blind, Gretchen.

1890
01:33:10,678 --> 01:33:12,805
They don't see color.

1891
01:33:12,846 --> 01:33:14,245
Really?

1892
01:33:14,281 --> 01:33:15,873
Just like we can't see time.

1893
01:33:15,916 --> 01:33:17,213
We can feel it.

1894
01:33:17,251 --> 01:33:19,412
Oh... we can feel it passing

1895
01:33:19,486 --> 01:33:22,422
but, uh, we can't see it;
it's just a blur.

1896
01:33:22,524 --> 01:33:26,187
It's like, uh...

1897
01:33:26,227 --> 01:33:30,027
it's like we're riding
in a, in a supersonic train

1898
01:33:30,065 --> 01:33:32,761
and the world is
just blowing by.

1899
01:33:32,801 --> 01:33:37,670
But imagine if we could stop
that train, Gretchen. Hmm?

1900
01:33:37,706 --> 01:33:39,674
lmagine if we could stop
that train

1901
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:42,268
get out, look around

1902
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:44,575
and see time
for what it really is.

1903
01:33:44,613 --> 01:33:48,743
A universe, a world

1904
01:33:48,784 --> 01:33:53,619
a thing as unimaginable
as color to a dog.

1905
01:33:53,656 --> 01:33:58,958
And as real and tangible
as that chair you're sitting in.

1906
01:34:00,329 --> 01:34:03,355
Now, if we could see it
like that

1907
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:05,765
I mean, really look at it

1908
01:34:05,801 --> 01:34:13,709
then... maybe we could see
the flaws as well as the form.

1909
01:34:13,744 --> 01:34:15,939
( snickers )

1910
01:34:15,979 --> 01:34:18,379
And that's it.

1911
01:34:18,415 --> 01:34:19,575
It's that simple.

1912
01:34:19,616 --> 01:34:21,914
That's all I discovered.

1913
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,214
I'm just a...

1914
01:34:23,253 --> 01:34:27,280
just a guy who saw a crack
in a chair

1915
01:34:27,324 --> 01:34:29,053
that no one else could see.

1916
01:34:30,627 --> 01:34:35,292
I'm that dog who saw a rainbow.

1917
01:34:35,333 --> 01:34:39,463
Only, uh...

1918
01:34:40,872 --> 01:34:43,739
none of the other dogs
believe me.

1919
01:34:47,378 --> 01:34:49,539
( whispering ):
I believe you.

1920
01:35:10,869 --> 01:35:12,894
( dog barks )

1921
01:35:33,493 --> 01:35:40,365
I can see that some things have
happened since I went away.

1922
01:35:40,467 --> 01:35:42,459
But...

1923
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:48,070
you have to go back.

1924
01:36:13,668 --> 01:36:15,932
You understand
you'll be going back

1925
01:36:15,971 --> 01:36:18,405
to the same day
you left, April 28.

1926
01:36:18,473 --> 01:36:19,770
Yes.

1927
01:36:19,808 --> 01:36:21,002
So you understand

1928
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:23,237
you might be repeating
a few things.

1929
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:24,745
You might even see me.

1930
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:27,441
Just don't follow me
this time.

1931
01:36:31,821 --> 01:36:34,312
Can I go in?

1932
01:36:37,126 --> 01:36:40,357
J.J., you asked to see me?

1933
01:36:40,396 --> 01:36:42,159
Come on in.

1934
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:46,999
I understand you, uh,
put out a fire

1935
01:36:47,036 --> 01:36:48,333
at the shoot yesterday.

1936
01:36:48,371 --> 01:36:50,805
Guess Mr. Duke's got a bit
of an ego on him, huh?

1937
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,934
Yeah.

1938
01:36:52,976 --> 01:36:54,375
( clears throat )

1939
01:36:54,444 --> 01:36:56,241
I'm going to England
this week

1940
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:57,679
and I made a decision.

1941
01:36:57,714 --> 01:36:58,976
Mm-hmm.

1942
01:36:59,016 --> 01:37:02,349
You're going to be
the top New York honcho.

1943
01:37:02,386 --> 01:37:06,652
So, this is going
to be your office.

1944
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:08,954
I'll be making it official
tonight.

1945
01:37:10,994 --> 01:37:12,256
Thank you, J.J.

1946
01:37:12,296 --> 01:37:13,627
Thank you.

1947
01:37:13,664 --> 01:37:15,565
You've earned it.

1948
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,660
I'm heading over
to Jansen to sign

1949
01:37:18,703 --> 01:37:21,171
the buy-out papers,
FTC stuff.

1950
01:37:21,205 --> 01:37:24,140
So I'll see you later
at the thing.

1951
01:37:24,342 --> 01:37:26,333
What did he say?
-I got it.

1952
01:37:26,377 --> 01:37:27,674
Oh, my God,
that's wonderful!

1953
01:37:27,712 --> 01:37:28,736
Just give me one second,

1954
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:30,008
I'm sorry, Darci. One second.

1955
01:37:30,048 --> 01:37:31,879
( sighs )

1956
01:37:32,884 --> 01:37:34,181
( Touch-Tone beeps )

1957
01:37:34,218 --> 01:37:35,981
( on machine ):
Hi. You've reached Stuart.

1958
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:37,146
Please leave a message.

1959
01:37:37,188 --> 01:37:38,155
( beep )

1960
01:37:38,189 --> 01:37:39,458
Hello?

1961
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:41,949
Leopold, l-I don't know
where you are

1962
01:37:41,994 --> 01:37:44,292
but if you're there,
please pick up.

1963
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:48,130
I got it.

1964
01:37:48,167 --> 01:37:50,294
I got the job.

1965
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:54,136
I'm the new
senior vice president

1966
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:55,968
at CRG.

1967
01:37:56,008 --> 01:37:57,976
Uh, please call me.

1968
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:02,003
l, um... I'm sorry about the way
things came down yesterday.

1969
01:38:02,047 --> 01:38:03,015
I apologize.

1970
01:38:03,049 --> 01:38:05,244
l, uh... I just really
need to see you.

1971
01:38:05,285 --> 01:38:06,843
I'd love to see you tonight

1972
01:38:06,886 --> 01:38:09,150
but I have this thing
at Farmer's Bounty.

1973
01:38:09,222 --> 01:38:10,985
But I'd love to see you later.

1974
01:38:11,024 --> 01:38:12,821
I miss you.

1975
01:38:13,827 --> 01:38:15,351
I miss you.

1976
01:38:17,797 --> 01:38:19,765
Hey, Stuart.

1977
01:38:19,799 --> 01:38:21,926
How you feeling?

1978
01:38:24,804 --> 01:38:27,137
( piano playing softly )

1979
01:38:30,011 --> 01:38:31,945
Where's Leo?

1980
01:38:31,979 --> 01:38:34,539
He went home.

1981
01:39:04,579 --> 01:39:06,240
He was for real.

1982
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:10,841
He was for real.

1983
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:24,660
Holy shit!

1984
01:39:25,868 --> 01:39:27,358
Look at this!

1985
01:39:37,915 --> 01:39:39,678
Oh, my God.

1986
01:39:46,423 --> 01:39:48,948
MlLLARD:
Chilled, do you understand?
Chilled.

1987
01:39:48,992 --> 01:39:51,893
And be sure to leave another
case of the Chateau Marid.

1988
01:39:51,929 --> 01:39:52,896
Yes, sir.

1989
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:54,056
Leopold!

1990
01:39:54,098 --> 01:39:55,429
Leopold!

1991
01:39:55,466 --> 01:39:56,626
Where have you been?!

1992
01:39:56,667 --> 01:39:58,862
MlLLARD:
Otis, I demand explication!

1993
01:39:58,902 --> 01:40:00,131
It's half past 5:00!

1994
01:40:00,238 --> 01:40:01,227
He's not even dressed!

1995
01:40:01,272 --> 01:40:03,137
He'll be ready, my lord,
I assure you.

1996
01:40:03,174 --> 01:40:04,505
I don't want him ready.

1997
01:40:04,542 --> 01:40:05,873
I want him resplendent!

1998
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:06,877
Here's the invitation.

1999
01:40:06,911 --> 01:40:08,811
You've got your table number,
your car number

2000
01:40:08,847 --> 01:40:10,974
and I've got Morty down there--
the guy you like.

2001
01:40:11,015 --> 01:40:12,073
He's on the Madison side.

2002
01:40:12,117 --> 01:40:13,550
Also, your phone sheet
is in here.

2003
01:40:13,585 --> 01:40:15,143
And Stuart called
you a couple times.

2004
01:40:15,220 --> 01:40:17,017
So, have a great time tonight.

2005
01:40:17,055 --> 01:40:18,716
You look beautiful.

2006
01:40:56,029 --> 01:40:57,860
I don't think this is right.

2007
01:40:57,898 --> 01:41:00,526
I'm supposed to be
going to 2640 Madison.

2008
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:02,558
That's where we are,
Miss McKay.

2009
01:41:04,638 --> 01:41:06,606
Have a nice evening.

2010
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,607
Hi.

2011
01:41:07,641 --> 01:41:08,733
Hello.

2012
01:41:08,775 --> 01:41:10,072
lnvitation, please.

2013
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:11,271
Yes.

2014
01:41:11,312 --> 01:41:13,303
( lively chatter and laughter )

2015
01:41:17,185 --> 01:41:19,119
They're still plugs.

2016
01:41:19,153 --> 01:41:21,280
They're just randomly seeded
with Minoxidil.

2017
01:41:21,322 --> 01:41:22,346
No cornrows.

2018
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:23,414
Excuse me.

2019
01:41:23,457 --> 01:41:24,481
Hey, Kate.

2020
01:41:24,525 --> 01:41:25,651
Congratulations.

2021
01:41:25,693 --> 01:41:26,819
Thank you.

2022
01:41:26,861 --> 01:41:28,692
WOMAN:
The hell with facelifts.

2023
01:41:28,729 --> 01:41:30,060
I'm into mini-lifts now.

2024
01:41:30,097 --> 01:41:31,997
Just a tiny little bit
each year.

2025
01:41:32,033 --> 01:41:34,002
I hear they're bringing
back the 840 next year.

2026
01:41:34,036 --> 01:41:35,435
So I'm just running
out the lease.

2027
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:36,903
-Kate, congratulations.
-Thanks, Bob.

2028
01:41:36,939 --> 01:41:38,907
Hey, Kate.

2029
01:41:38,941 --> 01:41:40,636
-Congratulations.
-J.J. Hi, Barry.

2030
01:41:40,676 --> 01:41:42,109
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

2031
01:41:42,211 --> 01:41:44,975
Anyway, I'm just glad
they've got them fixed.

2032
01:41:45,013 --> 01:41:47,846
I was going to move my office
down to the lobby.

2033
01:41:47,883 --> 01:41:48,850
( laughter)

2034
01:41:48,884 --> 01:41:51,114
Excuse me.

2035
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:54,018
J.J.:
Kate, don't powder
your nose for too long.

2036
01:41:54,056 --> 01:41:55,785
I'm going to
give this speech

2037
01:41:55,824 --> 01:41:57,121
in a couple minutes.

2038
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:59,151
Okay.

2039
01:42:00,997 --> 01:42:03,932
All this time I thought
that I had pretzled fate

2040
01:42:03,967 --> 01:42:05,628
and it had to be untwisted.

2041
01:42:05,668 --> 01:42:07,329
But what I never considered

2042
01:42:07,370 --> 01:42:09,770
is that the whole thing
is a pretzel.

2043
01:42:09,806 --> 01:42:12,604
A beautiful 4D pretzel
of kismetic inevitability.

2044
01:42:12,642 --> 01:42:14,234
Okay, you know what,
get off Park

2045
01:42:14,277 --> 01:42:16,438
as soon as you can,
and then go up Madison.

2046
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:18,140
I was supposed to go back.

2047
01:42:18,214 --> 01:42:20,239
He was supposed to come forward

2048
01:42:20,283 --> 01:42:23,253
then he was supposed
to go back again and...

2049
01:42:23,287 --> 01:42:25,414
so was she.

2050
01:42:25,456 --> 01:42:27,424
( muted applause )

2051
01:42:27,458 --> 01:42:29,892
MlLLARD:
Now it is my pleasure
and honor...

2052
01:42:29,927 --> 01:42:33,590
( voice trailing off)

2053
01:42:33,631 --> 01:42:36,293
( applause )

2054
01:42:46,478 --> 01:42:49,038
MlLLARD:
...to take priests
to the bell tower.

2055
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,446
You speak of progress
and invention.

2056
01:42:51,483 --> 01:42:54,919
But what I offer you
downstairs is reality.

2057
01:42:54,953 --> 01:42:56,750
Take a wife.

2058
01:42:56,788 --> 01:42:57,755
Marry.

2059
01:42:57,789 --> 01:43:00,189
Let us not bother
with this banter, Uncle.

2060
01:43:00,292 --> 01:43:02,283
Tell me whom you want me
to marry.

2061
01:43:02,327 --> 01:43:03,726
Well, who has the most money.

2062
01:43:03,762 --> 01:43:08,530
Well... that would be Miss Tree
of the Trees of Schenectady.

2063
01:43:08,567 --> 01:43:09,534
Good.

2064
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:11,195
Consider it done.

2065
01:43:11,237 --> 01:43:13,205
Otis, fetch the ring.

2066
01:43:13,239 --> 01:43:15,867
I will announce at midnight.

2067
01:43:15,908 --> 01:43:17,375
lnvitation, please.

2068
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:18,377
Uh, hello.

2069
01:43:18,411 --> 01:43:19,537
My name is Stuart Besser.

2070
01:43:19,578 --> 01:43:21,409
I'm sorry, I know
we're not on your list

2071
01:43:21,447 --> 01:43:23,540
but his sister is Kate McKay;
she works here.

2072
01:43:23,582 --> 01:43:26,312
I'm sorry, sir,
I can't just let you in.

2073
01:43:26,352 --> 01:43:29,788
( screaming )

2074
01:43:30,990 --> 01:43:34,358
...and I learned that there was
one thing that I could do

2075
01:43:34,394 --> 01:43:36,021
and it didn't require money

2076
01:43:36,063 --> 01:43:38,224
and it didn't require
a fancy school.

2077
01:43:38,265 --> 01:43:40,392
I learned that I could
please people.

2078
01:43:40,434 --> 01:43:43,961
And there is nothing wrong
with that!

2079
01:43:44,004 --> 01:43:46,495
I am a people pleaser, people!

2080
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:47,529
Whoo!

2081
01:43:49,176 --> 01:43:51,076
J.J.:
Thank you so much.

2082
01:43:51,111 --> 01:43:52,078
I am so...

2083
01:43:52,112 --> 01:43:53,170
Kate!

2084
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,611
Stuart!

2085
01:43:54,648 --> 01:43:56,139
Charlie! What are you doing?

2086
01:43:56,184 --> 01:43:58,175
Take a look
at these pictures, Kate.

2087
01:43:58,219 --> 01:43:59,550
No! No-no-no-no!

2088
01:43:59,587 --> 01:44:01,418
Now it's time
to introduce the woman

2089
01:44:01,456 --> 01:44:04,755
who's going to be holding down
the fort in our New York offices

2090
01:44:04,792 --> 01:44:07,090
our own little rising star,
Miss Kate McKay!

2091
01:44:07,128 --> 01:44:08,789
Just listen to me
for a second, okay, please?

2092
01:44:08,830 --> 01:44:10,457
They're introducing me
downstairs right now!

2093
01:44:10,498 --> 01:44:11,760
I'm sorry I was
a lousy boyfriend.

2094
01:44:11,799 --> 01:44:12,925
I'm sorry I let you down.

2095
01:44:12,967 --> 01:44:15,128
I know all you wanted
was someone you could trust...

2096
01:44:15,169 --> 01:44:16,363
Oh, Stuart, really

2097
01:44:16,404 --> 01:44:18,430
I can't talk about
our relationship right now.

2098
01:44:18,474 --> 01:44:20,374
No, Kate, just listen
to me, okay? Please.

2099
01:44:20,409 --> 01:44:22,969
Maybe we weren't such
a waste of time after all.

2100
01:44:23,012 --> 01:44:25,503
I mean, maybe there's
a reason I was your guy.

2101
01:44:25,547 --> 01:44:26,980
What are you talking about?

2102
01:44:27,016 --> 01:44:31,476
Maybe I was supposed to help
you find your guy... Leopold.

2103
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,785
You got to go back, Kate.

2104
01:44:34,823 --> 01:44:36,688
You got to go back there.

2105
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:39,993
Go back?

2106
01:44:40,029 --> 01:44:41,657
How?

2107
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:44,258
You have to jump
off the Brooklyn Bridge

2108
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:46,063
within the next 23 minutes.

2109
01:44:46,102 --> 01:44:48,434
J.J.
Kate?

2110
01:44:48,471 --> 01:44:49,938
Oh...

2111
01:44:49,973 --> 01:44:52,305
Kate, just look
at the pictures, okay?

2112
01:44:52,342 --> 01:44:54,503
( classical music playing )

2113
01:45:08,626 --> 01:45:10,651
Is there a... a Kate McKay
in the house?

2114
01:45:10,694 --> 01:45:11,991
KATE:
Yeah. Here I am!

2115
01:45:12,029 --> 01:45:13,018
J.J.:
Kate?

2116
01:45:15,032 --> 01:45:16,659
Here she is. Here she is.

2117
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:17,997
( applause )

2118
01:45:18,035 --> 01:45:20,026
J.J.:
Well, without further ado

2119
01:45:20,071 --> 01:45:23,529
the new senior vice president
of our New York offices.

2120
01:45:23,574 --> 01:45:26,600
Here she is, ladies and
gentlemen-- Kate McKay.

2121
01:45:28,947 --> 01:45:30,209
Whoa, whoa! Whoa.

2122
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:31,408
You okay?

2123
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:32,417
Yeah.

2124
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:33,418
I'm sorry.

2125
01:45:33,452 --> 01:45:34,749
Thank you.

2126
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:36,219
Quite an entrance, huh?

2127
01:45:36,254 --> 01:45:37,221
Thank you, J.J.

2128
01:45:37,255 --> 01:45:38,381
Thank you very much.

2129
01:45:38,423 --> 01:45:39,651
Thank you. Thank you.

2130
01:45:39,691 --> 01:45:41,454
Wow.

2131
01:45:41,493 --> 01:45:45,395
KATE:
Well, it's a great night.

2132
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:48,957
We here at CRG have always
considered ourselves

2133
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,266
to be in the "Find what
people want" business

2134
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:53,932
and at Jansen, you guys are

2135
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:56,737
in the "Make what
people want" business.

2136
01:45:56,776 --> 01:45:59,370
So, imagine
what we can do together.

2137
01:45:59,412 --> 01:46:04,440
We'll be able to find out
exactly what people want

2138
01:46:04,484 --> 01:46:06,179
and make it... for them.

2139
01:46:06,219 --> 01:46:09,780
So... yeah, so our customers...

2140
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:13,588
will be able to get exactly...

2141
01:46:14,927 --> 01:46:16,919
Uh...

2142
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:21,824
...what they...

2143
01:46:24,638 --> 01:46:26,970
...they want.

2144
01:46:52,834 --> 01:46:54,699
And, uh...

2145
01:46:57,138 --> 01:47:01,302
...it's a great thing to...
to get what you want.

2146
01:47:01,342 --> 01:47:02,901
Uh, it's a really good thing.

2147
01:47:02,945 --> 01:47:05,505
Unless what you thought
you wanted wasn't really

2148
01:47:05,548 --> 01:47:07,812
what you wanted
because what you really...

2149
01:47:08,984 --> 01:47:11,179
...wanted

2150
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:16,419
you couldn't imagine, or you
didn't think it was possible.

2151
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:22,363
But... but what if someone
came along who knew

2152
01:47:22,398 --> 01:47:25,060
exactly what you wanted
without asking?

2153
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:26,124
They just knew.

2154
01:47:26,169 --> 01:47:29,434
Like they could...
hear your heart beating

2155
01:47:29,472 --> 01:47:31,406
or listen to your thoughts.

2156
01:47:31,441 --> 01:47:34,569
And what if they were sure
of themselves

2157
01:47:34,611 --> 01:47:37,444
and they didn't have
to take a poll

2158
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:40,040
and they loved you...

2159
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:42,483
and you hesitated?

2160
01:47:44,154 --> 01:47:46,884
Uh...

2161
01:47:46,923 --> 01:47:52,658
And... I have to go.

2162
01:47:52,697 --> 01:47:57,828
l, uh... I'm sorry,
but I have to go.

2163
01:47:59,637 --> 01:48:00,968
Kate?

2164
01:48:06,544 --> 01:48:09,411
KATE:
Stuart, can you tell me

2165
01:48:09,447 --> 01:48:11,915
in short, complete sentences

2166
01:48:11,949 --> 01:48:13,884
featuring no words
over two syllables

2167
01:48:13,919 --> 01:48:15,910
why exactly
I am in these pictures?

2168
01:48:15,954 --> 01:48:16,943
Probably not.

2169
01:48:16,989 --> 01:48:18,013
Try.

2170
01:48:18,056 --> 01:48:19,284
-Because you were there.
-I wasn't.

2171
01:48:19,324 --> 01:48:20,348
I would remember.

2172
01:48:20,392 --> 01:48:21,689
Believe me, I would remember

2173
01:48:21,727 --> 01:48:23,456
-if I was there.
-Because you're
going to be there.

2174
01:48:23,495 --> 01:48:24,860
If we get there in time.

2175
01:48:24,896 --> 01:48:27,763
These are pictures
of the past, not the future.

2176
01:48:27,799 --> 01:48:28,925
Not exactly.

2177
01:48:28,967 --> 01:48:30,025
Theoretically speaking

2178
01:48:30,068 --> 01:48:31,535
if you go to the past
in the future

2179
01:48:31,570 --> 01:48:33,094
then your future
lies in the past.

2180
01:48:33,138 --> 01:48:34,867
And that is a picture of you

2181
01:48:34,906 --> 01:48:36,670
in the future in the past.

2182
01:48:36,709 --> 01:48:40,167
We have to make a run
for it. Let's go.

2183
01:48:41,948 --> 01:48:44,246
Come on, come on.

2184
01:48:44,284 --> 01:48:45,945
Let's go, let's go. Come on!

2185
01:48:45,985 --> 01:48:47,885
Whoa, where the hell do
you think you're going?

2186
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,945
$6.80 on the meter, pal.

2187
01:48:51,391 --> 01:48:53,416
It's going to close, Kate!
Come on!

2188
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:05,163
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

2189
01:49:05,239 --> 01:49:07,298
The Duke of Albany
will be making

2190
01:49:07,341 --> 01:49:09,309
a very important announcement
in 20 minutes

2191
01:49:09,343 --> 01:49:11,368
from this very stage.

2192
01:49:11,412 --> 01:49:13,607
And I believe it shall be
an announcement

2193
01:49:13,647 --> 01:49:17,913
that will justify
the playing of a bridal waltz.

2194
01:49:26,127 --> 01:49:27,560
Okay...

2195
01:49:27,595 --> 01:49:28,619
this is the hard part.

2196
01:49:28,663 --> 01:49:29,994
What?
-The girder.

2197
01:49:30,031 --> 01:49:30,998
The girder?

2198
01:49:31,032 --> 01:49:32,465
You have to cross
the girder, Kate.

2199
01:49:35,103 --> 01:49:36,468
That girder?

2200
01:49:37,806 --> 01:49:39,474
Stuart, I can't cross
that girder.

2201
01:49:39,474 --> 01:49:41,271
-I can't go across...
-You love him, right?

2202
01:49:41,309 --> 01:49:42,333
What?

2203
01:49:42,377 --> 01:49:44,538
Leopold.

2204
01:49:44,579 --> 01:49:46,479
You love him, right?

2205
01:49:48,317 --> 01:49:49,750
Yeah.

2206
01:49:49,785 --> 01:49:52,811
That's all you need to know.
Now go.

2207
01:49:52,855 --> 01:49:54,755
-You'll be fine.
-Katie...

2208
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:56,451
Charlie... Charlie,
what am l...

2209
01:49:56,492 --> 01:49:57,584
How are you...

2210
01:49:57,626 --> 01:49:59,389
No, don't worry about me.

2211
01:49:59,428 --> 01:50:00,452
( clock chimes )

2212
01:50:00,496 --> 01:50:02,396
-Now, Kate, now.
-Now?

2213
01:50:02,431 --> 01:50:03,455
The portal's going to close.

2214
01:50:03,499 --> 01:50:04,989
-All right.
-Go.

2215
01:50:05,034 --> 01:50:07,025
( clock chiming )

2216
01:50:07,069 --> 01:50:08,366
-Jesus.
Whoo!

2217
01:50:09,572 --> 01:50:10,699
Oh, God.

2218
01:50:10,741 --> 01:50:11,833
You can do it.

2219
01:50:11,875 --> 01:50:13,433
( clock chimes )

2220
01:50:13,477 --> 01:50:14,535
Don't look down.

2221
01:50:17,981 --> 01:50:19,608
( groans )

2222
01:50:23,086 --> 01:50:25,418
( clock chimes )

2223
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:32,758
( clock chimes )

2224
01:50:37,001 --> 01:50:38,696
Charlie...

2225
01:50:40,805 --> 01:50:43,797
I'll love you forever.

2226
01:50:43,841 --> 01:50:46,935
Love you.

2227
01:50:49,514 --> 01:50:52,210
It's okay.

2228
01:50:55,686 --> 01:50:56,983
( clock chimes )

2229
01:50:57,021 --> 01:50:59,149
Lady... lady, what
are you doing?

2230
01:50:59,258 --> 01:51:00,156
Step back, lady.

2231
01:51:00,259 --> 01:51:01,783
-It's okay.
-Step back from there, lady.

2232
01:51:01,827 --> 01:51:02,885
Come back, lady.

2233
01:51:06,665 --> 01:51:07,757
Central, be advised

2234
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,097
This is Breech Post Four.

2235
01:51:09,134 --> 01:51:10,362
I've got a jumper

2236
01:51:10,402 --> 01:51:12,165
on the southwest location
of the bridge.

2237
01:51:12,271 --> 01:51:14,296
Have a supervisor,
ESU and Harbor respond

2238
01:51:14,339 --> 01:51:16,204
to this location forthwith.

2239
01:51:21,448 --> 01:51:24,110
( clock chiming )

2240
01:51:36,830 --> 01:51:39,094
MlLLARD:
Ladies and gentlemen

2241
01:51:39,132 --> 01:51:41,100
it is with a glad heart
and a bright eye

2242
01:51:41,134 --> 01:51:43,864
that I proudly introduce
my beloved nephew

2243
01:51:43,903 --> 01:51:45,599
Leopold, Duke of Albany.

2244
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:48,472
LEOPOLD:
Thank you.

2245
01:51:48,509 --> 01:51:49,908
Thank you, Uncle Millard.

2246
01:51:49,944 --> 01:51:51,002
Thank you.

2247
01:51:51,045 --> 01:51:52,876
I'm sorry, madam, but
this is a private affair.

2248
01:51:52,913 --> 01:51:54,141
No, you don't seem
to understand.

2249
01:51:54,215 --> 01:51:55,341
I need to get inside.

2250
01:51:55,382 --> 01:51:57,373
I need to get inside
right now and...

2251
01:51:57,418 --> 01:51:58,715
What seems to be the problem?

2252
01:51:58,752 --> 01:52:01,152
Are you Otis?

2253
01:52:01,222 --> 01:52:02,416
Well, let us proceed.

2254
01:52:02,456 --> 01:52:03,855
Please raise your glasses...

2255
01:52:05,826 --> 01:52:08,387
so we may toast
to my bride-to-be

2256
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:11,365
the woman whose
welfare and happiness

2257
01:52:11,399 --> 01:52:14,664
shall be my solemn duty
to maintain.

2258
01:52:14,703 --> 01:52:17,536
-Oh!
-The future Duchess of Albany...

2259
01:52:23,078 --> 01:52:24,636
Kate McKay.

2260
01:52:28,216 --> 01:52:31,744
Of the McKays of...?

2261
01:52:33,856 --> 01:52:35,619
Massapequa.

2262
01:52:35,658 --> 01:52:38,126
( people murmuring )

2263
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,957
LEOPOLD:
Massapequa.

2264
01:52:48,671 --> 01:52:49,831
I love you.

2265
01:52:49,872 --> 01:52:51,100
I love you.

2266
01:53:08,392 --> 01:53:12,089
( waltz playing )

2267
01:53:35,529 --> 01:53:39,192
# If I caught the world
in a bottle #

2268
01:53:39,233 --> 01:53:43,500
# And everything was still
beneath the moon #

2269
01:53:43,538 --> 01:53:50,000
# Without your love,
would it shine for me? #

2270
01:53:50,045 --> 01:53:53,572
# If I was smart as Aristotle #

2271
01:53:53,615 --> 01:53:58,450
# And understood
the rings around the moon #

2272
01:53:58,486 --> 01:54:03,981
# What would it all matter
if you loved me? #

2273
01:54:04,025 --> 01:54:09,623
# Here in your arms where
the world is impossibly still #

2274
01:54:09,665 --> 01:54:13,294
# With a million dreams
to fulfill #

2275
01:54:13,369 --> 01:54:18,432
# And a matter of moments
until the dancing ends #

2276
01:54:18,474 --> 01:54:24,071
# Here in your arms when
everything seems to be clear #

2277
01:54:24,113 --> 01:54:27,844
# Not a solitary thing
would I fear #

2278
01:54:27,884 --> 01:54:33,687
# Except when this moment comes
near the dancing's end #

2279
01:54:33,724 --> 01:54:37,455
# If I caught the world
in an hourglass #

2280
01:54:37,494 --> 01:54:41,794
# Saddled up the moon
so we could ride #

2281
01:54:41,832 --> 01:54:47,361
# Until the stars grew dim #

2282
01:54:47,404 --> 01:54:51,966
# Until... #

2283
01:54:52,009 --> 01:54:55,275
# One day
you'll meet a stranger #

2284
01:54:55,313 --> 01:55:00,273
# And all the noise
is silenced in the room #

2285
01:55:00,318 --> 01:55:05,915
# You'll feel that you're close
to some mystery #

2286
01:55:05,957 --> 01:55:09,757
# In the moonlight
and everything shatters #

2287
01:55:09,794 --> 01:55:14,458
# You feel as if you've
known her all your life #

2288
01:55:14,499 --> 01:55:20,234
# The world's oldest lesson
in history #

2289
01:55:20,272 --> 01:55:26,006
# Here in your arms where
the world is impossibly still #

2290
01:55:26,045 --> 01:55:29,640
# With a million dreams
to fulfill #

2291
01:55:29,682 --> 01:55:34,676
# And a matter of moments
until the dancing ends #

2292
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:40,455
# Here in your arms when
everything seems to be clear #

2293
01:55:40,493 --> 01:55:44,259
# Not a solitary thing
do I fear #

2294
01:55:44,364 --> 01:55:49,802
# Except when this moment
comes near the dancing's end #

2295
01:55:53,173 --> 01:55:57,234
# Oh, if I caught the world
in an hourglass #

2296
01:55:57,277 --> 01:56:01,737
# Saddled up the moon
and we would ride #

2297
01:56:01,781 --> 01:56:07,379
# Until the stars grew dim #

2298
01:56:07,421 --> 01:56:14,657
# Until the time
that time stands still #

2299
01:56:14,695 --> 01:56:21,100
# Until... #

2300
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:38,677
( drum rolls )

2301
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:42,850
( orchestral music plays )

2302
01:57:02,879 --> 01:57:05,871
# #

2303
01:57:25,903 --> 01:57:28,895
# #

2304
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:51,852
