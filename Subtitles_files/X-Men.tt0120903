00:00:24.65,00:00:27.88
Mutation--[br]it is the key to our evolution.

00:00:27.88,00:00:31.15
It has enabled us to evolve[br]from a single-celled organism...

00:00:31.15,00:00:33.69
into the dominant species[br]on the planet.

00:00:33.69,00:00:38.16
This process is slow and normally taking[br]thousands and thousands of years.

00:00:38.16,00:00:42.29
But every few hundred millennia,[br]evolution leaps forward.

00:04:26.38,00:04:29.38
Niagara Falls. Up...

00:04:29.38,00:04:34.72
the Canadian Rockies, and then it's[br]only a few hundred miles to Anchorage.

00:04:34.72,00:04:36.85
Well, won't it be[br]kind of cold ?

00:04:36.85,00:04:38.86
Well, that's[br]the point, stupid.

00:04:38.86,00:04:41.19
Otherwise, it wouldn't[br]be an adventure.

00:04:41.19,00:04:43.83
And when are you[br]gonna do this ?

00:04:47.70,00:04:49.80
- I don't know.

00:04:49.80,00:04:53.24
After high school.[br]Before college.

00:05:37.52,00:05:40.25
- Marie ! David ?[br]- I don't know what happened to him.

00:05:40.25,00:05:43.69
I don't know what--[br]I just touched him.

00:05:43.69,00:05:45.85
I didn't--[br]I didn't mean--

00:05:45.85,00:05:47.95
- Call an ambulance ![br]- Don't touch.

00:05:47.95,00:05:51.20
- Honey[br]-- - Just get away from me! - Call an ambulance !

00:05:51.20,00:05:53.37
Don't touch me !

00:05:53.37,00:05:54.17
- Don't touch me.[br]- Ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:54.17,00:05:56.61
- Don't touch me.[br]- Ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:56.61,00:05:59.61
we are now seeing the beginnings[br]of another stage of human evolution.

00:05:59.61,00:06:02.58
These mutations[br]manifest at puberty...

00:06:02.58,00:06:06.71
and are often triggered by periods[br]of heightened emotional stress.

00:06:06.71,00:06:09.48
Thank you, Ms. Grey.[br]It was quite educational.

00:06:09.48,00:06:14.12
However, it fails to address the issue[br]that is the focus of this hearing.

00:06:14.12,00:06:17.82
Three words:[br]Are mutants dangerous ?

00:06:17.82,00:06:20.80
I'm afraid that's[br]an unfair question, Senator Kelly.

00:06:20.80,00:06:23.73
After all, the wrong person behind[br]the wheel of a car can be dangerous.

00:06:23.73,00:06:25.79
Well, we do license[br]people to drive.

00:06:25.79,00:06:29.81
Yes, but not to live.[br]Senator, it is a fact...

00:06:29.81,00:06:33.33
that mutants who have come forward[br]and revealed themselves publicly...

00:06:33.33,00:06:37.11
have been met with fear,[br]hostility, even violence.

00:06:37.11,00:06:39.67
It is because of that[br]ever-present hostility...

00:06:39.67,00:06:43.31
that I am urging the Senate to vote[br]against mutant registration.

00:06:43.31,00:06:47.52
- To force mutants to expose themselves will only further[br]-- - Expose themselves ?

00:06:47.52,00:06:50.19
What is it the mutant community[br]has to hide I wonder...

00:06:50.19,00:06:52.35
that makes them so afraid[br]to identify themselves ?

00:06:52.35,00:06:56.26
- I didn't say they were hiding.[br]- Let me show you what is being hidden, Ms. Grey.

00:06:56.26,00:07:00.60
I have here a list of names[br]of identified mutants...

00:07:00.60,00:07:02.11
living right here[br]in the United States.

00:07:02.11,00:07:06.51
- Senator Kelly[br]-- - Now, here's a girl in Illinois who can walk through walls.

00:07:06.51,00:07:09.27
Now, what's to stop her[br]from walking into a bank vault...

00:07:09.27,00:07:12.47
or into the White House[br]or into their houses ?

00:07:12.47,00:07:14.78
- Senator Kelly--[br]- And there are even rumors, Ms. Grey,

00:07:14.78,00:07:19.92
of mutants so powerful that they can[br]enter our minds and control our thoughts,

00:07:19.92,00:07:22.79
taking our[br]God-given free will.

00:07:22.79,00:07:25.99
I think the American people[br]deserve the right to decide...

00:07:25.99,00:07:28.90
whether they want their children[br]to be in school with mutants,

00:07:28.90,00:07:30.83
to be taught by mutants.

00:07:32.77,00:07:35.47
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:35.47,00:07:38.67
the truth is[br]that mutants are very real,

00:07:38.67,00:07:41.68
and they are among us.

00:07:41.68,00:07:44.41
- We must know who they are,[br]- That's right!

00:07:44.41,00:07:46.42
and, above all,[br]we must know...

00:07:46.42,00:07:48.64
what they can do.

00:08:12.28,00:08:14.21
Eric.

00:08:16.78,00:08:20.18
- What are you doing here ?[br]- Why do you ask questions...

00:08:20.18,00:08:22.31
to which you already[br]know the answers ?

00:08:22.31,00:08:25.51
Don't give up[br]on them, Eric.

00:08:25.51,00:08:30.80
What would you have me do, Charles ?[br]I've heard these arguments before.

00:08:30.80,00:08:33.25
It was a long time ago.

00:08:33.25,00:08:35.56
Man kind has evolved[br]since then.

00:08:35.56,00:08:37.10
Yes,

00:08:37.10,00:08:39.26
into us.

00:08:45.58,00:08:47.51
You sneaking around[br]in here, Charles ?

00:08:47.51,00:08:50.17
What ever are you[br]looking for?

00:08:57.69,00:08:59.68
I'm looking for hope.

00:08:59.68,00:09:03.19
I will bring you hope,[br]old friend.

00:09:03.19,00:09:07.90
And I ask[br]only one thing in return.

00:09:09.30,00:09:10.97
Don't get in my way.

00:09:13.84,00:09:17.36
We are the future, Charles,[br]not them.

00:09:17.36,00:09:19.53
They no longer matter.

00:09:33.52,00:09:35.46
This is it.

00:09:42.97,00:09:44.90
Where are we ?

00:09:44.90,00:09:47.96
I thought you said you were gonna[br]take me as far as Laughlin City.

00:09:47.96,00:09:49.97
This is Laughlin City.

00:10:21.74,00:10:24.30
Gentlemen, in all my years,

00:10:24.30,00:10:26.54
I've never seen[br]anything like that.

00:10:28.68,00:10:32.74
Are you gonna let this man[br]walk away with your money ?

00:10:32.74,00:10:34.81
- I'll fight him !

00:10:38.86,00:10:43.69
Ladies and gentlemen,[br]our savior !

00:10:45.13,00:10:47.19
Whatever you do,[br]don't hit him in the balls.

00:10:47.19,00:10:51.22
- You said anything goes.[br]- Anything goes, but he'll take it personal.

00:11:16.60,00:11:20.00
- Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:20.00,00:11:24.20
tonight's winner[br]and still king of the cage,

00:11:24.20,00:11:26.70
the Wolverine!

00:11:54.46,00:11:56.56
You want[br]something new, honey ?

00:11:58.00,00:12:00.73
Or are you sticking[br]with water ?

00:12:09.61,00:12:11.55
I'll have a beer.

00:12:21.12,00:12:25.56
Ellis Island, once the arrival point[br]for thousands of American immigrants...

00:12:25.56,00:12:27.56
is opening[br]its doors again.

00:12:27.56,00:12:31.57
Preparations are nearly completed for[br]the upcoming United Nations world summit.

00:12:31.57,00:12:33.66
With nearly[br]every invitation confirmed,

00:12:33.66,00:12:38.90
the event promises to be the largest single[br]gathering of world leaders in history.

00:12:38.90,00:12:43.54
The leaders of over 200 nations will discuss[br]issues ranging from the world's economic climate...

00:12:43.54,00:12:48.28
and weapons treaties to the mutant[br]phenomenon and its impact on our world stage.

00:12:48.28,00:12:51.38
Many American legislators[br]have contended...

00:12:51.38,00:12:55.59
that debate over mutant issues should be the[br]primary focus of what is, on the surface,

00:12:55.59,00:12:58.65
a strictly[br]diplomatic affair.

00:12:58.65,00:13:01.70
- You owe me some money.[br]- Come on, Stu. Let's not do this.

00:13:01.70,00:13:06.20
No man takes a beating like that[br]without a mark to show for it.

00:13:06.20,00:13:08.86
Come on, buddy.[br]This isn't gonna be worth it.

00:13:08.86,00:13:11.97
- I know what you are.[br]- You lost your money. Keep this up, you'll lose something else.

00:13:11.97,00:13:13.63
Come on, buddy.

00:13:15.71,00:13:16.94
Look out !

00:13:30.36,00:13:32.62
Get out of my bar,[br]freak.

00:15:21.56,00:15:25.52
- What the hell are you doing ?[br]- I'm sorry. I needed a ride.

00:15:25.52,00:15:28.90
- Thought you might help me.[br]- Get out.

00:15:29.53,00:15:32.20
- Where am I supposed to go ?[br]- I don't know.

00:15:32.20,00:15:34.79
- You don't know or you don't care ?[br]- Pick one.

00:15:38.88,00:15:41.90
- I saved your life.[br]- No, you didn't.

00:15:57.16,00:15:59.63
You don't have anything[br]to eat, do you ?

00:16:20.82,00:16:22.75
I'm Rogue.

00:16:28.39,00:16:30.66
Were you in the army ?

00:16:30.66,00:16:33.16
Doesn't that mean[br]you were in the army ?

00:16:40.44,00:16:42.37
- Wow.[br]- What ?

00:16:46.18,00:16:49.10
- Suddenly my life doesn't look that bad.[br]- If you'd prefer the road--

00:16:49.10,00:16:52.52
No. No. It looks great.

00:16:55.49,00:16:58.32
Looks cozy.

00:17:04.69,00:17:07.30
Put your hands[br]on the heater.

00:17:08.20,00:17:10.56
I'm not gonna[br]hurt you, kid.

00:17:10.56,00:17:13.36
It's nothing personal.[br]It's just that...

00:17:13.36,00:17:15.56
when people touch my skin,[br]something happens.

00:17:15.56,00:17:19.37
- What ?[br]- I don't know.

00:17:19.37,00:17:21.81
They just get hurt.

00:17:21.81,00:17:23.81
Fair enough.

00:17:27.95,00:17:31.41
When they come out,[br]does it hurt ?

00:17:34.46,00:17:36.39
Every time.

00:17:39.50,00:17:42.26
So, what kind of a name[br]is Rogue ?

00:17:44.40,00:17:47.77
I don't know. What kind[br]of a name is Wolverine ?

00:17:51.84,00:17:53.78
My name's Logan.

00:17:55.78,00:17:56.50
Marie.

00:17:59.82,00:18:02.72
You know, you should wear[br]your seat belt.

00:18:02.72,00:18:04.95
Look, kid. I don't need advice[br]on auto safety from--

00:19:10.85,00:19:13.62
You all right ?

00:19:13.62,00:19:15.62
- Kid, are you all right ?[br]- I'm stuck !

00:21:01.51,00:21:06.50
- Weren't you supposed[br]to bring someone back with you ?

00:21:18.90,00:21:20.29
- What happened ?[br]- They knew.

00:21:29.13,00:21:30.90
Charles.

00:21:43.82,00:21:46.28
- Where is the mutant now ?[br]- With them.

00:21:49.50,00:21:51.61
I have made the first move.

00:21:52.79,00:21:55.56
That is all[br]they know.

00:21:55.56,00:21:58.50
Come. The U.N. summit[br]is approaching.

00:21:58.50,00:22:00.66
Time for[br]our little test.

00:23:11.37,00:23:13.30
Where's he going ?

00:23:40.30,00:23:42.86
Where are you going ?

00:23:48.64,00:23:50.57
Over here.

00:24:18.17,00:24:20.10
Where are you going ?[br] This way.

00:24:20.10,00:24:22.11
He's over there.

00:24:29.80,00:24:31.41
- Let's go.[br]- What's your hurry ?

00:24:55.64,00:24:58.67
Good morning, Logan.

00:24:58.67,00:25:01.54
I'd like your definitions of weak[br]and strong anthropic principles...

00:25:01.54,00:25:03.60
on my desk[br]on Wednesday.

00:25:03.60,00:25:05.62
That'll be all.

00:25:12.60,00:25:14.32
- Bye, Professor.[br]- Bye, Kitty.

00:25:18.23,00:25:20.16
Physics.

00:25:21.53,00:25:23.76
I'm Charles Xavier.[br]Would you like some breakfast ?

00:25:23.76,00:25:28.10
- Where am I ?[br]- Westchester, New York.

00:25:28.10,00:25:32.34
You were attacked. My people[br]brought you here for medical attention.

00:25:32.34,00:25:35.61
- I don't need medical attention.[br]- Yes, of course.

00:25:38.12,00:25:40.68
- Where's the girl ?[br]- Rogue ? She's here. She's fine.

00:25:40.68,00:25:41.52
Really.

00:25:43.52,00:25:49.39
Ah, Logan, I'd like you to meet[br]Ororo Monroe, also called Storm.

00:25:49.39,00:25:52.62
- This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops.[br]- Hello.

00:25:55.63,00:25:58.66
They saved your life.

00:25:58.66,00:26:01.47
I believe you've already[br]met Dr.Jean Grey.

00:26:03.40,00:26:05.67
You're in my school for the gifted.[br]For mutants.

00:26:05.67,00:26:09.24
- You'll be safe here from Magneto.[br]- What's a Magneto ?

00:26:09.24,00:26:12.98
A very powerful mutant[br]who believes that a war is brewing...

00:26:12.98,00:26:15.88
between mutants and[br]the rest of humanity.

00:26:15.88,00:26:17.89
I've been following[br]his activities for some time.

00:26:17.89,00:26:20.75
The man who attacked you is an associate[br]of his called Sabretooth.

00:26:20.75,00:26:22.82
Sabretooth ?

00:26:24.63,00:26:25.35
Storm.

00:26:27.63,00:26:30.26
What do they call you ?[br]Wheels ?

00:26:31.47,00:26:35.27
This is the stupidest[br]thing I've ever heard.

00:26:37.74,00:26:42.40
Cyclops, right ?[br]You wanna get out of my way ?

00:26:43.92,00:26:47.63
Logan, it's been almost[br]15 years, hasn't it ?

00:26:47.63,00:26:51.47
Living from day to day,[br]moving from place to place,

00:26:51.47,00:26:54.63
with no memory[br]of who or what you are.

00:26:54.63,00:26:56.64
Shut up.

00:26:56.64,00:26:58.74
Give me a chance.

00:26:58.74,00:27:02.25
I may be able to help you[br]find some answers.

00:27:02.25,00:27:04.68
How do you know ?

00:27:04.68,00:27:06.95
You're not the only one with gifts.

00:27:06.95,00:27:08.95
- Where are you going ?[br]- Where's he going ?

00:27:08.95,00:27:11.55
What are you doing there ?

00:27:15.66,00:27:17.29
What is this place ?

00:27:19.33,00:27:22.27
Anonymity is a mutant's first chance...

00:27:22.27,00:27:24.27
against[br]the world's hostility.

00:27:24.27,00:27:27.24
Hey, no powers !

00:27:27.24,00:27:30.14
To the public, we're merely[br]a school for gifted youngsters.

00:27:31.51,00:27:35.17
Cyclops, Storm and Jean[br]were some of my first students.

00:27:35.17,00:27:39.52
I protected them, taught them[br]to control their powers...

00:27:39.52,00:27:43.85
and in time,[br]teach others to do the same.

00:27:43.85,00:27:45.95
The students[br]are mostly run aways.

00:27:45.95,00:27:48.50
Frightened, alone.

00:27:48.50,00:27:50.76
Some with gifts so extreme[br]that they've become a danger...

00:27:50.76,00:27:53.10
to themselves[br]and those around them.

00:27:53.10,00:27:55.66
Like your friend, Rogue.

00:27:55.66,00:27:58.73
Incapable of physical human contact,[br]probably for the rest of her life,

00:27:58.73,00:28:02.50
and yet here she is[br]with others her own age,

00:28:02.50,00:28:06.30
learning being accepted,[br]not feared.

00:28:17.26,00:28:19.25
-John.[br]- Sorry.

00:28:24.53,00:28:26.97
I'm Bobby.[br]What's your name ?

00:28:26.97,00:28:30.49
- Rogue.[br]What'll happen to her?

00:28:30.49,00:28:34.51
Well, that's up to her. Rejoin the[br]world as an educated young woman...

00:28:34.51,00:28:36.51
or stay on[br]to teach others...

00:28:36.51,00:28:39.44
to become what the children[br]have affectionately called X-Men.

00:28:39.44,00:28:42.54
Welcome to Mutant High.

00:28:43.92,00:28:46.39
But the school is merely a public face.

00:28:46.39,00:28:50.45
The lower levels, however, are[br]an entirely different matter.

00:28:55.70,00:29:00.40
When I was a boy, I discovered I had[br]the power to control people's minds,

00:29:00.40,00:29:03.40
make them think or do[br]whatever I wanted.

00:29:03.40,00:29:07.63
When I was 17,[br]I met a young man named Eric Lensherr.

00:29:07.63,00:29:09.94
He, too, had[br]an unusual power.

00:29:09.94,00:29:14.40
He could create magnetic fields[br]and control metal.

00:29:14.40,00:29:16.28
Believing that humanity[br]would never accept us,

00:29:16.28,00:29:19.55
he grew angry and vengeful.

00:29:20.89,00:29:22.82
He became Magneto.

00:29:24.46,00:29:28.12
There are mutants out there[br]with incredible powers, Logan,

00:29:28.12,00:29:31.86
and many who do not share[br]my respect for man kind.

00:29:31.86,00:29:36.37
If no one is equipped to oppose them,[br]humanity's days could be over.

00:29:36.37,00:29:38.60
I'll make a deal[br]with you, Logan.

00:29:38.60,00:29:42.67
Give me 48 hours to find out[br]what Magneto wants with you,

00:29:42.67,00:29:45.91
and I give you my word[br]that I will use all my power...

00:29:45.91,00:29:48.68
to help you piece together[br]what you've lost...

00:29:48.68,00:29:49.18
and what[br]you're looking for.

00:29:49.18,00:29:51.21
and what[br]you're looking for.

00:30:19.50,00:30:22.11
Senator, listen,[br]you favor gun registration, yes ?

00:30:22.11,00:30:24.21
Well, some of these[br]so-called children...

00:30:24.21,00:30:28.81
possess more than ten times[br]the destructive force of any handgun.

00:30:28.81,00:30:32.62
No, I don't see a difference.[br]All I see are weapons in our schools.

00:30:32.62,00:30:35.56
Well, that's fair enough.[br]All right.

00:30:35.56,00:30:36.56
So ?

00:30:37.86,00:30:42.10
It's gonna be close.[br]A vote this loaded is always close.

00:30:42.10,00:30:45.40
What about the U.N. summit ?[br]The whole world will be watching.

00:30:45.40,00:30:47.96
Maybe there's some way[br]you could use that to your advantage.

00:30:47.96,00:30:49.98
We're Americans, Henry.

00:30:49.98,00:30:52.74
Let the rest of the damn world deal[br]with mutants in their own way.

00:30:52.74,00:30:55.25
You know this situation ?

00:30:55.25,00:30:57.81
These mutants ?

00:30:57.81,00:30:59.94
People like this Jean Grey ?

00:31:01.52,00:31:04.75
If it were up to me,[br]I'd lock 'em all away.

00:31:04.75,00:31:10.20
It's a war.[br]It's the reason people like me exist.

00:31:17.97,00:31:20.46
Where the hell are we ?

00:31:30.15,00:31:32.35
Pilot !

00:31:35.90,00:31:38.55
People like you are the reason[br]I was afraid to go to school as a child.

00:32:11.22,00:32:14.85
- I'm sorry.[br]- For what ?

00:32:14.85,00:32:17.19
If I hurt you.

00:32:26.61,00:32:30.67
So, couldn't wait to get[br]my shirt off again, huh ?

00:32:47.56,00:32:50.18
The metal is an alloy called adamantium.

00:32:50.18,00:32:55.99
Supposedly indestructible. It's been[br]surgically grafted to his entire skeleton.

00:32:55.99,00:32:59.43
How could he have survived[br]a procedure like that ?

00:32:59.43,00:33:03.40
His mutation. He has uncharted[br]regenerative capability,

00:33:03.40,00:33:06.37
which enables him[br]to heal rapidly.

00:33:06.37,00:33:10.28
This also makes his age[br]impossible to determine.

00:33:10.28,00:33:12.97
He could very well[br]be older than you, Professor.

00:33:14.32,00:33:17.15
- Who did this to him ?[br]- He doesn't know.

00:33:17.15,00:33:20.78
Nor does he remember anything[br]about his life before it happened.

00:33:20.78,00:33:23.48
Experimentation[br]on mutants.

00:33:23.48,00:33:25.62
It's not unheard of.

00:33:25.62,00:33:28.93
But I've never seen[br]anything like this before.

00:33:28.93,00:33:31.93
What do you think[br]Magneto wants with him ?

00:33:31.93,00:33:35.81
I'm not entirely sure[br]it's him Magneto wants.

00:33:57.53,00:33:58.25
Yech !

00:33:59.53,00:34:02.90
Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator.

00:34:02.90,00:34:04.60
Just like you.

00:34:11.78,00:34:14.14
Who are you people ?[br]Where's Henry ?

00:34:14.14,00:34:17.81
Mr. Guyrich has been dead[br]for some time, Senator.

00:34:17.81,00:34:20.72
But I've had Mystique here[br]keep you company.

00:34:20.72,00:34:22.72
She takes[br]so many shapes.

00:34:22.72,00:34:26.38
Whatever you do to me,[br]you'll make me right.

00:34:26.38,00:34:30.33
Every word I've spoken[br]will be confirmed.

00:34:33.27,00:34:35.63
Are you a God-fearing[br]man, Senator ?

00:34:35.63,00:34:38.73
That's such[br]a strange phrase.

00:34:38.73,00:34:41.57
I've always thought[br]of God as a teacher,

00:34:41.57,00:34:45.13
as a bringer of light,[br]wisdom and understanding.

00:34:45.13,00:34:50.95
You see, I think[br]what you really are afraid of is me.

00:34:50.95,00:34:54.15
Me and my kind.[br]The Brotherhood of Mutants.

00:34:56.59,00:34:59.20
Though it's not[br]so surprising, really.

00:34:59.20,00:35:03.62
Man kind has always feared[br]what it doesn't understand.

00:35:05.26,00:35:08.29
Well, don't fear God,[br]Senator,

00:35:08.29,00:35:10.30
and certainly,[br]don't fear me.

00:35:11.44,00:35:13.37
Not anymore.

00:35:15.51,00:35:17.50
What do you intend[br]to do to me ?

00:35:17.50,00:35:21.10
Let's just say[br]God works too slowly.

00:36:36.59,00:36:38.85
I think you'll[br]be comfortable here.

00:36:38.85,00:36:42.12
- Where is your room ?[br]- With Scott down the hall.

00:36:43.60,00:36:46.96
Is that your gift ?[br]Putting up with that guy ?

00:36:46.96,00:36:50.70
Actually, I'm telekinetic.[br]I can move things with my mind.

00:36:50.70,00:36:52.90
Really ?[br]What kinds of things ?

00:36:54.47,00:36:57.27
All kinds of things.

00:36:57.27,00:37:00.14
I also have some[br]telepathic ability.

00:37:00.14,00:37:03.65
- What, like your Professor ?[br]- Nowhere near that powerful.

00:37:03.65,00:37:06.55
But he's teaching me[br]to develop it.

00:37:06.55,00:37:08.55
I'm sure he is.

00:37:10.62,00:37:12.89
- So read my mind.[br]- I'd rather not.

00:37:12.89,00:37:15.45
Come on.[br]You afraid you might like it ?

00:37:15.45,00:37:17.43
I doubt it.

00:37:38.48,00:37:40.80
What do you see ?

00:37:41.72,00:37:42.44
Scott.

00:37:46.93,00:37:49.19
Good night, Logan.

00:37:58.10,00:38:00.40
You gonna tell me[br]to stay away from your girl ?

00:38:00.40,00:38:02.37
If I had to do that,[br]she wouldn't be my girl.

00:38:02.37,00:38:06.40
Hmm. Well, then, I guess[br]you've got nothing to worry about,

00:38:06.40,00:38:08.50
do you, Cyclops ?

00:38:08.50,00:38:12.48
Yeah, it must just burn you up that[br]a boy like me saved your life, huh ?

00:38:12.48,00:38:15.40
You ought to be careful.[br]I might not be there next time.

00:38:15.40,00:38:18.22
Oh, and, Logan,

00:38:18.22,00:38:19.29
stay away from my girl.

00:38:19.29,00:38:20.88
stay away from my girl.

00:38:54.26,00:38:54.98
Logan.

00:39:05.67,00:39:08.83
Logan. Logan, wake up.

00:39:40.87,00:39:42.70
- Help me.

00:39:47.10,00:39:49.98
Somebody help !

00:40:20.69,00:40:22.92
Scott, grab a pillow.

00:40:25.16,00:40:27.89
It was an accident.

00:40:36.84,00:40:40.14
- Logan ?[br]- What happened ?

00:40:41.48,00:40:44.70
- Is she all right ?[br]- She'll be all right.

00:40:46.25,00:40:48.18
What did she do to me ?

00:40:48.18,00:40:52.80
Whenever Rogue touches someone, she[br]takes their energy, their life force.

00:40:52.80,00:40:56.90
In the case of mutants, she absorbs[br]their gifts for a short while.

00:40:56.90,00:40:58.65
In your case,[br]your ability to heal.

00:41:01.30,00:41:03.20
I feel like[br]she almost killed me.

00:41:03.20,00:41:06.26
If she'd held out any longer,[br]she could have.

00:42:01.79,00:42:04.99
How are we feeling, Senator ?[br]Advanced, I hope.

00:42:06.89,00:42:07.89
Hmm.

00:42:22.61,00:42:25.40
What the hell[br]have you done to me ?

00:42:25.40,00:42:29.14
Senator, this is pointless.[br]Where would you go ?

00:42:29.14,00:42:31.84
Who would take you in[br]now that you're one of us ?

00:43:28.51,00:43:32.95
Tommy, let it go![br]Tommy, please let it go!

00:43:32.95,00:43:34.95
I'm telling Mommy.

00:43:49.36,00:43:52.20
Is that a mutant ?

00:43:57.14,00:43:59.70
...of this week's U.N. summit.

00:43:59.70,00:44:01.61
With the leaders[br]of over 200 nations attending,

00:44:01.61,00:44:04.64
the secret service[br]has transformed Ellis Island...

00:44:04.64,00:44:08.15
into a veritable Fort Knox[br]for tomorrow night's opening gala.

00:44:08.15,00:44:11.91
Ellis Island rests less than one mile[br]from the shores of Manhattan.

00:44:13.42,00:44:14.14
Rogue.

00:44:15.42,00:44:19.29
- Bobby.[br]- Rogue, what did you do ?

00:44:20.66,00:44:22.72
They say that you're[br]stealing other mutants' powers.

00:44:22.72,00:44:24.79
No, no.[br]I borrowed his powers.

00:44:24.79,00:44:28.16
You never use your power[br]against another mutant.

00:44:30.24,00:44:32.70
I had no choice.

00:44:32.70,00:44:34.87
- No, you have to understand me.[br]- If I were you,

00:44:34.87,00:44:37.38
I'd get myself out of here.

00:44:39.78,00:44:43.68
- What do you mean ?[br]- Listen, the students are freaked.

00:44:43.68,00:44:46.72
Professor Xavier's furious.[br]I don't know what he'll do with you.

00:44:50.32,00:44:52.99
I think it'll be easier[br]on your own.

00:44:58.97,00:45:01.20
You should go.

00:45:24.46,00:45:26.43
What are you looking for, Eric ?

00:45:26.43,00:45:31.36
It's strange. There are[br]more powerful mutants out there.

00:45:31.36,00:45:33.63
Why should this one[br]be so important to him ?

00:45:33.63,00:45:36.70
- Maybe it's his way with people.[br]- You don't like him.

00:45:37.50,00:45:41.10
- How could you tell ?[br]- Well, I am psychic, you know.

00:45:42.51,00:45:44.44
- Where is she ?[br]- Who ?

00:45:44.44,00:45:45.16
Rogue.

00:45:46.51,00:45:48.54
She's gone.

00:45:53.20,00:45:55.61
Welcome, Professor.

00:45:58.46,00:46:00.72
Welcome to Cerebro.

00:46:05.30,00:46:08.93
This certainly is[br]a big, round room.

00:46:08.93,00:46:12.60
The brain waves of mutants[br]are different from average human beings.

00:46:12.60,00:46:14.61
This device amplifiies[br]my power,

00:46:14.61,00:46:17.44
allowing me to locate mutants[br]across great distances.

00:46:17.44,00:46:20.45
That's how I intend[br]to find Rogue.

00:46:20.45,00:46:23.48
- Why don't you just use it to find Magneto ?[br]- I've been trying.

00:46:23.48,00:46:27.28
But he seems to have found[br]some way to shield himself from it.

00:46:27.28,00:46:30.55
How would he know[br]how to do that ?

00:46:30.55,00:46:33.68
Because he[br]helped me build it.

00:46:33.68,00:46:36.29
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:46:48.41,00:46:50.81
Have you ever--

00:46:50.81,00:46:53.11
Used Cerebro ?

00:46:53.11,00:46:56.71
No. It takes[br]a degree of control,

00:46:56.71,00:47:00.45
and, uh,[br]for someone like me, it's--

00:47:00.45,00:47:02.42
Dangerous.

00:47:39.92,00:47:43.12
...now boarding on track four.

00:47:46.80,00:47:49.46
- She's at the train station.[br]- Where is it ?

00:47:49.46,00:47:52.83
A few miles west of here.[br]Logan, you can't leave the mansion.

00:47:52.83,00:47:57.17
- It's just the opportunity Magneto needs.[br]- I'm the reason she took off.

00:47:57.17,00:48:01.41
- We had a deal.[br]- She's all right. She's just upset.

00:48:01.41,00:48:03.74
Storm, Cyclops, find her.[br]See if you can talk to her.

00:48:13.96,00:48:17.39
- What ?[br]- Where's my motorcycle ?

00:48:54.13,00:48:56.29
Hey, kid.

00:49:11.10,00:49:12.95
I'm sorry[br]about last night.

00:49:14.45,00:49:16.39
Me too.

00:49:18.32,00:49:23.73
- You running again ?[br]- I heard the professor was mad at me.

00:49:23.73,00:49:27.99
- Well, who told you that ?[br]- A boy at school.

00:49:27.99,00:49:31.47
- When's the last time you saw her ?[br]- She was supposed to meet me for lunch.

00:49:37.21,00:49:40.18
You look around.[br]I'll check with the ticket agent.

00:49:53.66,00:49:55.59
Welcome, Professor.

00:50:20.55,00:50:24.82
- You think I should go back.[br]- No, I think you should follow your instincts.

00:50:30.76,00:50:33.39
The first boy I ever kissed...

00:50:33.39,00:50:36.99
ended up in a coma[br]for three weeks.

00:50:39.24,00:50:41.80
I can still feel him[br]inside my head.

00:50:44.21,00:50:46.54
And it's the same[br]with you.

00:51:13.20,00:51:17.57
There's not many people that'll[br]understand what you're going through,

00:51:17.57,00:51:21.84
but I think this guy's[br]Xavier's one of them.

00:51:21.84,00:51:25.21
He seems to genuinely[br]wanna help you,

00:51:25.21,00:51:27.58
and that's[br]a rare thing...

00:51:29.15,00:51:31.42
for people like us.

00:51:42.57,00:51:45.23
So, what do you say ?

00:51:45.23,00:51:48.57
Give these geeks[br]one more shot ?

00:51:50.14,00:51:52.70
Come on.[br]I'll take care of you.

00:51:54.71,00:51:57.70
- You promise ?[br]- Yeah.

00:51:57.70,00:51:59.72
Yeah, I promise.

00:52:13.00,00:52:14.93
Come along now.

00:52:16.83,00:52:20.23
She's about 17.[br]Uh, my height.

00:52:20.23,00:52:23.47
Has brown hair,[br]and she--

00:52:29.81,00:52:32.84
Scream for me.

00:53:17.88,00:53:20.72
- Quit playing around.

00:54:02.23,00:54:04.49
You must be Wolverine.

00:54:06.27,00:54:09.89
That remarkable metal doesn't run[br]through your entire body, does it ?

00:54:22.42,00:54:25.44
Stop ! Stop it !

00:54:25.44,00:54:28.42
What the hell[br]do you want with me ?

00:54:28.42,00:54:32.72
You ? My dear boy,[br]who ever said I wanted you ?

00:54:54.31,00:54:56.25
Young people.

00:55:07.96,00:55:10.16
All right, hold it.[br]Hold it right there.

00:55:10.16,00:55:13.29
Stay where you are.[br]Put your hands over your heads now.

00:55:45.87,00:55:49.32
You Homo sapiens[br]and your guns.

00:55:53.17,00:55:55.64
- That's enough, Eric.[br]- Let them go.

00:56:01.11,00:56:04.24
Why not come out where[br]I can see you, Charles ?

00:56:07.39,00:56:09.32
- What do you--[br]- Want her for ?

00:56:10.36,00:56:13.29
Can't you read my mind ?

00:56:14.79,00:56:18.46
What now ?[br]Save the girl ?

00:56:18.46,00:56:23.60
You'll have to kill me, Charles.[br]And what will that accomplish ?

00:56:23.60,00:56:27.40
Let them pass that law. They'll have you in[br]chains with a number burned into your forehead.

00:56:27.40,00:56:29.30
- It won't be--[br]- That way.

00:56:29.30,00:56:31.54
Then kill me[br]and find out.

00:56:34.25,00:56:37.31
Huh ? Then release me.

00:56:45.56,00:56:47.49
Fine.

00:57:00.47,00:57:02.84
Care to press your luck,[br]Charles ?

00:57:07.41,00:57:11.80
- I don't think I can stop them all.

00:57:25.46,00:57:27.46
Still unwilling[br]to make sacrifices.

00:57:27.46,00:57:30.63
That's what[br]makes you weak.

00:57:42.38,00:57:44.94
Good-bye, Charles.

00:58:14.96,00:58:18.41
- You said he wanted me.[br]- I made a terrible mistake.

00:58:18.41,00:58:21.99
His helmet was somehow designed[br]to block my telepathy.

00:58:23.57,00:58:26.93
I couldn't see what[br]he was after till it was too late.

00:58:26.93,00:58:29.13
- Where are you going ?[br]- I'm gonna find her.

00:58:29.13,00:58:32.33
- How ?[br]- The traditional way. Look.

00:58:35.68,00:58:38.17
Logan, you can't[br]do this alone.

00:58:38.17,00:58:41.24
Who's gonna help me ? You ?[br]So far you've all done a bang-up job.

00:58:41.24,00:58:43.58
Then help us.[br]Fight with us.

00:58:43.58,00:58:46.38
Fight with you ?[br]What, join the team ? Be an X-Man ?

00:58:46.38,00:58:49.22
Who the hell do you think you are ?[br]You're a mutant.

00:58:49.22,00:58:52.35
The whole world out there is full[br]of people that hate and fear you.

00:58:52.35,00:58:56.16
And you're wasting your time trying to[br]protect 'em ? I got better things to do.

00:58:56.16,00:59:00.69
You know, Magneto's right.[br]There's a war coming.

00:59:00.69,00:59:05.00
- You sure you're on the right side ?[br]- At least I've chosen a side.

00:59:12.75,00:59:16.38
I'm looking[br]for Dr.Jean Grey.

00:59:25.30,00:59:27.46
Senator Kelly.

00:59:27.46,00:59:29.90
I'm Professor[br]Charles Xavier.

00:59:31.80,00:59:35.96
I was afraid if I went[br]to a hospital, they would--

00:59:35.96,00:59:38.60
Treat you like a mutant ?

00:59:40.14,00:59:44.80
We're not what you think.[br]Not all of us.

00:59:44.80,00:59:47.98
Tell it to the ones[br]who did this to me.

00:59:52.42,00:59:54.35
Senator...

00:59:59.60,01:00:02.52
I want you to try and relax.

01:00:05.50,01:00:07.43
I'm not going[br]to hurt you.

01:00:59.69,01:01:02.78
Welcome to the future,

01:01:02.78,01:01:04.79
brother.

01:01:10.90,01:01:15.60
The machine emits radiation that triggers[br]mutation in ordinary human beings.

01:01:15.60,01:01:17.23
But the mutation[br]is unnatural.

01:01:17.23,01:01:19.93
Kelly's body is rejecting it.[br]His cells began...

01:01:19.93,01:01:22.34
to break down[br]almost immediately.

01:01:22.34,01:01:25.31
- What effect does radiation have on mutants ?[br]- There appears to be none.

01:01:25.31,01:01:29.21
But I fear it will seriously[br]harm any normal person exposed to it.

01:01:29.21,01:01:33.19
- So what does Magneto want with Rogue ?[br]- I don't know.

01:01:35.36,01:01:37.82
Wait a second.

01:01:37.82,01:01:40.66
You said this machine[br]draws its power from Magneto...

01:01:40.66,01:01:43.53
-and that it weakened him.[br]- Yes.

01:01:44.83,01:01:46.93
In fact,[br]it nearly killed him.

01:01:46.93,01:01:49.66
He's gonna transfer[br]his power to Rogue...

01:01:49.66,01:01:52.93
and use her[br]to power the machine.

01:01:55.58,01:01:57.74
Is somebody there ?

01:01:59.58,01:02:02.57
Yes. I'm here.

01:02:04.52,01:02:07.51
Please don't leave me.

01:02:08.72,01:02:11.12
Don't want to be alone.

01:02:12.76,01:02:14.69
All right.

01:02:23.64,01:02:26.73
Do you hate[br]normal people ?

01:02:28.94,01:02:31.61
Sometimes.

01:02:31.61,01:02:33.61
Why ?

01:02:37.39,01:02:39.32
I suppose...

01:02:40.82,01:02:43.15
I'm afraid of them.

01:02:45.90,01:02:46.34
Well,

01:02:47.53,01:02:51.43
I think you've got[br]one less person to--

01:02:51.43,01:02:53.43
to be afraid of.

01:03:16.52,01:03:19.29
Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet.[br]I'm gonna find Rogue.

01:03:19.29,01:03:22.49
-Jean, get Logan a uniform.[br]- Whoa, wait a minute.

01:03:22.49,01:03:25.56
- He's not coming with us, is he ?[br]- Yes.

01:03:25.56,01:03:28.33
I'm sorry, Professor, but he'll[br]endanger the mission. And if--

01:03:28.33,01:03:31.60
Hey, I wasn't the one who gave[br]the train station a new sunroof, pal.

01:03:31.60,01:03:33.97
- No, you were the one who stabbed Rogue through the chest.[br]- Scott--

01:03:33.97,01:03:37.44
Hey, why don't you take your[br]little mission and stick it up your--

01:03:37.44,01:03:39.78
Senator Kelly is dead.

01:03:41.65,01:03:43.64
I'm going to find her.

01:03:45.32,01:03:47.62
Settle this.

01:04:25.33,01:04:27.26
I'm sorry.

01:04:50.92,01:04:54.68
You can still hear me, can't you ?

01:05:02.26,01:05:07.57
You've taught me everything in my life[br]that was ever worth knowing.

01:05:07.57,01:05:09.22
And if anything happens,

01:05:09.22,01:05:10.95
And if anything happens,

01:05:10.95,01:05:14.25
well, I'll take care[br]of them.

01:05:27.74,01:05:28.46
Jean ?

01:05:33.40,01:05:33.76
Jean !

01:05:35.55,01:05:36.55
No !

01:05:50.66,01:05:51.38
Jean ?

01:05:52.66,01:05:54.60
Jean.

01:05:54.60,01:05:57.30
Answer me. Please.

01:05:58.27,01:06:00.29
I know[br]where Magneto's going.

01:07:20.50,01:07:22.25
Magnificent, isn't she ?

01:07:23.52,01:07:28.22
- I've seen it.[br]- I first saw her in 1949.

01:07:28.22,01:07:31.79
America was gonna be[br]the land of tolerance,

01:07:31.79,01:07:33.80
of peace.

01:07:38.24,01:07:40.40
Are you going[br]to kill me ?

01:07:45.74,01:07:48.58
- Yes.[br]- Why ?

01:07:48.58,01:07:52.95
Because there is no land of tolerance.[br]There is no peace.

01:07:52.95,01:07:55.78
Not here[br]or anywhere else.

01:07:55.78,01:07:59.69
Women and children,[br]whole families destroyed...

01:07:59.69,01:08:02.59
simply because they were born different[br]from those in power.

01:08:02.59,01:08:07.50
Well, after tonight, the world's[br]powerful will be just like us.

01:08:07.50,01:08:10.63
They will return home[br]as brothers.

01:08:10.63,01:08:13.17
As mutants.

01:08:13.17,01:08:15.76
Our cause will be theirs.

01:08:15.76,01:08:19.97
Your sacrifice[br]will mean our survival.

01:08:23.72,01:08:27.80
I'll understand if that[br]comes as small consolation.

01:08:30.59,01:08:32.78
Put her in the machine.

01:08:34.60,01:08:35.99
I'll raise it.

01:08:37.76,01:08:40.86
Magneto is here. Liberty Island.

01:08:40.86,01:08:44.33
Now, presumably, his objective is to mutate[br]the world leaders at the U.N. summit...

01:08:44.33,01:08:46.46
on Ellis Island.

01:08:46.46,01:08:48.70
He doesn't know[br]his machine kills.

01:08:48.70,01:08:52.37
And judging from what the Professor saw,[br]if Magneto gave Rogue enough power--

01:08:52.37,01:08:56.68
He could wipe out everyone[br]in New York City.

01:08:56.68,01:08:59.91
We can insert here[br]at the George Washington Bridge,

01:08:59.91,01:09:02.35
come around the bank[br]just off of Manhattan.

01:09:02.35,01:09:05.98
We land on the far side[br]of Liberty Island here.

01:09:05.98,01:09:08.30
What about harbor patrol ?[br]Radar ?

01:09:08.30,01:09:11.99
If they have anything that can pick up[br]our jet, they deserve to catch us.

01:09:26.48,01:09:29.50
You actually go outside[br]in these things ?

01:09:29.50,01:09:31.95
Well, what would you prefer,[br]yellow spandex ?

01:09:38.26,01:09:39.22
- Whoa !

01:10:22.97,01:10:25.96
Okay, there's the bridge.[br]I'm taking her down.

01:10:32.38,01:10:34.94
Storm, some cover,[br]please.

01:10:53.56,01:10:57.23
Toad, Mystique, stay sharp.[br]We're not alone.

01:10:57.23,01:10:59.24
And you stay here.

01:10:59.24,01:11:03.70
Once I give my power to the girl,[br]I'll be temporarily weakened.

01:11:03.70,01:11:05.17
You'll be[br]my only defense.

01:11:12.75,01:11:14.68
Sounds like[br]a storm's coming.

01:11:29.70,01:11:32.56
- Sorry.[br]- You call that a landing ?

01:11:44.32,01:11:46.25
The torch.

01:11:54.29,01:11:56.56
...within a mile of the proceedings.

01:11:56.56,01:11:59.39
The first dignitaries[br]started to arrive about an hour ago,

01:11:59.39,01:12:01.83
greeted with a sort[br]of garden-party atmosphere,

01:12:01.83,01:12:03.83
which was designed[br]to entertain them,

01:12:03.83,01:12:06.87
-as the others[br]traversed the rigid security.

01:12:31.23,01:12:34.99
- There's someone here.[br]- Where ?

01:12:34.99,01:12:38.43
- I don't know. Keep your eye open.[br]- Logan.

01:12:41.50,01:12:44.00
Damn it.

01:12:49.88,01:12:52.71
- Anything ?[br]- I know there's someone here. I just can't see 'em.

01:13:06.96,01:13:08.93
- Wait ![br]- Wait !

01:13:15.37,01:13:17.60
All right, back up.[br]Back up.

01:14:32.62,01:14:34.61
-Jean !

01:14:35.95,01:14:38.50
Oh, God.

01:15:38.58,01:15:40.78
Don't move.

01:15:56.93,01:15:58.86
Don't you people ever die ?

01:16:33.30,01:16:36.60
Do you know what happens to a toad[br]when it's struck by lightning ?

01:16:43.40,01:16:45.48
Same thing that happens[br]to everything else.

01:17:01.12,01:17:03.50
Logan, is that you ?

01:17:03.50,01:17:04.50
Shh.

01:17:14.86,01:17:17.99
The other one[br]ain't far away.

01:17:17.99,01:17:20.59
Come on.[br]We have to regroup.

01:17:20.59,01:17:22.60
I know,[br]but there's a problem.

01:17:25.21,01:17:28.70
You're not part of the group.

01:17:48.70,01:17:50.69
Hey, hey, it's me.

01:17:50.69,01:17:54.17
- Prove it.[br]- You're a dick.

01:17:55.37,01:17:57.30
Okay.

01:17:59.10,01:18:00.10
Hey.

01:18:18.46,01:18:20.83
Everybody get out of here.

01:18:20.83,01:18:23.92
- What is it ?[br]- I can't move.

01:18:44.45,01:18:47.15
Ah, my brothers.

01:18:47.15,01:18:50.32
Welcome. And, you,

01:18:50.32,01:18:53.38
just point those claws of yours[br]in a safer direction.

01:19:07.48,01:19:09.50
You'd better close[br]your eyes.

01:19:12.61,01:19:14.91
-Storm, fry him.[br]- Oh, yes.

01:19:14.91,01:19:19.89
A bolt of lightning into[br]a huge copper conductor.

01:19:19.89,01:19:21.95
I thought you lived[br]at a school.

01:19:27.30,01:19:30.59
For those of you who may not be familiar[br]with the historical significance--

01:19:35.84,01:19:38.60
Mystique ?

01:19:38.60,01:19:40.77
- Mystique ?[br]- I've seen Senator Kelly.

01:19:42.61,01:19:46.31
So the good senator[br]survived his fall...

01:19:46.31,01:19:48.78
and the swim to shore.

01:19:48.78,01:19:51.80
He's become even more powerful[br]than I could have imagined.

01:19:51.80,01:19:53.85
- He's dead.[br]- It's true.

01:19:53.85,01:19:58.45
I saw him die.[br]Like those people down there will die.

01:19:58.45,01:20:02.16
Are you sure[br]you saw what you saw ?

01:20:02.16,01:20:06.60
I would also like to thank[br]the president of the United States...

01:20:06.60,01:20:08.93
for hosting this event...

01:20:08.93,01:20:12.41
under the lights of[br]the great city of New York.

01:20:19.75,01:20:23.51
Why do none of you understand[br]what I'm trying to do ?

01:20:23.51,01:20:29.35
Those people down there, they control our[br]fate and the fate of every other mutant.

01:20:30.76,01:20:32.10
Well,

01:20:33.90,01:20:35.76
soon our fate[br]will be theirs.

01:20:35.76,01:20:39.10
Help ! Please help me!

01:20:39.10,01:20:41.10
You're so full of shit.

01:20:41.10,01:20:45.37
If you were really so righteous,[br]it'd be you in that thing.

01:20:47.24,01:20:51.40
Help ![br]Somebody help me!

01:21:03.79,01:21:05.73
Please!

01:21:05.73,01:21:10.82
-Somebody please help me!

01:21:14.74,01:21:17.70
-Somebody!

01:21:17.70,01:21:17.79
Help--

01:21:27.22,01:21:28.30
- Logan !

01:22:27.59,01:22:30.96
- I'm sorry, my dear.[br]- Don't do this.

01:22:43.37,01:22:45.47
This is mine.

01:23:48.37,01:23:50.50
You owe me a scream.

01:23:53.81,01:23:56.54
Hey, bub. I'm not[br]finished with you yet.

01:23:59.62,01:24:00.34
-Jean.

01:24:02.35,01:24:04.79
- Scott, when I tell you, open your eyes.[br]- No.

01:24:04.79,01:24:07.35
- Trust me.[br]- You drop something ?

01:24:11.90,01:24:12.90
Now.

01:24:28.50,01:24:30.24
- Thanks.[br]- Don't mention it.

01:24:30.24,01:24:34.34
We gotta get her out of there.[br]Cyclops, can you hit it ?

01:24:34.34,01:24:37.58
- The rings are too fast.[br]I'll kill her. -Just shoot it.

01:24:37.58,01:24:39.99
- Storm, can you get me up there ?[br]- I can't control it like that.

01:24:39.99,01:24:42.92
- You could fly right over the torch.[br]- Then let me go.

01:24:42.92,01:24:47.36
If I don't make it, then at least[br]you can still blast the damn thing.

01:24:48.60,01:24:50.86
All right, do it.

01:24:50.86,01:24:53.40
Jean, use your power.[br]Try to steady him.

01:24:54.81,01:24:57.70
Hang on to something.

01:25:50.83,01:25:52.92
Scott, wait.

01:26:23.56,01:26:25.96
- I have to.[br]-Just wait.

01:26:27.83,01:26:30.43
I have a shot.

01:26:30.43,01:26:32.37
I'm taking it.

01:27:12.27,01:27:14.20
Come on.

01:28:45.16,01:28:47.92
Hey, this one's alive.[br]Let's get him out of here.

01:29:14.20,01:29:15.95
Welcome back.

01:29:15.95,01:29:19.80
I knew you'd find[br]your way.

01:29:19.80,01:29:21.25
I had you to guide me.

01:29:23.50,01:29:25.56
How did we do ?

01:29:53.30,01:29:55.76
Oh ![br]Oh, that tickles.

01:29:56.93,01:29:57.93
Hey.

01:30:00.33,01:30:01.33
Hey.

01:30:02.34,01:30:05.60
- How're you feeling ?[br]- Fantastic.

01:30:07.67,01:30:10.40
That was[br]a brave thing you did.

01:30:11.44,01:30:15.40
- Did it work ?[br]- Yeah. She's fine.

01:30:16.72,01:30:19.95
She took on a few of your more[br]charming personality traits for a while.

01:30:19.95,01:30:23.61
- But we lived through it.

01:30:27.90,01:30:30.30
I think she's[br]a little taken with you.

01:30:30.30,01:30:34.50
Well, you can tell her[br]my heart belongs to someone else.

01:30:38.90,01:30:42.74
- You know, you and I--[br]- How's the professor ?

01:30:45.54,01:30:48.51
- He's good.[br]- Good.

01:30:54.72,01:30:58.99
There's an abandoned military compound[br]at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies,

01:30:58.99,01:31:00.99
close to where[br]we found you.

01:31:00.99,01:31:05.43
There's not much left,[br]but you might find some answers.

01:31:07.93,01:31:11.14
- Thank you.[br]- Are you going to say good-bye to them ?

01:31:13.94,01:31:18.30
The Mutant Registration[br]Act lost its main proponent today...

01:31:18.30,01:31:20.84
with the dramatic reversal[br]of Senator Robert Kelly,

01:31:20.84,01:31:25.37
who until this time had provided the loudest[br]voice in the cry for mutant registration.

01:31:25.37,01:31:27.44
I was wrong[br]on this particular issue.

01:31:27.44,01:31:30.89
And I hope in time I may be forgiven.[br]Thank you.

01:31:30.89,01:31:35.59
- The Mutant Registration Act[br]continues to draw support... -Mystique.

01:31:37.93,01:31:41.23
Son of a bitch.

01:31:41.23,01:31:43.27
from many[br]Parents Rights groups...

01:31:43.27,01:31:47.70
who feel threatened by unidentified[br]mutants in their school systems.

01:31:47.70,01:31:49.77
In a related story,

01:31:49.77,01:31:54.28
the body of Senator Kelly's longtime[br]aide, Henry Guyrich, was found today.

01:31:54.28,01:31:59.61
Preliminary coroner reports seem to[br]indicate that Guyrich was mauled by a bear.

01:31:59.61,01:32:01.41
Hey.

01:32:05.86,01:32:09.32
- You running again ?[br]- No, not really.

01:32:11.00,01:32:14.12
I have some things[br]to take care of up north.

01:32:19.60,01:32:21.77
I kind of like it.

01:32:24.94,01:32:28.40
- I don't want you to go.

01:32:40.93,01:32:42.92
I'll be back for this.

01:33:22.30,01:33:24.56
Doesn't it ever wake you[br]in the middle of the night ?

01:33:24.56,01:33:27.50
The feeling that someday[br]they will pass that foolish law...

01:33:27.50,01:33:31.91
or one just like it[br]and come for you...

01:33:31.91,01:33:34.84
and your children ?

01:33:37.80,01:33:39.35
It does, indeed.

01:33:44.66,01:33:47.68
What do you do when[br]you wake up to that ?

01:33:47.68,01:33:50.92
I feel a great swell of pity[br]for the poor soul...

01:33:50.92,01:33:54.66
who comes to that school[br]looking for trouble.

01:34:02.74,01:34:05.37
Why do you come here,[br]Charles ?

01:34:05.37,01:34:08.44
Why do you ask questions[br]to which you already know the answers ?

01:34:08.44,01:34:10.95
Oh, yes.

01:34:10.95,01:34:13.42
Your continuing search[br]for hope.

01:34:24.46,01:34:28.76
You know this plastic prison of theirs[br]won't hold me forever.

01:34:28.76,01:34:33.40
The war is still coming,[br]Charles, and I intend to fight it...

01:34:33.40,01:34:35.44
by any means necessary.

01:34:37.28,01:34:40.77
And I will always[br]be there,

01:34:40.77,01:34:42.78
old friend.
