00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,796
Wh-Wh-What do you mean? Don't ask
me that! You're the one with the plans.

158
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,258
-[Horse Whinnying]
- Wait, I-I have an idea.

159
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,969
Uh, come on. Give me--
Give me a boost.

160
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,847
Hey, Altivo.

161
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,307
Altivo.

162
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,768
You want a nice apple?
Come and get it.

163

-[Hooves Clattering]
-You have to do a trick for me first.

164
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,607
Huh?
[Sputtering]

165
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,068
All you have to do
is find a pry bar.

166
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:15,324
A long piece of iron
with a hooky thing at the end. Yeah?

167
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,827
-Miguel, you're talking to a horse!
-[Hooves Clattering]

168
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,705
That's it, Altivo,
find the pry bar.

169
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,499
-Yes, find the prybar.
-[Whinnying]

170
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,711
-He can't understand "pry bar."
-[Clattering Continues]

171
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,131
He's a dumb horse.
There's no way--

172
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,592
[Whinnying]

173
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,930
Well, it's not a pry bar.

Oh, thank you, old boy.

177
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:02,162
Listen, if we can
ever return the favor--

178
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:06,208
For Pete's sake, Miguel,
he's a ruthless warhorse, not a poodle.

179
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,168
Come on,
before he licks you to death.

180
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,797
-Adios.
-[Whinnies]

181

Shh, shh. Shh.
Quiet, please.

182
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,012
-What's the matter with him?
-Oh, he wants his apple.

183
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:22,307
-Well, give it to him
before he wakes the whole ship!
-[Bellowing]

184
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,269

00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:54,006
Just hang on!
I'm right here, old boy!

194
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,633
-Have you lost your mind?

[All Gasping]

199
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,734
-Loop the rope under the horse!
-Yes!

200
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,784
On the count of three,
pull back on the rope.

201
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,828
-What? [Gasps]
-Three!

202

-[Tulio] Pull!
-[Grunting]

203

Tulio!
Hey, it worked!

204
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,556
Did any of the supplies make it?

205
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,476
-Well, uh, yes and no.
-[Crunching Sound]

206
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,398
Ohhh, great!

207
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,485
Look on the positive side.
At least things can't get--

208
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,489
Excuse me.
Were you going to say "worse"?

209
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,491
-No. No.
-No? You're sure?

210
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,701
-Absolutely not.
I've revised the whole thing.
-Okay, because--

211
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,913
-[Tulio] Yeah,
we're at least in a rowboat.
-We're in a rowboat, exactly.

it would end like this?

00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,852
-The horse is a surprise.
-[Nickers]

223

Any... regrets?

224

Besides dying?
Yeah.

225
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:25,199
I never... had enough... gold.

226
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,080
My regret, besides dying, is...

227
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:35,667
our greatest adventure
is over before it began,

228

and no one will even remember us.

Well, if it's
any consolation, Miguel,

230

you... made my life...

an adventure.

Hello!

We've done it!

-What's that? The map?
-It's all right here!

The whistling rock!
The stream!

250
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,888
You kept the map, but you couldn't grab
a little more food?

251
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,348
Even those mountains.
You said so yourself:

252
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:16,769
It could be possible.
And it is!

253
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:21,815
It really is... the map to El Dorado!

-You drank seawater, didn't you?
-Oh, come on!

I'm not coming on!

256
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:31,408
I wouldn't set foot in that jungle
for a million pesetas!

257
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,996
-How about a hundred million?
-What?

258
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,666
I just thought that, after all,
since El Dorado is the city of gold--

259
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:43,170
-What's your point?
-You know, dust, nuggets, bricks,

260
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,131
a temple of gold where you can
pluck gold from the very walls.

261
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,133
But you don't want to go, so let's...

262
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,511
get back into the boat
and row back to Spain.

Mmm. Wait a minute.
New plan.

We find the city of gold.
We take the gold,

-and then we go back to Spain.

Pioneers of maximum audacity

Through terra incognita
to a golden shrine

00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:16,168
Oh, no.
Don't worry about me, boys.

470

"My only wish is to serve the gods."
Remember?

471
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:23,843
-How?
-Well, if you guys want the gold,

472
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:25,970
then you don't want
to get caught, right?

473
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:30,016
-You're going to need my help.
-[Scoffs] What makes you
think we need your help?

474
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,312
-"Ck-ck." Are you serious?
-[Whinnies]

475
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:37,398
I-What-We--

476
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:40,276
Okay. So, uh, who are you?

477
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:43,571
-Yeah, uh, what's your angle?
-[Laughs] No angle.

478
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:46,282
-I want in.
-In?

479
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:49,243
-On the scam.
-[Chuckles]

480
00:31:49,327 --> 00:31:51,537
There's no scam!
Why would you think there's a--

481
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:54,707
-Why?
-So I can get out.

482
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:57,001
I thought she just said she wanted in?

483
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:59,420
She wants in so she can get out.

484
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,465
Aha! Got it.
[Chuckles]

485
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:06,510
-W-Why?
-Think you're the only ones
who dream of better things?

486
00:32:06,636 --> 00:32:10,306
Of adventure?
You've got your reasons,

487
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,308
and I've got mine.

488
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,810
Let's not make it personal, okay?

489
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:18,356
-It's just business.
-[Both] Oh.

490
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:21,484
So when you guys
are ready to go back to...

491
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:23,778
wherever you came from,

492
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:26,239
-I'm going with you.
-[Laughs]

493
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:29,283
No!
Don't think so.

494
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:31,285
[Coughs]

495
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:33,496
-[Whistling]
-All right. Fine.

496
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,498
After all, I'm sure you know...

497
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:38,709
the proper rituals
for blessing a tribute,
the holiest days on the calendar--

498
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:42,755
Oh, and of course you know
all about Xibalba.

499
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:45,925
[Chuckles]
Okay? Good luck.

500
00:32:48,553 --> 00:32:51,931
-See you at the execution.
-[Gibberish]

501
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,433
Wait! Ho--
Would you-Hold it.

502
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:01,649
-[Chuckles] Deal?
-Hmm.

503
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:05,486
-Deal.
-Not yet.
Let's just see how this works out.

504
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:09,866
Uh-huh. Well, then I suppose that means
you'll want these back?

505
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:14,954
-How'd you get those?
-Where was she keeping them?

506
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:18,666
-Call me, Chel, your new partner.
-Uh,

507
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:20,668
-that's partner-in-training.
-[Humming]

508
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:22,753
Now, put these on.

509
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:25,089
Your public's waiting.
[Continues]

510
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:28,384
-[Chel Giggling]
-Do you mind?

511
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,428
No.

512
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:32,430
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Giggles]

513
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:34,599
Right. Uh, excuse me.

514
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:37,852
-[Grunting]
-Bye.

515
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:43,941
Mm-mm-mmm! Maybe they should call
this place "Chel Dorado."

516
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:47,069
[Chuckles]
She's whoo--

517
00:33:47,153 --> 00:33:49,280
-Whoa, she's trouble! Wait a minute!
-What?

518
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:51,532
The little voice--
Remember the little voice?

519
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,702
Ju-Ju-Just for a second
imagine that you have one.

520
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:57,371
What would it be saying about Chel?

521
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:01,417
-[Purrs]
-No. No. Listen.

522
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:03,419
-We are partners.
-We are partners.

523
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:07,215
-We have a plan, remember?
-Get the gold. Go back to Spain.

524
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,510
Yes! And we are
pretending to be gods.

525
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:13,596
Now, put Chel in the mix.
What is the voice saying?

526
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:17,308
-Listen carefully.
-[Gasps]

527
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:22,730
-Chel is off-limits, hmm?
-Bravo! Chel is off-limits!

528
00:34:22,814 --> 00:34:24,732
Shake on it.

529
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:27,610
-Off-limits. Mm. Mm.
-[Both] Mmmm.

530
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:30,071
Besides, we're supposed to be gods.

531
00:34:30,196 --> 00:34:32,281
We must avoid
giving in to temptation.

532
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:38,246
-Gods. Oh. This is
gonna be tougher than I thought.
-Tulio, relax!

533
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:42,917
All you have to do is smile,
act godly and follow my lead.

534
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:45,420
[Gasps]

535
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,965
[Gasps] Big smile.
Like you mean it.

536
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,050
A-one, two, three.

537
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:59,725
I hardly think I'm qualified

538
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:02,603
To come across all sanctified

539
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:06,607
I just don't cut it
with the cherubim

540
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:09,277
-[Groaning]
-Tulio, what are you talking about?

541
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:12,405
There again they're on their knees

542
00:35:12,488 --> 00:35:15,032
Being worshipped is a breeze

543
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:17,744
Which rather suits us in

544
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:21,914
-The interim
-Interim, interim
It's me and him

545
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:25,209
Oh, my God!
It's tough to be a god

546
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:29,338
Tread where mortals have not trod

547
00:35:29,464 --> 00:35:34,177
Be deified when really you're a sham

548
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:38,848
Be an object of devotion

549
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,851
Be the subject of psalms

550
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:44,854
It's a rather touching notion

551
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:48,232
All those prayers and those salaams

552
00:35:48,316 --> 00:35:51,569
And who am I to bridle

553
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:54,030
If I'm forced to be an idol

554
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:57,408
If they say that I'm a god

555
00:35:57,492 --> 00:35:59,619
That's what I am

556
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:02,997
What's more if we don't comply

557
00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:05,166
With the locals' wishes

558
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:09,379
I can see us being sacrificed

559
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:11,839
-Or stuffed
-You have a point there.
Very good thinking.

560
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:15,676
-So let's be gods
The perks are great
-Yeah!

561
00:36:15,802 --> 00:36:18,721
-El Dorado on our plates
-Thank you.

562
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:20,932
Local feelings should not

563
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:22,934
-Be rebuffed
-Never rebuffed

564
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:26,729
I never rebuff a local feeling
No, my friend

565
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,898
It's tough to be a god

566
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:32,443
But if you get the people's nod

567
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:35,113
Count your blessings
Yeah, keep 'em sweet

568
00:36:35,196 --> 00:36:38,908
-That's our advice
-It's great advice!

569
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,994
Be a symbol of perfection

570
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,206
Be a legend
Be a cult

571
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:48,042
Take their praise
Take a collection

572
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:51,045
As the multitudes exalt

573
00:36:51,129 --> 00:36:54,257
Don a supernatural habit

574
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:57,677
-We'd be crazy not to grab it
-You got it!

575
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,054
So sign on two new gods

576
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:02,849
For paradise

577
00:37:02,932 --> 00:37:06,978

This city has been granted
a great blessing.

And what have we done
to show our gratitude?

-[Crowd Murmuring]
-No. No.

Hey, Chel, um,
what are they doing?

631
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:38,147
They're sending it to Xibalba,
the spirit world.

632
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:42,610
-The spirit world.
-I'll take care of it.

633
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,073
[Clears Throat]
Um, excuse me, Chief.

634
00:40:47,198 --> 00:40:49,867
The gods have changed their minds
about Xibalba.

635

They wish to bask in the reverence
that has been shown them.

-Not bad at all.

649
00:41:55,808 --> 00:41:59,354
We just became richer
than the king of Spain. [Laughing]

650
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:05,109
You know, speaking of kings, the chief
and high priest seem a bit, uh, tense.

Buenos dÃ­as!

Listen, all we have to do...

653
00:42:09,864 --> 00:42:14,202
is keep playing
the one against the other.

654
00:42:14,285 --> 00:42:17,205
You know, do a little god dance,
chant some mystic mumbo jumbo,

655
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:19,749
dazzle 'em with some smoke and mirrors
and then get the hell back to Spain.

656
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:24,838
Um, Tulio, how are we gonna
get all this back to Spain?

657
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:27,507
Ummm--

658
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,759
-A boat?
-[Tulio] Yeah.

659
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:32,887
Um, we really hate
to be ascending so soon,

660
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:35,473
but, uh, some urgent business
has come up--

661
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:37,767
-family matters-and it's just a bit--
-Yeah, family.

662
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:39,769
Badda-bing, budda-boom,
you know what I mean.

663
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:42,897
Oh, we expected you
to be staying with us...

664
00:42:43,022 --> 00:42:45,859
for the next...
thousand years.

665
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:48,111
Well, as we say
in the spirit world,

666
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:51,781
-there's your plan and then...
there's the gods' plan.
-Mm-hmm.

667
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:54,742
And our plan, uh, calls for a boat,
'cause we're gonna ascend...

668
00:42:54,826 --> 00:42:57,370
-kind of in
a horizontal pattern at first.
-[Chuckles]

669
00:42:57,495 --> 00:43:01,458
And then we're gonna go vertical,
uh, as we get further out to sea.

670
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:04,752
Hmm. To build a boat
large and glorious enough...

671
00:43:04,878 --> 00:43:07,464
would take... about a week.

672
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:10,216
-A week? Hmm.
-Um--

673
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:13,386
I wonder how long it would take
Tzekel-Kan to do it.

674
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:17,265
But-But for the gods,
uh, three days.

675
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,267
Uh--

676
00:43:19,392 --> 00:43:22,145
Well, if that's the best you can do.

677
00:43:22,228 --> 00:43:26,399
Oh, perhaps if you were not burdened
with so much tribute,

678
00:43:26,524 --> 00:43:28,443
you could leave sooner.

679
00:43:28,526 --> 00:43:31,154
-Hmm?
-Hmm? I like it here. Miguel?

680
00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:34,449
Yep, yep.
Three days is just fine.

681
00:43:34,574 --> 00:43:37,035
-[Tulio]No, three days is not fine.

-Miguel, how are we gonna
keep this up for three days?
-[Yawns]

You worry too much.

686

No, I worry exactly the right amount.

687
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:55,845
You can never worry too much.

688

We just have to lie low.

689

But, Tulio, this place is amazing!
I mean, I wonder what's--

No! Don't even move!

-You're moving!

-[Clatter]
-Yes! Exactly.

00:44:23,373 --> 00:44:27,502
For three days.
Don't even breathe. All right?

698
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:30,755
All right.

Hey, where is everybody?

They've been cleared
from the streets, my lord,

741
00:47:02,157 --> 00:47:05,452
so the city can be cleansed,
as you ordered.

-Yes.

an audience with you, my lord.

-Yes, what can I do for you?
-My lord, I have just seen
Lord Miguel out among the people.

810
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:12,949
-Really?
-If I may be so bold as to
offer some advice.

-All right. Shoot.

[Chuckles]
Oh, well. Go on.

814
00:51:20,373 --> 00:51:25,587
But in your perfection, you cannot know
how imperfect humans are.

815
00:51:25,712 --> 00:51:30,842
-Like snakes they are.
Spineless and slippery.
-[Hissing]

-Yeah, yeah, way beyond.
-Then we're in agreement.

821
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,989
I'll begin the necessary
preparations immediately.

822
00:51:53,073 --> 00:51:57,744
Do you wish to have
your victims bound to an altar,
or would you prefer them free-range?

-[Mutters]

00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:05,961
Tzekel, you've lost me.

826
00:52:06,086 --> 00:52:10,048
My lord, these people will not
respect you if they do not fear you.

827
00:52:10,132 --> 00:52:12,592
And, of course, we'll make them
fear us by--

00:52:12,717 --> 00:52:15,262
A sacrifice, as it is prophesied

-Blood!
-Blood! Oh, right.

831
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:24,020
Of course. I should probably
consult with Lord Miguel.

832
00:52:24,104 --> 00:52:28,066
This is fairly important stuff.
I, um, should discuss the entire, uh,

and get out of here now!
-What? Why?

Because the high priest is nuts!

-This is unacceptable!
-Yeah. Yeah. Like he said.

Yes. Yes, it was.
And, um,

1248
01:21:29,725 --> 01:21:34,897
-[Sobbing] it was so much gold!
-[Chuckling]

1249
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,363
-I'm fine.
-Good.

1250
01:21:42,447 --> 01:21:44,866
-Let's go.
-[Sighs]

1251
01:21:50,455 --> 01:21:52,373
Partner.

1252
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:57,837
Partner.

1253
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,965
Hey, guys, come on!

1254
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:03,009
You don't wanna stay here
forever, do you?

1255
01:22:03,092 --> 01:22:06,929
-But... we don't have a map.
-We don't have a plan.

1256
01:22:07,013 --> 01:22:09,140
Well, that's what makes it interesting.

1257
01:22:09,265 --> 01:22:12,685
You're right!
What are we waiting for?

1258
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:14,771
Let's follow that trail!

1259
01:22:14,854 --> 01:22:17,231
-[Whinnying] Hyah!
-[Groaning]

1260
01:22:17,356 --> 01:22:21,611
-Oh, the sweet unfolding
-Come on, boys!

1261
01:22:21,694 --> 01:22:24,072
-Of an antique mystery
-Hey, Altivo!

1262
01:22:24,197 --> 01:22:27,408
-All will be revealed
-Sit, boy! Sit!

1263
01:22:27,492 --> 01:22:31,704
-Chel, we're not on the horse!
-[Chel Laughing]

1264
01:22:31,829 --> 01:22:34,624
On the trail we blaze

1265
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:38,127
[Chittering]

1266
01:22:38,211 --> 01:22:40,380
[Snorting]

1267
01:22:40,505 --> 01:22:42,715
[Twittering] Uh-Uhh.

1268
01:22:42,799 --> 01:22:44,550
Eh! [Crunch]

1269
01:22:44,801 --> 01:22:47,804
Here comes the night

1270
01:22:47,887 --> 01:22:50,723
Here come the memories

1271
01:22:50,807 --> 01:22:53,643
Lost in your arms

1272
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:56,437
Down in the foreign fields

1273
01:22:56,562 --> 01:22:59,982
Not so long ago

1274
01:23:00,066 --> 01:23:02,402
Seems like eternity

1275
01:23:02,485 --> 01:23:07,156
Those sweet afternoons

1276
01:23:07,281 --> 01:23:11,411
Still capture me-e-e

1277
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:17,333
Some day out of the blue

1278
01:23:17,417 --> 01:23:19,585
In a crowded street

1279
01:23:19,711 --> 01:23:23,339
Or a deserted square

1280
01:23:23,423 --> 01:23:26,259
I'll turn and I'll see you

1281
01:23:26,384 --> 01:23:29,303
As if our love were new

1282
01:23:29,429 --> 01:23:32,390
Someday we can start again

1283
01:23:32,473 --> 01:23:35,601
Someday soon

1284
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,273
I still believe

1285
01:23:40,398 --> 01:23:43,317
I still put faith in us

1286
01:23:43,401 --> 01:23:46,362
We had it all

1287
01:23:46,446 --> 01:23:49,532
And watched it slip away

1288
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:52,577
Where are we now

1289
01:23:52,702 --> 01:23:54,996
Not where we want to be

1290
01:23:55,121 --> 01:23:59,709
Those hot afternoons

1291
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:04,005
Still follow me-e-e

1292
01:24:05,506 --> 01:24:09,927
Some day out of the blue

1293
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:12,472
Maybe years from now

1294
01:24:12,555 --> 01:24:15,850
Or tomorrow night

1295
01:24:15,892 --> 01:24:18,811
I'll turn and I'll see you

1296
01:24:18,895 --> 01:24:21,856
As if we always knew

1297
01:24:21,939 --> 01:24:24,901
Someday we would live again

1298
01:24:24,984 --> 01:24:27,654
Some day soon

1299
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:37,205
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-Believe

1300
01:24:37,288 --> 01:24:43,211
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-[Vocalizing]

1301
01:24:43,252 --> 01:24:48,091
-I still believe
I still put faith in us
-Believe

1302
01:24:53,972 --> 01:24:56,808
Here comes the night

1303
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,727
Here come the memories

1304
01:24:59,811 --> 01:25:02,730
Lost in your arms

1305
01:25:02,772 --> 01:25:05,483
Down in the foreign fields

1306
01:25:05,608 --> 01:25:09,028
Not so long ago

1307
01:25:09,153 --> 01:25:11,406
Seems like eternity

1308
01:25:11,489 --> 01:25:16,077
Those sweet afternoons

1309
01:25:16,202 --> 01:25:20,373
Still capture me-e-e

1310
01:25:23,501 --> 01:25:28,006
Someday out of the blue

1311
01:25:28,131 --> 01:25:30,425
Maybe years from now

1312
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:33,803
Or tomorrow night

1313
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:36,806
I'll turn and I'll see you

1314
01:25:36,889 --> 01:25:39,934
As if we always knew

1315
01:25:40,018 --> 01:25:42,937
Someday we would live again

1316
01:25:43,021 --> 01:25:45,940
Someday soon

1317
01:25:58,077 --> 01:26:01,122
The more I learn

1318
01:26:03,207 --> 01:26:06,210
The more I see

1319
01:26:08,338 --> 01:26:15,011
The less the world impassions me

1320
01:26:18,556 --> 01:26:21,142
The hungry heart

1321
01:26:23,686 --> 01:26:26,856
The roving eye

1322
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:31,486
Have come to rest

1323
01:26:31,611 --> 01:26:35,698
Do not apply

1324
01:26:39,285 --> 01:26:41,913
The frantic chase

1325
01:26:44,415 --> 01:26:47,085
The crazy ride

1326
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:52,799
The thrill has gone

1327
01:26:54,884 --> 01:26:58,638
I step aside

1328
01:26:58,721 --> 01:27:01,099
And I'd believe

1329
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,018
In anything

1330
01:27:04,102 --> 01:27:07,230
Were it not for you

1331
01:27:09,107 --> 01:27:11,359
Showing me

1332
01:27:11,442 --> 01:27:14,362
By just existing

1333
01:27:14,445 --> 01:27:17,532
Only this is true

1334
01:27:18,992 --> 01:27:23,830
-I love you
-[Chorus Vocalizing]

1335
01:27:23,913 --> 01:27:29,002
-I love you
-[Vocalizing Continues]

1336
01:27:29,085 --> 01:27:32,380
Without question

1337
01:27:32,505 --> 01:27:36,301
I love you

1338
01:27:48,938 --> 01:27:54,110
-The more I want
-[Chorus] The more I steal

1339
01:27:54,235 --> 01:27:59,199
-The more I steal
-The more I hold

1340
01:27:59,282 --> 01:28:01,701
The more I hold

1341
01:28:01,826 --> 01:28:06,247
The less is real

1342
01:28:09,626 --> 01:28:14,756
-All worldly things
-I follow blind

1343
01:28:14,881 --> 01:28:19,969
-I follow blind
-In hope, not faith

1344
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:22,305
In hope, not faith

1345
01:28:22,388 --> 01:28:26,476
Was paid in kind

1346
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:33,024
The line is drawn

1347
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,071
The change is made

1348
01:28:40,573 --> 01:28:43,660
I come to you

1349
01:28:45,745 --> 01:28:49,541
I'm not afraid

1350
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:52,043
And I'd believe

1351
01:28:52,168 --> 01:28:54,754
In anything

1352
01:28:54,838 --> 01:28:57,882
Were it not for you

1353
01:29:00,093 --> 01:29:02,387
Showing me

1354
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:05,306
By just existing

1355
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:08,184
Only this is true

1356
01:29:09,853 --> 01:29:12,147
I love you

1357
01:29:12,188 --> 01:29:22,198
