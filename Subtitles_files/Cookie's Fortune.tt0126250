1
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:38,277
I oughta be bottom fishing tonight, Billy.
It's nice and breeze.

2
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:40,264
I don't understand it, Lester.

3
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,140
Fish be moving?

4
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:47,087
How men spend all that time
and money try to outsmart fish?

5
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,011
Cause it's fun.

6
00:00:49,158 --> 00:00:51,331
My old buddy Lou, he buys a boat...

7
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,157
Lester!

8
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,707
One of them big purple ones, you know?

9
00:00:56,754 --> 00:00:59,400
Two hours, you'd be dead as a dog without it.

10
00:00:59,463 --> 00:01:00,866
Thank you, Wanda.

11
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:03,539
He put on a football helmet instead of goggles.

12
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:05,253
No life jacket.

13
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,616
Looks like a bullfrog the morning after.

14
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:08,736
Oh, Billy.

15
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:11,049
Says he's going fishing.

16
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:40,521
Hey, now.

17
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:05,178
- Here's to Good Friday.
- Good and getting better.

18
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:30,488
I think it's prissy.

19
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:32,674
I always thought that fishing was for prissies.

20
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:35,695
You, could you tell a bear? You ever see a bear fish?

21
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,155
Damn thing.

22
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:42,735
Damn! Damn!

23
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:08,412
- Hey, Willy!
- Huh?

24
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,599
You back for more?

25
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,576
No, I came back because I need
a big drink of water before I head out.

26
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:40,709
- Ah yeah, that's perfect.
- All right.

27
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,975
- All right, I'm gone again.
- All right.

28
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:45,142
- Check you later.
- Oh, yeah.

29
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:13,826
Ok, the only jug fish I know about is jug in your pocket.

30
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:16,706
I mean, what-what do you think the IQ of a fish is?

31
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:17,793
You know, I mean...

32
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:20,407
- Rejoice not, oh land of Palestine...
- I like to think somebody your size is

33
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:21,863
- too heavy out there.
- Yeah, alright.

34
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,109
The rod of him who smote thee is broken.

35
00:05:25,746 --> 00:05:28,849
The seed of the serpent shall come a basilisk...

36
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,249
- Patrick, no.
- That...

37
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:31,832
Patrick, please.

38
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:33,669
This is not Carnegie Hall.

39
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,802
This is the First Presbyterian Church
that only seats 250 people.

40
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,770
Could you try a little more intimate for me?

41
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,838
Intimate?

42
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:40,968
- Bring it down.
- I know what she means.

43
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,014
Like, like this. Like Shakespeare guy.

44
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:45,934
Rejoice not, oh land of Palestine.

45
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,856
- The rod who smote thee is broken.
- Jason!

46
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:52,909
Excuse me. I think you just
better worry about your own lines.

47
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:57,284
Now, I think the two of you seem
to keep forgetting this is ancient Galilee.

48
00:05:57,326 --> 00:05:58,766
And you in particular, Patrick,

49
00:05:58,813 --> 00:06:02,272
you're playing a character of 200% moral structure.

50
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:06,543
A man with no pretence, no facade, no tricks.

51
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,939
All right?

52
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,226
Maybe it's the words themselves.

53
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:14,596
It needs more blood around the neck, ok?
Be real generous with it.

54
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:17,492
"Smote" means hit across the face.

55
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,230
"Basilisk" is a monster with fatal breath.

56
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,843
Okay, Patrick.

57
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:47,880
Aah!

58
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:20,555
Hey, Emma?

59
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,595
You in there?

60
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,767
Okay, everybody! Let's um...

61
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:47,694
Let's pick it up again with the scene where
the soldiers gathered around the cistern.

62
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:50,524
Just before Salome's entrance, all right?

63
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,157
Oh, Patrick, I want you to stay down.

64
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:54,857
I don't want to see your head over the rim, all right?

65
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:56,037
Never.

66
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:58,845
- Uh, Cory, are you ready?
- Uh-huh.

67
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,003
All right.

68
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,010
Okay?

69
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,881
Begin.

70
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,228
Look, the princess Salome!

71
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,095
- She is getting up to leave...
- Okay, cross over, please.

72
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:12,540
- Remember to cross over...
- She's getting up to leave the table!

73
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,963
- Cross over behind you.
- She's coming towards...

74
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:16,621
I wanna see your face out there
in the audience. All right?

75
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:18,528
She's coming toward us!

76
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:21,346
Don't look at her! It's bad luck to look at the princess.

77
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,320
It will bring harm.

78
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,573
Why does King Herod look at me with mole eyes?

79
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:31,200
- Jason, you'll step on her costume.
- It is strange the husband among other

80
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:32,767
should look at me that way.

81
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:37,830
- Princess, you have left the feast.
- How sweet the air is here.

82
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:40,078
I can breathe here,

83
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:44,618
away from the barbarians
that drink and drink and spill their wine.

84
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:50,942
Oh, how I loathe the Romans,
the Greeks, the Egyptians and the Jews.

85
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:54,921
Not a whole lot has changed since those days, huh?

86
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:01,525
Do not stay here, Princess.

87
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:04,585
I beg of thee. Go back in to the Palace at once.

88
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,620
You must not look at her.
It's dangerous to thyself and myself.

89
00:09:09,787 --> 00:09:13,797
John, it is thy mouth I desire.

90
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,758
Hold it! Hold it!

91
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:20,245
Everybody just hold it! Cora, what were we working on?

92
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:23,630
About your transition from despair to relief.

93
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:26,978
I will say that next. When I look at
the moon and say is a virgin?

94
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:29,254
No, no, I think it should come here.
I think it should come right away.

95
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:30,929
- What does she expect?
- Let's go again.

96
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:32,903
Casting her half-wit sister as Salome...

97
00:09:33,015 --> 00:09:34,845
Come on, I want you to be organic, Cora.

98
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:37,118
I want you to realise the moment, all right?

99
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:41,218
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- The air, the air, the air.

100
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:10,023
Willis, goddamnit!

101
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,190
You scared the living daylight out of me.

102
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:15,888
What the hell you doing down there?

103
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:19,275
Playing Easter bunny? Hiding eggs?

104
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:24,130
I promised Jewel I'd clean these guns tonight.

105
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:27,334
Oh yeah, I know.

106
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:30,578
Of course, it's almost one O'Clock in the morning.

107
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:35,128
Meaning, it's not tonight any more. It's tomorrow.

108
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:37,910
So, you lied!

109
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:43,890
Cookie: 846.

110
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:47,690
Willis: 712.

111
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,815
Where've you been?

112
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:53,121
Uh, I was on...

113
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,003
- I had to go over to Manny's to help...
- Uuh, bullshit, Willis.

114
00:11:57,211 --> 00:12:03,411
You've been to Theo's.
I can smell you all the way over here.

115
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:07,738
Cookie: 847.

116
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,096
I'm gonna make you some coffee.

117
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:14,430
No, that's all right. Go on back to bed, Cookie.

118
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,983
I can do this real quiet light.

119
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:19,896
Oh, forget it. I can't sleep anyway.

120
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:24,787
I've been laying up there
staring at the ceiling for three hours.

121
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,317
Now listen, Willis.

122
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,010
Why don't you go on out back and go to bed.

123
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,895
These guns can wait till tomorrow.

124
00:12:34,023 --> 00:12:37,779
Nope. I said I'd clean them tonight,

125
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:40,252
and I'm gonna clean them tonight.

126
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,813
Now, I need a new line.

127
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:44,258
- Has anybody seen my script?
- Yeah.

128
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,903
What's this? Notes?

129
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:49,803
This time of night?

130
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,260
Man, this is the pits.

131
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:56,520
I only wanted to sign up for this thing
to suck up to Emma's mom and her aunt.

132
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:59,383
And then she left town on you. Women.

133
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,657
Maybe, John the Baptist had the right idea.

134
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,200
Beware when the moon becomes blood

135
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:06,706
and the stars fall on the earth like unripe figs!

136
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:07,753
Sleep well.

137
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,233
Good night, Ms Dixon. See you tomorrow.

138
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,784
- Camille?
- Huh?

139
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,842
Tell me about motivation again.

140
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,921
I am so tired. I can not talk.

141
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,808
Oh, okay.

142
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:28,896
Eighteen down. Author of "The Lottery".

143
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:32,035
- Starts with a...
- Jackson.

144
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:34,775
Shirley Jackson.

145
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:38,616
Greek Sun God.

146
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:41,224
Six letters.

147
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,310
- Last one is an "S".
- Helios.

148
00:13:45,077 --> 00:13:50,317
H-E-L-I-O-S. God of the Sun.

149
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,900
He had a great big old palace up on the hill.

150
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:57,004
Every night when the sun went down...

151
00:13:57,192 --> 00:14:01,552
he rode up to it in a golden boat...

152
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,996
with golden wings.

153
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:06,804
Golden boat.

154
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:08,977
Golden wings.

155
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:10,658
Cookie.

156
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,595
Why do you keep all these guns?

157
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:16,076
Oh...

158
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:18,923
Those guns were Buck's, Willis.

159
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:23,693
And you know, I'll never get rid of
anything that belonged to Buck's.

160
00:14:25,861 --> 00:14:30,461
Now, that one came here with him all the way from Texas.

161
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:33,232
Along with that rifle there.

162
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:36,765
Nineteen hundred and twenty nine.

163
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:40,581
When Buck rode into Holly Springs...

164
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,842
all he had to his name were those two guns.

165
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:49,024
I thought he got this off
that gambler "One-eyed" Jackson.

166
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,371
No.

167
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:55,159
Buck got that Peacemaker there off Jackson.

168
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:59,375
Buck said that Peacemaker's no damn good.

169
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:04,488
It's all bend and crooked or something.
It wouldn't shoot straight.

170
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:09,758
Story goes that Jackson's wife tried
to shoot herself with it.

171
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:15,262
Held it out front of her face,
closed her eyes, squeezed the trigger...

172
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:19,448
and completely missed her head altogether.

173
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:23,577
Where is Jackson now? He still alive?

174
00:15:23,644 --> 00:15:25,790
Oh, no, no...

175
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:29,805
He passed away two years after Buck.

176
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:33,085
Yeah, oh yeah. I remember that all right.

177
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,598
I went to Detroit and you had
to drive yourself to the funeral.

178
00:15:38,908 --> 00:15:41,648
You wrecked my Chrysler.

179
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,952
Willis: 713.

180
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,549
Now, you can't count that again.

181
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,393
- You already counted it once!
- I count it again.

182
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:04,182
I've gotta fix this thing.

183
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:06,662
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- Uh-huh.

184
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:08,762
Tomorrow.

185
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:12,389
Okay, then. Goodnight, Cookie.

186
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:15,089
Have a good one.

187
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:22,313
Damn you, old door.

188
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:27,066
If Buck were here, he'd fix you in half a minute.

189
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:34,892
Oh, goddamn you, Buck.

190
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:40,431
I miss you so much.

191
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:49,756
My God!

192
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:54,443
You're all Peacemakers, aren't you?

193
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:04,588
A golden boat...

194
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,801
with golden wings.

195
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:44,313
Finders keepers,

196
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,296
losers weepers.

197
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:59,125
Willis will never find this one.

198
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,760
Now let me see, where else will I hide 'em?

199
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:08,150
Oh yeah. Let me see now.

200
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,317
Shit.

201
00:18:12,376 --> 00:18:16,403
I'm gonna shoot that bunny if it eats those flowers.

202
00:18:19,142 --> 00:18:20,745
Cora!

203
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,265
Did you lock the door?

204
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:25,772
Oh.

205
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:31,756
I swear, if it wasn't for me,
you'd never get out the front door.

206
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,782
I'm sorry. I'm so dumb when it comes to time.

207
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,046
I wasn't talking about time, Cora.
I was talking about locking the door.

208
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:42,941
Here, Marlene. Come take this from me.

209
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:44,451
- I'm running a little late.
- Good morning.

210
00:18:44,501 --> 00:18:45,921
Good morning.

211
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:50,287
- Cora, where are you going?
- In here.

212
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,377
I hate to keep people waiting.

213
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:18,182
Ohh, that little bugger!

214
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:05,804
- Jesus, Manny! You scared me!
- Morning, Emma.

215
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,750
I brought you some coffee.

216
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:14,666
Is that what you sleep in?

217
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:20,202
Must get awful hot in all those clothes.

218
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:34,920
Hey, Cookie!

219
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,507
Hey, Cookie.

220
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,310
Oh, Willis.

221
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,606
That little Freeman boy next door
borrowed the blue croquet ball.

222
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,442
I bet he thought it was a bigger egg.

223
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,026
Look here, look here, Cookie.

224
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:58,666
Tomorrow's Easter.

225
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:00,659
Have you talked to Camille?

226
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,967
No.

227
00:21:02,505 --> 00:21:05,099
Well, I thought you might have called Camille and Cora.

228
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,446
No.

229
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,165
They're not my family any more.

230
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,779
Hey.

231
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:13,892
Have you heard from Emma?

232
00:21:14,322 --> 00:21:15,798
No!

233
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:19,552
She was supposed to be back by now.

234
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,883
I hope she didn't break down somewhere on the road.

235
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:25,716
Oh, she's back.

236
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:28,696
- Is she?
- Yeah.

237
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:32,870
Her van's parked out there at Manny's catfish shed.

238
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:34,459
Now, Cookie.

239
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,633
I'm gonna have to have a little talk with her.

240
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:42,472
No, you'll be gentle with Emma. She's a good girl.

241
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:48,188
Look here, Cookie.

242
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:52,528
I thought I might make some
catfish enchiladas for tomorrow.

243
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:54,521
Now, what you think?

244
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:57,641
Willis...

245
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:01,288
that Hi-Fi in the den...

246
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:07,053
some-sometimes, you-you have
to jiggle the knob to get it to play right.

247
00:22:15,077 --> 00:22:18,507
I'm fixing to run some errands.
You want anything from the store?

248
00:22:18,593 --> 00:22:22,469
Under my bed is Buck's watches...

249
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,952
and his old piccolo.

250
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:32,009
You want me to get them for you?

251
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:34,823
No.

252
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,641
All right.

253
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:44,681
All right, I'm going now.

254
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:47,992
Bye.

255
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:10,501
Good-bye.

256
00:23:17,707 --> 00:23:20,163
I think Nadine's cherry pie is better than Dolores,

257
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:21,752
but I'm... I'm not gonna tell her.

258
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:23,798
Well, it is.

259
00:23:28,686 --> 00:23:31,662
Now that was an impressive illegal turn.

260
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:32,816
Hey, guys!

261
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,185
Is all right if I go off duty
a little bit this afternoon?

262
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:37,929
Ms Dixon wants me to come down
to the church for my costume fitting.

263
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:39,162
Ask the boss.

264
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:41,841
- Go on.
- Thank you, Billy.

265
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:43,439
Hey, Flash?

266
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,366
Did you hear that Emma Duvall's back in town?

267
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:47,299
Are you on top of that?

268
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:49,592
I hadn't heard that.

269
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:02,168
Marlene, make a note. There's rift we need to fix.

270
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:04,445
And I think is much too long, Jack.

271
00:24:04,463 --> 00:24:05,870
Hhh.

272
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:09,101
Make it a little short.
Give 'em a little leg for their money.

273
00:24:09,566 --> 00:24:12,540
A free play, Jack. It's the church paly, remember?

274
00:24:12,593 --> 00:24:14,833
Nothing in life is free, Camille.

275
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:17,536
Sooner or later, everything has a price.

276
00:24:17,617 --> 00:24:20,381
Any lawyer will tell you that.

277
00:24:20,988 --> 00:24:23,678
The seed of the serpent...

278
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:27,918
Rejoice not, oh land of Palestine because the rod...

279
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:33,376
because the rod of him who smote thee is broken!

280
00:24:33,936 --> 00:24:37,939
- Hey, neighbor!
- Yeah, what does "smote" mean?

281
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,486
Ah...

282
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:41,279
I forgot.

283
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:42,728
What can I get you?

284
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:46,148
Gimme half a pint of bourbon. Make it Wild Turkey.

285
00:24:47,812 --> 00:24:50,694
- Daddy, look!
- Here you go, Willis.

286
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,274
Shall I put it on thy account?

287
00:24:53,336 --> 00:24:56,626
No, it's cash on this one. What you got there, son?

288
00:25:08,689 --> 00:25:10,152
Emma.

289
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:12,419
Willis.

290
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,340
And...

291
00:25:15,887 --> 00:25:17,393
And...

292
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:20,540
And love.

293
00:25:20,743 --> 00:25:22,142
I love you.

294
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,463
Sign...

295
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:25,302
Cookie.

296
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,452
- Hey, Josie, baby!
- Willis!

297
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,586
- What's going on, baby?
- How you doing?

298
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,586
- Ain't nothing but a party.
- Yeah.

299
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:47,426
- Wanna drink?
- No. Never before Tom Brokaw.

300
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,352
- Oh, Lord knows.
- You looking good as ever.

301
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:53,560
- Thank you, sugar.
- Yes, sir.

302
00:25:55,273 --> 00:25:56,560
Yes.

303
00:25:56,877 --> 00:25:59,933
Hey, there. Theo! How you doing?

304
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:02,787
What's going on, Willis?

305
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:04,736
- All right.
- How you been?

306
00:26:04,783 --> 00:26:05,809
Look here.

307
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:08,065
I came by 'cause I...

308
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:12,312
I lost my pocket knife last night. I just thought I...

309
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,352
might have dropped it back here somewhere.

310
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,868
It was little something you came by here mighty early.

311
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:19,602
Yeah, yeah. I was back here
last night getting some water.

312
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,412
I felt it in my pocket, so I must have dropped it...

313
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:24,639
right around here somewhere.

314
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:27,146
Uh-huh.

315
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:31,743
If you find it, hold onto it for me, will you?

316
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,490
I-I-I'll do that for you.

317
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:35,830
- All right. I'll see you.
- Okay.

318
00:26:55,462 --> 00:26:57,376
- Hey, Josie?
- Yeah?

319
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,696
Willis is even again.

320
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:15,283
Hey, Willis.

321
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:20,536
- Need some fish?
- I catch my own fish.

322
00:27:21,158 --> 00:27:23,518
I'm looking for Emma. She around here?

323
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:25,685
She's working.

324
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:29,226
That little girl is something.

325
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,773
I sure am glad she is back.

326
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:41,605
- Catfish!
- Oh, God!

327
00:27:41,692 --> 00:27:42,985
Damn you, Willis!

328
00:27:43,012 --> 00:27:45,032
You scared the holy piss out of me!

329
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:49,021
Hey, the kid is back. Emma Duvall's back in town.

330
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,021
Yes, she is back and she can't
even seem to get her feet wet

331
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,208
before certain people start snooping around

332
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,501
trying to check up on her.

333
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:58,237
Hey, I'm not checking up on you. I just happened by.

334
00:27:58,817 --> 00:28:02,071
Well, I'd love to stay and chat,
but I got a bunch of deliveries to make.

335
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:04,954
At least, 30 pounds to clean before dark.

336
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,661
Hey, listen Emma.

337
00:28:06,927 --> 00:28:08,834
I'm worried about Cookie.

338
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:10,704
Why? What's wrong with her?

339
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:12,877
- She's old.
- Yeah?

340
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,922
- She's old and she needs you.
- Me?

341
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,953
Why would she probably need me? Nobody needs me.

342
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:20,733
I'm a worthless tramp, remember?

343
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:24,169
- Oh, come on, Emma. Don't say that.
- Why not? Mother did.

344
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:28,376
- No, she didn't. Your Aunt Camille did.
- Same difference.

345
00:28:29,156 --> 00:28:32,916
So, what's all this about Cookie?
I mean, she's been old for a long time.

346
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:34,446
Exactly.

347
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:38,156
That's why I worry because
she's got no family to take care of her.

348
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:42,291
To look after when she's not able
to go up those stairs by herself anymore.

349
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,031
And believe me...

350
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:46,891
that day is not long away if you know what I am saying.

351
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:49,774
I know. But, she's got you.

352
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:51,414
Yeah, well...

353
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,006
I'm not exactly family, you know?

354
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,353
Yes, you are. To Aunt Cookie, you are.

355
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,506
To me and her, you are always family.

356
00:28:58,543 --> 00:28:59,623
You know that.

357
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,130
I keep working on the caboose. It's coming out real nice.

358
00:29:03,464 --> 00:29:05,460
What does he mean, "working on the caboose"?

359
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:06,714
My new house.

360
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,640
What? Oh, come on!

361
00:29:08,694 --> 00:29:10,710
- You can't live in no caboose!
- I can't?

362
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,470
No, you can't. It ain't safe.

363
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,618
Willis, you worry too much. Just relax!

364
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:16,465
You listen to me, Emma Duvall.

365
00:29:16,518 --> 00:29:19,445
I can't let you do this. You got family here.

366
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:22,840
Now, why don't you just come on over
to Cookie's and stay for a while.

367
00:29:22,946 --> 00:29:26,560
She got more than enough room
and she'd like it. A whole lot.

368
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,866
Willis, I mean, uh. I just... Maybe later. Not now.

369
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,372
All right. Look, do me a favour.

370
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:32,978
Drop me off at the square, all right?

371
00:29:33,628 --> 00:29:35,084
Manny will look after me.

372
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:38,278
And besides, he said he's got a lot extra furnitures.

373
00:29:39,184 --> 00:29:41,471
Yeah, I've seen the bed.

374
00:30:38,023 --> 00:30:42,316
- You smell like fish.
- Yeah, you smell like turkey.

375
00:31:01,138 --> 00:31:03,780
How long you've been sleeping in that van?

376
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,966
That ain't safe, you know?

377
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,577
I know.

378
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:09,930
I found that out in Biloxi.

379
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:12,962
That's why you came back?

380
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:15,989
Yep. You take that for me?

381
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:18,469
What happens down there?

382
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,621
Nothing.

383
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:23,441
You tried going home yet?

384
00:31:23,788 --> 00:31:24,841
Yeah, I tried.

385
00:31:24,895 --> 00:31:29,171
It lasted about an hour before Aunt Camille
kicked me out of the house again, for good.

386
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,238
Camille?

387
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:32,404
What about your mother? What she had to say about it?

388
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:35,086
What do you think she had to say?

389
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:39,552
- Emma, is that you?
- Yeah.

390
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:43,028
You and Manny going to have
to get my catfish over earlier.

391
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:45,208
A lot of people are here earlier.

392
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:59,106
I know, Camille, you're right. You're always right.

393
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,782
Hey, Jason.

394
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,551
No, that's... Jason, that's my hat.

395
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:04,184
Jason, where have you been? You're late.

396
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:06,700
Your stuff is on the rack over there.
Go get it, put it on.

397
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:10,205
- This is a real pretty.
- Uh-huh. It's shiny too.

398
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:12,145
- It's really nicely done.
- Yeah.

399
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:13,745
- Ms Duvall?
- Uh-huh.

400
00:32:13,804 --> 00:32:16,520
Uh, I heard Emma is back in town. Is that right?

401
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,328
Oh yes, she is. She just got back...

402
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,643
Jason, just because you're a policeman,

403
00:32:19,693 --> 00:32:21,357
that doesn't mean you can stroll your feet and legs

404
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,540
make us all wait and stand around
ask questions that don't concern you.

405
00:32:24,586 --> 00:32:26,849
Now, hurry up and get dressed.

406
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:28,049
Wanna go home.

407
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:29,958
That's simple, you know.

408
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:33,235
I already got one.

409
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,738
Oh, Buck.

410
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,912
I love you.

411
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:07,561
All-All I'm saying is this here.

412
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:10,461
Cookie, she been talking a lot of weird shit lately.

413
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:12,808
Saying stuff just doesn't make any sense.

414
00:33:13,263 --> 00:33:15,749
Now, I think she's starting to lose it.

415
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:19,343
I'm not asking anything major here, Emma.
I'm just asking you to do one thing.

416
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:20,503
What's that?

417
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:23,656
Come over and have Easter dinner
with me and Cookie tomorrow.

418
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:27,658
Come on. It's just for an afternoon, please.

419
00:33:28,078 --> 00:33:31,005
For Cookie. Come on. She misses you.

420
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:34,451
You're the only person left means anything to her.

421
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:40,038
We're having catfish enchiladas.

422
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,588
All right, all right, I'll come.

423
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:48,541
Ha-ha, hot dog! Look, come on about noon, okay?

424
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:53,234
Cookie gonna be in heaven!
Oh, man! She gonna be in heaven.

425
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:56,934
Yeah, I got your heaven, Willis!

426
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:32,944
Here I come, Buck.

427
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:39,522
I'm gonna be in a golden boat with golden wings.

428
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:13,618
Thou rejectest me. Thou speak evil words against me...

429
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:15,256
Cora?

430
00:35:15,324 --> 00:35:17,736
Cora, I didn't cut out that speech
'cause I thought we'd do it a justice.

431
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:18,891
But now, I'm not too sure.

432
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:21,317
You're gonna get more, more vitality in your voice.

433
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,615
- Sexuality.
- As to a harlot.

434
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:25,341
- As to a woman that is long...
- Wait here. I'll be right back.

435
00:35:25,383 --> 00:35:28,962
No, no. Don't. I'll be right back. I'll be just a second.

436
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:31,680
As to a harlot.

437
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,040
As to a woman that is long to me, Salome.

438
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,169
Well, I still live, but thou are dead.

439
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:45,561
Jewel Mae?!

440
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:48,368
Jewel Mae?

441
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:50,726
Jewel Mae, I've been calling you all day.

442
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,146
Where are you? Why don't you answer your telephone?

443
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,934
I know you're here!

444
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:03,749
If you just pick up the telephone like a normal person.

445
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:05,623
Jewel Mae!

446
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:10,373
I need Mother's fruit salad bowl!

447
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:13,855
Why does she have to act this way?

448
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:15,364
It was Mother's bowl, you know.

449
00:36:15,404 --> 00:36:18,484
I need it for Easter dinner with
the Tippetts and Hendersons are coming.

450
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,547
And I need the fruit-salad bowl.

451
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,748
Fine.

452
00:36:23,776 --> 00:36:26,036
You want to act like a child? Fine.

453
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:28,908
I'll just find the thing myself.

454
00:36:36,017 --> 00:36:37,390
Oh.

455
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,630
Oh!

456
00:36:40,913 --> 00:36:44,053
Oh, it's disgraceful!

457
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:45,709
Disgusting!

458
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:47,955
If I ever...

459
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:55,582
Jewel Mae?

460
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,629
Well, okay.

461
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:01,382
Whatever.

462
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:06,553
I'm taking your... I mean, Mother's fruit salad bowl!

463
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:28,275
Jewel Mae?

464
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,071
Jewel Mae?

465
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,225
Are you up here?

466
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:51,235
Thy voice with the sense of scattered strange perfumes

467
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:53,582
and when I look on me, I heard strange music.

468
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:56,665
Oh, wherefore didst thou, now look at me, Jo...

469
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:58,011
Yo...

470
00:37:58,287 --> 00:37:59,729
Camille...

471
00:38:00,336 --> 00:38:02,103
Jokana...

472
00:38:07,862 --> 00:38:09,630
Darn it.

473
00:38:52,487 --> 00:38:54,171
Camille!

474
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,954
Dear Willis,

475
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:22,474
Buck needs me. And I need him.

476
00:39:22,832 --> 00:39:26,035
By the time you read this, I'll be with him.

477
00:39:26,082 --> 00:39:27,442
Camille!

478
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:32,908
Now don't be sad, Willis, and tell Emma not to be sad...

479
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:35,248
because I'm happy.

480
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:36,302
Camille!

481
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:43,169
By the way, the final score is Cookie: 849...

482
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:46,282
Willis: 712.

483
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:49,085
Catch you later, Cookie.

484
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:53,415
Camille! You broke the fruit salad bowl!

485
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,255
Darn! How can we have fruit salad now?

486
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:05,660
Cora! Cora, come here.

487
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:14,323
I'll tell you here, I got...

488
00:40:14,593 --> 00:40:15,899
Stop it.

489
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:18,969
Cora...

490
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,316
- Cora, wait. What are you doing?
- I'm gonna call the police!

491
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,092
No, you can't do that. You can't call anybody, not yet.

492
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,972
Get back to our salad...

493
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,272
God! Look at what you've done, Cora.

494
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:34,586
I'm bleeding!

495
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:36,034
Cora, sit down!

496
00:40:36,077 --> 00:40:37,517
Oh, this is awful. This is terrible.

497
00:40:37,557 --> 00:40:39,051
- We have to do something!
- Keep your voice down, Cora.

498
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:41,617
- You're gonna disturb the neighbors!
- But Camille, Aunt Jewel shot herself!

499
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:43,954
We don't know that. We don't know that.
Aunt Jewel shot herself!

500
00:40:43,994 --> 00:40:45,007
What do you mean?

501
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:47,177
All we know was Aunt Jewel was shot. Period.

502
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:49,291
But the gun was in her hand. She must...

503
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,112
Don't always go for the obvious, Cora. Just think!

504
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:56,364
What are you eating?

505
00:40:56,898 --> 00:40:58,804
Nothing.

506
00:41:00,904 --> 00:41:02,344
Now...

507
00:41:03,054 --> 00:41:05,607
You just listen to me, alright?

508
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:09,421
Aunt Jewel did not commit suicide.

509
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:14,321
Nobody in this family commits suicide.
Suicide is a disgrace.

510
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:16,241
Only crazy people commit suicide.

511
00:41:16,295 --> 00:41:18,425
So, that's what some... some robber,

512
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:21,035
some murderer is trying to make this look like.

513
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:22,531
Well, they ain't gonna get away with this.

514
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:24,768
So, you just forget that you saw that gun in her hand.

515
00:41:24,795 --> 00:41:25,802
You hear me?

516
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:29,905
It was not there. Aunt Jewel did not commit suicide.

517
00:41:30,228 --> 00:41:32,238
Now, Cora.

518
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:34,344
Look at me.

519
00:41:34,398 --> 00:41:36,714
Look at me, Cora. All right? Now...

520
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:40,747
Aunt Jewel did not commit suicide.

521
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,077
Aunt Jewel did not commit suicide.

522
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,157
- Suicide...
- is a disgrace.

523
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,706
- Only crazy people...
- Only crazy people...

524
00:41:48,746 --> 00:41:51,373
- commit...
- suicide.

525
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:10,466
- Hey.
- Hey, Emma.

526
00:42:17,223 --> 00:42:18,899
Manny?

527
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,393
Manny, what's going on?

528
00:42:23,928 --> 00:42:25,851
I'm getting some light in here for you.

529
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,764
Can't have you dress and undress in the dark.

530
00:42:33,457 --> 00:42:36,024
- Hey there, Nel.
- Hey, Willis.

531
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,066
I heard Cookie is had the flu. Is that true?

532
00:42:39,113 --> 00:42:42,459
Yeah, it's true. She's alright though.

533
00:42:44,341 --> 00:42:46,324
I can't believe this.

534
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:49,024
I just can't believe it!

535
00:42:49,598 --> 00:42:51,621
Of all the selfish...

536
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:53,841
disgraceful...

537
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:56,508
disgusting...

538
00:42:57,229 --> 00:43:02,248
I'll get all of this out of here once and for all.

539
00:43:03,871 --> 00:43:06,380
You here was given everything...

540
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:09,093
and look what you did with it?

541
00:43:15,298 --> 00:43:18,940
I'll tell you one thing. You're just lucky that I'm here.

542
00:43:21,247 --> 00:43:24,696
Lucky for you I can think so fast on my feet.

543
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:28,990
Yeah.

544
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:43,742
Now.

545
00:43:44,027 --> 00:43:46,200
Get it out of your hand.

546
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:50,980
Let go!

547
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:56,062
How dare you do this to me, you crazy old lady!

548
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:05,906
Now, how they get out?

549
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,540
Who?

550
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,529
See, he'd come in?

551
00:44:12,246 --> 00:44:15,055
I think he would come in the back door.

552
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:36,002
Then he comes over here...

553
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:37,876
from there...

554
00:44:37,956 --> 00:44:39,908
run and run...

555
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:04,796
Cora.

556
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:06,409
Now...

557
00:45:08,753 --> 00:45:11,337
I ant you to tell me what happened, all right?

558
00:45:11,698 --> 00:45:13,458
Pretend I'm the law.

559
00:45:13,784 --> 00:45:15,161
Now, Miss Duvall.

560
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:16,728
Can you tell me what happened here?

561
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:19,464
Some robber, some murderer
killed Aunt Jewel, murdered her.

562
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:21,500
Good girl. All right. Now we got to call the police.

563
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:23,270
- You call them. Okay?
- What's the number?

564
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:24,364
You know what to say.

565
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:25,700
But, he's not fishing.

566
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,922
I mean, he's just buzzing around the lake.

567
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,859
Yeah, but you still...

568
00:45:30,086 --> 00:45:34,482
You have 1500 pounds of boat, 200 pounds of motor...

569
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:36,376
six fishing poles...

570
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:38,176
- 40 pounds of lead.
- Holly Springs Sheriff's Office.

571
00:45:38,223 --> 00:45:40,489
- This is Wanda speaking.
- To pull up 3 pounds of fish.

572
00:45:40,543 --> 00:45:41,839
- It is.
- You know, you can tell

573
00:45:41,893 --> 00:45:44,946
a whole lot about the man
just by the color of his fishing rod.

574
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:46,692
I don't know. I worry about how...

575
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,824
Ok, just a minute. You said 411 Van Buren?

576
00:45:50,903 --> 00:45:52,564
Yes ma'am. 411 Van Buren.

577
00:45:52,605 --> 00:45:54,731
It's my Aunt Jewel. She's... she's dead.

578
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:56,148
She's been murdered.

579
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:58,361
She's upstairs in the bedroom. And she's... she's white

580
00:45:58,408 --> 00:46:00,841
like lilies in the field that the mower had never mowed.

581
00:46:00,886 --> 00:46:04,192
And there's blood everywhere.
Red like coral the fish have found

582
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:05,892
in the twilight of the sea.

583
00:46:06,006 --> 00:46:07,353
Ah, yes ma'am.

584
00:46:07,646 --> 00:46:09,829
Hold on just a minute.

585
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:36,736
Well...

586
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:40,449
- Fancy seeing you here in Holly Springs.
- Why are you wearing that for?

587
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:43,772
My uniform? I'm an officer of
the sheriff's department now.

588
00:46:43,812 --> 00:46:45,538
The sheriff's department? You're a cop now?

589
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,772
Sure am.

590
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:48,888
Great. Congratulations.

591
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:52,275
I'm still a criminal and you're the law.
Our timing continues to suck.

592
00:46:52,322 --> 00:46:53,622
Oh, hey, I am not the one who took off

593
00:46:53,662 --> 00:46:55,965
in the middle of the night without even a phone call.

594
00:46:56,051 --> 00:46:58,182
What you expect me to do?
Stay around here looking at the horizon

595
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,585
waiting for you to come back?

596
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:02,417
Hey.

597
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,790
- What happened to your face?
- I fell.

598
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:10,213
Jason, you there? Jason, it's Wanda.

599
00:47:10,258 --> 00:47:13,959
We got a 10-47. Subject is possibly 10-7.

600
00:47:14,093 --> 00:47:18,089
Jason, respond ASAP. Stand by for location.

601
00:47:21,748 --> 00:47:23,571
Hey, Cookie...

602
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,277
So, I came in and I saw glass
all over the floor in the kitchen.

603
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,430
And then there the gun case, and...

604
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:33,575
and I knew immediately that something was wrong.

605
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:35,429
I called out for her. She didn't answer me.

606
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:37,928
That's when I ran straight up
to her bedroom and found her.

607
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,966
Mrs Duvall, were you present with your sister

608
00:47:40,013 --> 00:47:41,673
when she's discovered Cookie's body?

609
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:43,220
Jewel Mae, officer.

610
00:47:43,287 --> 00:47:46,080
Jewel Mae Orcutt. Her name is Jewel Mae.

611
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:48,002
Cookie?

612
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:50,169
Cookie, what's going on here?

613
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:53,485
My-my sister heard a scream,
came running. I mean she's here.

614
00:47:53,532 --> 00:47:55,105
Somebody broke in and shot her.

615
00:47:55,152 --> 00:47:57,391
She's... she's dead, officer.

616
00:47:57,745 --> 00:47:59,095
I think whoever it was,

617
00:47:59,134 --> 00:48:02,955
maybe they, they, they broke in the door
and they, they smashed the gun case,

618
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:06,781
they got one of guns to, to rob her. I, I guess.

619
00:48:06,955 --> 00:48:10,269
Aunt Jewel had a lot of valuable jewellery we ever know.

620
00:48:10,335 --> 00:48:14,003
She had a diamond and ruby necklace
that was worth a fortune.

621
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:16,830
At least two or three hours.

622
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:38,081
Jason, put that damn thing the hell away.

623
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:40,752
Wanda said there's been a robbery and murder over here.

624
00:48:40,825 --> 00:48:43,214
Go on in and find Lester.

625
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,894
Don't do anything he don't tell you to do.

626
00:48:46,014 --> 00:48:47,627
Yes, sir.

627
00:48:57,588 --> 00:48:59,162
And where's Lester?

628
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,762
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

629
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:02,028
Batesville forensics.

630
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:04,128
I'm supposed to report to Lester Boyle.

631
00:49:04,189 --> 00:49:05,668
He's upstairs.

632
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:08,980
- Hey, Jason.
- Hi. Excuse me.

633
00:49:15,131 --> 00:49:17,505
Lester! I'm here!

634
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:21,431
Jesus! Get... Watch... Watch... Back up. Back out.

635
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:25,187
All right, son. You come in...

636
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,743
That's evidence. Just...
You be careful what you're doing, okay?

637
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,370
You just be careful what you're doing.

638
00:49:32,993 --> 00:49:34,284
Jesus!

639
00:49:34,777 --> 00:49:37,004
- What happened?
- Ms Orcutt, shot in the head.

640
00:49:37,051 --> 00:49:38,353
Died instantly. Go figure.

641
00:49:38,387 --> 00:49:39,673
- We hope...
- Those are brains?

642
00:49:39,707 --> 00:49:41,447
Don't know. We haven't found the weapon yet.

643
00:49:41,494 --> 00:49:43,434
Just looks like the robbery here.

644
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:47,040
This is bad.

645
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,900
This is bad.

646
00:49:49,827 --> 00:49:51,187
Emma...

647
00:49:51,977 --> 00:49:53,899
Who's gonna tell Emma?

648
00:49:54,184 --> 00:49:56,298
Do we know who did it yet?

649
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:58,393
You smell fish in here?

650
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,592
- How's it going, Eddie?
- No shortage of prints here.

651
00:50:39,673 --> 00:50:42,016
Got a real nice set off the outside kitchen window.

652
00:50:42,049 --> 00:50:43,169
Maybe, the point of entry.

653
00:50:43,202 --> 00:50:46,029
I'm going on back to check for footprints.

654
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:48,117
You stay here and don't move.

655
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:51,417
Don't say anything to anybody. Not one word.

656
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,826
Officer Cox...

657
00:50:57,592 --> 00:50:59,153
I just think this is how the robber left the house.

658
00:50:59,193 --> 00:51:00,613
- Ms Dixon!
- I think he probably...

659
00:51:00,652 --> 00:51:02,442
Ms Dixon, please don't come out here.

660
00:51:02,502 --> 00:51:04,015
Then he broke that door.

661
00:51:04,048 --> 00:51:05,388
- You know, to get in.
- Ms Dixon!

662
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:08,052
- So, he must come back out...
- You can't be out here like this.

663
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:09,225
- I just...
- You can't be out here.

664
00:51:09,258 --> 00:51:11,212
You're gonna be stepping all over the evidence.

665
00:51:11,257 --> 00:51:13,398
Oh, oh, footprints!

666
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,500
Now, the wall is all messup now.

667
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:16,993
- But then...
- Ms Dixon...

668
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:18,750
this is a crime scene now.

669
00:51:18,783 --> 00:51:20,483
- I know you're in shock.
- I just think...

670
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:22,573
- I completely understand.
- He jumped across that fence there.

671
00:51:22,623 --> 00:51:24,794
- You got to let us do our work here.
- Hid in those bushes here.

672
00:51:24,844 --> 00:51:25,957
And then... Oh!

673
00:51:26,264 --> 00:51:27,995
What's wrong? What is it?

674
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:29,429
Look.

675
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,224
You specialise in being in the way?

676
00:51:51,822 --> 00:51:53,651
I'm sorry, Ms Duvall.

677
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,798
This is awful.

678
00:51:58,388 --> 00:52:00,357
I just saw Emma a little bit ago.

679
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:02,044
She's gonna be...

680
00:52:02,158 --> 00:52:04,658
you know, freaked about this.

681
00:52:06,176 --> 00:52:08,699
She really cared about that old lady.

682
00:52:12,624 --> 00:52:14,578
Who's gonna tell Emma?

683
00:52:19,582 --> 00:52:20,965
Ms Duvall?

684
00:52:22,294 --> 00:52:23,672
Willis?

685
00:52:24,745 --> 00:52:27,245
I sure am sorry about this.

686
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:30,822
I can't believe it, Lester.

687
00:52:31,156 --> 00:52:33,828
Cookie's dead. Shot.

688
00:52:37,647 --> 00:52:39,661
It's a tough one.

689
00:52:56,523 --> 00:52:57,822
Willis?

690
00:52:57,923 --> 00:52:59,323
- Hhh?
- Oh...

691
00:52:59,462 --> 00:53:01,889
Were you around here most of today?

692
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:06,475
Except when I had to run some errands and uh...

693
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,416
buy groceries.

694
00:53:08,776 --> 00:53:10,659
What time was that?

695
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:14,339
I don't know. 1:00.

696
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:16,492
1:30 maybe.

697
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:19,371
Anybody go with you?

698
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:21,804
No. No.

699
00:53:22,094 --> 00:53:25,664
Well, I was with Emma for while.

700
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:30,736
Willis, I'm sorry to ask this.

701
00:53:30,796 --> 00:53:33,649
But, would you mind coming down to the station with us?

702
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:35,783
Don't worry. It's a routine.

703
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:38,378
We need all the clues we can get.

704
00:53:38,565 --> 00:53:42,592
Since you live here, I can damn sure use some help.

705
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:46,856
Here, well, let, let me put your groceries away for you.

706
00:53:47,196 --> 00:53:50,929
Oh, you, you got your shirt all wet, Willis.

707
00:54:18,694 --> 00:54:22,041
Willis! What you doing?

708
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:04,522
Willis! What're you going up there for?

709
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,622
What's going on? What did you do?

710
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,870
What happened to your shirt?

711
00:55:17,057 --> 00:55:18,604
What's wrong?

712
00:55:19,136 --> 00:55:22,219
- It's Cookie.
- What about her?

713
00:55:24,145 --> 00:55:25,206
She's dead.

714
00:55:25,259 --> 00:55:27,171
Aunt Cookie? What you mean?

715
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,746
- It's worse. She was shot.
- Shot?

716
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:31,239
What do you mean shot?

717
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,166
I don't know. They found her at the house.

718
00:55:34,842 --> 00:55:37,118
She was shot at the house.

719
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:40,565
Somebody shot her at the house.

720
00:55:41,614 --> 00:55:43,264
Oh, God!

721
00:56:41,044 --> 00:56:42,886
Look, what more can I say?

722
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:45,632
His prints are the only ones
on the gun beside the victims.

723
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,215
They're all over the gun case,

724
00:56:47,262 --> 00:56:49,355
the back door knob and the outside kitchen window.

725
00:56:49,396 --> 00:56:51,322
I think that's easy to explain.

726
00:56:51,405 --> 00:56:54,452
Look, I'm not saying there's enough
evidence to substantiate guilt, Lester.

727
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:57,888
But in my expert opinion,
we ought to hold him on suspicion.

728
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,401
At least, till we establish
the time of death and get some alibis.

729
00:57:00,448 --> 00:57:03,711
Yeah, he lives in this house.
He cared for that old woman.

730
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,419
Now, your house in Batesville,

731
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:08,666
do you clean things up, move things round sometimes?

732
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,101
- It's more complicated than that, Lester.
- Yeah, you still live with your momma?

733
00:57:12,501 --> 00:57:14,355
He had nothing to do with it, all right?

734
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:16,263
He's innocent.

735
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,449
You can trust me on that.

736
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:20,673
And what makes you so sure of that, Lester?

737
00:57:20,727 --> 00:57:22,207
Because...

738
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,400
I fished with him.

739
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:50,422
Willis?

740
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:51,890
Uh, yes, yes, sir.

741
00:57:51,937 --> 00:57:54,373
I got good news, I got bad news.

742
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:58,896
The good news is, Lester is almost
always right, 9 times out of 10.

743
00:57:58,969 --> 00:58:03,709
The bad news is, we got to
detain you for suspicion of murder

744
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:05,136
of Ms. Jewel Mae Orcutt.

745
00:58:05,169 --> 00:58:08,748
Oh, come on. Y'all, y'all got this thing all wrong now.

746
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:10,372
I was coming from the supermarket.

747
00:58:10,405 --> 00:58:12,132
I didn't have nothing to do with that, Billy.

748
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:13,892
I know it's a damn mess, but...

749
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:17,101
you know, we'll get everybody in here
all at the one time and square this away.

750
00:58:17,128 --> 00:58:21,201
Yeah, but we, we planned our Easter
dinner, Cookie and I, for tomorrow.

751
00:58:38,873 --> 00:58:41,066
Look at this mess.

752
00:58:44,076 --> 00:58:46,428
Camille, maybe we're not supposed to be here.

753
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:47,638
Cora...

754
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,426
Hey, you think the police could, at least,

755
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:01,186
take their stupid crime tape
with them when they were leaving.

756
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,700
All right, nobody's right here. So, it's ok.

757
00:59:27,399 --> 00:59:28,799
Freeze!

758
00:59:28,892 --> 00:59:32,535
Oh, Jason, put that thing away. You scared us to death!

759
00:59:34,128 --> 00:59:36,002
Ms Dixon, what are you all doing over here?

760
00:59:36,061 --> 00:59:39,541
We're going into our house, that's what.
What are you doing here?

761
00:59:39,804 --> 00:59:43,181
Chief Deputy Cox told me to stay here
and make sure no-one came in. I...

762
00:59:43,463 --> 00:59:45,496
I don't think I can let you all in right now.

763
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:48,503
Jason, if I were you, I'd go home and study the lines.

764
00:59:48,536 --> 00:59:50,456
We'll take it from here.

765
00:59:51,122 --> 00:59:53,248
Would you open the door?

766
00:59:57,232 --> 00:59:58,294
Goodnight.

767
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:00,502
Goodnight, Jason. Thank you.

768
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:08,571
Jason to Wanda. Jason to Wanda.

769
01:00:08,665 --> 01:00:09,992
Go ahead, Jason.

770
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,558
I got a B and E over here...

771
01:00:13,464 --> 01:00:14,967
at the crime house.

772
01:00:15,034 --> 01:00:16,367
Uh...

773
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:21,690
I'm a, I'm a 10-23 requesting uh 10-34.

774
01:00:22,628 --> 01:00:25,311
10-23 for 10-34.

775
01:00:26,243 --> 01:00:29,305
I got two 10-82s J-I...

776
01:00:30,984 --> 01:00:32,848
Possible 10-30...

777
01:00:34,452 --> 01:00:37,458
Could you just ask Billy to come on down here, please?

778
01:00:38,587 --> 01:00:40,368
I knew it. I knew this'd happen.

779
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:41,924
You should have left someone there beside that kid.

780
01:00:41,957 --> 01:00:44,750
Slow down, Eddie. We're not
talking about Jack the Ripper.

781
01:00:44,803 --> 01:00:47,353
- Really?
- It's just a couple of women.

782
01:00:47,554 --> 01:00:50,083
But, the integrity of the crime scene
has been compromised.

783
01:00:50,123 --> 01:00:53,054
Some smart-assed lawyer could have
a hay-day with me at the witness stand.

784
01:00:53,104 --> 01:00:54,810
I don't want to look like some fool.

785
01:00:55,002 --> 01:00:57,669
There's little debate for this, okay?

786
01:01:05,486 --> 01:01:08,700
Miss Dixon? What the hell is this?

787
01:01:08,753 --> 01:01:12,113
Oh, it's just stupid crime tape. Right Camille?

788
01:01:12,546 --> 01:01:16,060
Miss Dixon, I told you before and I'm telling you again.

789
01:01:16,142 --> 01:01:19,036
This house is off limits. Nobody can stay in here.

790
01:01:19,061 --> 01:01:22,218
Billy, you know this house is ours now, you know that.

791
01:01:22,285 --> 01:01:25,108
Now, Cora and I, you see, are Aunt Jewel's nieces.

792
01:01:25,154 --> 01:01:27,464
- We are her only relatives.
- Well, except Emma.

793
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:29,183
- Don't forget Emma.
- Oh yes, Emma Duvall.

794
01:01:29,217 --> 01:01:31,070
- That's Cora's daughter.
- Everyone in our sheriff"s office

795
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:32,284
- knows Emma.
- Uh-huh.

796
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,833
Miss Dixon, for the time being...

797
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,440
this house is owned by nobody.

798
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,633
And you possibly destroy crucial evidence.

799
01:01:39,678 --> 01:01:42,064
We're holding a man down the station
for questioning in this murder.

800
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:44,277
- You're holding somebody?
- Yes, ma'am.

801
01:01:44,311 --> 01:01:46,631
We're holding Mr. Willis Richland.

802
01:01:46,678 --> 01:01:48,978
- Willis? You're holding Willis?
- Yes, ma'am.

803
01:01:49,012 --> 01:01:50,652
- His prints were all over the gun.
- No!

804
01:01:50,692 --> 01:01:52,405
Not to mention a few other things.

805
01:01:52,562 --> 01:01:54,255
Well, nothing's official now.

806
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:57,161
We're waiting for confirmation
on the alleged murder weapon.

807
01:01:57,186 --> 01:01:58,734
- O.. Officer.
- We're checking alibis.

808
01:01:58,775 --> 01:02:00,462
I, I don't think you have the right man.

809
01:02:00,547 --> 01:02:02,056
- Honestly...
- Billy, I, I think we're just

810
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:04,524
in a little bit of state of shock here.

811
01:02:04,562 --> 01:02:06,884
I mean, I just think we need a little bit of time.

812
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:10,234
This news about Willis Richland is most disturbing.

813
01:02:10,302 --> 01:02:13,467
Well, I can hardly believe it either,
but he's only lead we got.

814
01:02:13,508 --> 01:02:15,789
Well, Billy. Maybe, you made a mistake...

815
01:02:15,855 --> 01:02:18,589
Damn right, someone made a mistake.

816
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,456
Oh, Emma. Oh, honey.

817
01:02:21,506 --> 01:02:25,069
- Baby, let Momma give you a hug.
- You just stay away from me, Momma.

818
01:02:25,103 --> 01:02:27,316
Don't touch me.

819
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:30,334
All you people are nuts!

820
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:35,807
Willis did not shoot Aunt Cookie, Billy.
There's no way that Willis did this.

821
01:02:35,955 --> 01:02:38,065
He loved her.

822
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,593
And he's probably the only person besides me

823
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:42,354
that will even go to her damn funeral!

824
01:02:42,385 --> 01:02:44,123
Watch what you say in this house young lady.

825
01:02:44,173 --> 01:02:46,346
Oh, this house!

826
01:02:46,714 --> 01:02:49,488
What? Llike it's your house all of a sudden, huh?

827
01:02:49,614 --> 01:02:52,221
Well, I will say whatever I please in this house,

828
01:02:52,254 --> 01:02:53,694
because this is Cookie's house!

829
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:55,057
Emma, honey. It's ok.

830
01:02:55,091 --> 01:02:56,771
Cora, enough!

831
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,294
Leave her alone.

832
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,494
As far as the funeral goes,

833
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:03,294
I just hope you find something
a little more tasteful than that.

834
01:03:03,985 --> 01:03:07,688
I hate you, you stupid insensitive bitch!

835
01:03:08,961 --> 01:03:11,974
Alright, ladies. Let's go home.

836
01:03:13,507 --> 01:03:16,761
They read you your rights, didn't they? - Yeah.

837
01:03:16,888 --> 01:03:18,618
They gave me coffee...

838
01:03:18,751 --> 01:03:22,844
and a field of string magazine,
but I can't concentrate too good right now.

839
01:03:22,877 --> 01:03:24,764
That's understandable.

840
01:03:24,856 --> 01:03:27,665
Okay, let's talk about your whereabouts today.

841
01:03:27,765 --> 01:03:29,712
Start with this morning.

842
01:03:29,904 --> 01:03:31,599
Uh, look here, Jack.

843
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:33,399
You been assigned to my case or something?

844
01:03:33,456 --> 01:03:35,979
Assigned? Willis, what are you talking about?

845
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:37,460
I'm your lawyer.

846
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:41,880
- I'm gonna need a lawyer?
- Everybody needs a lawyer.

847
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,994
Uh-uh-huh.

848
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:45,247
Listen, Willis.

849
01:03:45,301 --> 01:03:47,574
Did Cookie ever show you a copy of her will?

850
01:03:47,614 --> 01:03:49,534
I don't know anything about that.

851
01:03:49,653 --> 01:03:52,749
She had a cookie jar where she kept all of her...

852
01:03:52,883 --> 01:03:55,869
important papers and stuff like that. So, uh...

853
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:58,923
if she had a will, I reckon that's where it would be.

854
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:01,967
She had a will alright. I drew it up for her myself.

855
01:04:02,007 --> 01:04:03,303
I'm sorry, Willis.

856
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:06,663
We're gonna work this out quick. I promise.

857
01:04:07,037 --> 01:04:08,540
- Did you hear?
- What?

858
01:04:08,622 --> 01:04:11,653
Old Jessie hooked a 14 pounder large one.

859
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,133
- Lost it.
- No shit!

860
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,869
Hi, Emma. Welcome back to town.

861
01:04:18,922 --> 01:04:21,755
I don't suppose you came back
to pay those parking tickets now?

862
01:04:21,794 --> 01:04:23,796
Um, well, I was gonna talk to you about that.

863
01:04:23,823 --> 01:04:25,041
- But...
- What happened to your face?

864
01:04:25,068 --> 01:04:28,085
Nothing. Mainly, I'm here to bring this shirt to Willis.

865
01:04:28,146 --> 01:04:31,864
D on the double is 13. Read 'em and weep.

866
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:36,262
- Ah, go ahead, Lester.
- Jack, pass that letter, will you?

867
01:04:36,402 --> 01:04:38,392
Okay, I'm taking the last two here.

868
01:04:38,447 --> 01:04:40,692
Willis! I can't believe this.

869
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:42,772
I can not believe you're in the cell!

870
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:46,162
- Lester, what are you doing with Willis?
- Calm down, all right.

871
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,528
And you're playing Scrabble at a time like this?

872
01:04:48,575 --> 01:04:50,631
- Yes, we keep our minds occupied.
- Oh, yeah?

873
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,878
Yes, until somebody comes back here
and straightens this thing out.

874
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,808
- You got it, right Willis?
- I brought your shirt.

875
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,974
Yeah, everything's gonna be alright.

876
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,188
Well, as long as you got Willis is in this cell,

877
01:05:00,213 --> 01:05:03,213
you can just count me in too because I'm not leaving.

878
01:05:04,443 --> 01:05:06,536
They can't kick me out of here, can they?

879
01:05:06,576 --> 01:05:09,051
Well... That ought to work without the script.

880
01:05:09,115 --> 01:05:13,442
Well, if they try, we can just remind them
that I'm an actual criminal.

881
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:17,352
I've got 234 dollars-worth
of outstanding parking tickets.

882
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:19,139
That's a Marshall County record.

883
01:05:19,212 --> 01:05:22,085
Not to mention a few other things
they didn't catch me for.

884
01:05:22,132 --> 01:05:23,675
And I've been on the lam.

885
01:05:23,702 --> 01:05:26,408
I'm a fugitive from justice. So, arrest me.

886
01:05:26,475 --> 01:05:29,648
- I knew I smelled catfish in here.
- Ha ha.

887
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:32,113
You all got a Coke machine around here?

888
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,833
Yeah, it's right down this hallway to the right. Hold on!

889
01:05:34,899 --> 01:05:36,802
Bring me another Dr Pepper.

890
01:05:36,862 --> 01:05:38,575
You're way behind.

891
01:05:59,681 --> 01:06:01,524
Go on in and find Lester.

892
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:05,457
Tell him investigator Tucker's due
over here any minute from Batesville.

893
01:06:07,983 --> 01:06:11,399
Leaving the damn lights on. Turn the damn lights off.

894
01:06:37,592 --> 01:06:39,947
Sorry about your Aunt Cookie.

895
01:06:40,775 --> 01:06:44,761
And about that stuff back there
with your Mom and your Aunt Camille.

896
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,436
Sorry about Willis.

897
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:49,143
I bet he didn't do it.

898
01:06:49,203 --> 01:06:50,266
Didn't do it?

899
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,666
Of course, he didn't do it. Jesus!

900
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:55,638
Put another notch on your gun for that one.

901
01:06:58,632 --> 01:07:03,608
Now, I got "demote" here. That's 3,7,9, that's 18.

902
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:06,265
- That's my original Scrabble.
- I've brought you some coffee, Willis.

903
01:07:06,305 --> 01:07:07,338
No, thanks.

904
01:07:07,385 --> 01:07:10,174
Oh, go ahead. Coffee is real good
for you in time of stress.

905
01:07:10,231 --> 01:07:13,001
- I don't want it.
- Yes, you do. It's the fresh pot.

906
01:07:13,048 --> 01:07:14,624
- Let's see what I got.
- Mmm!

907
01:07:14,678 --> 01:07:16,244
You, you're right, Emma.

908
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:19,091
I can use a little fresh coffee. Help clear my head.

909
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:24,701
Too bad Aunt Cookie can't be clearing her head tonight.

910
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,935
Right now, she'd be sitting there at the kitchen table

911
01:07:27,982 --> 01:07:29,741
smoking a pipe, wouldn't she?

912
01:07:30,023 --> 01:07:32,766
- Mrs Orcutt smoked a pipe?
- Oh, yeah.

913
01:07:32,842 --> 01:07:35,005
She had racks and racks of 'em all over the house.

914
01:07:35,045 --> 01:07:37,251
And there on the metal, and in the kitchen.

915
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:39,491
You know, them little dainty ones for ladies.

916
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:41,855
Mother and Aunt Camille hated it too, didn't they?

917
01:07:41,896 --> 01:07:42,903
Uh-huh.

918
01:07:42,955 --> 01:07:45,192
They thought it was a disgrace.

919
01:07:45,721 --> 01:07:47,705
Mainly Aunt Camille.

920
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,692
What an idiot she is!

921
01:07:49,852 --> 01:07:51,498
I got it.

922
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:56,261
C... E... that's ten.

923
01:07:56,335 --> 01:07:57,862
- What ten?
- What's that?

924
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,241
Look, look, look, look here, Lester.

925
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:03,067
What all did you say you found my fingerprints on?

926
01:08:03,115 --> 01:08:04,688
Because I can tell you right now...

927
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:07,027
I cleaned everyone of them guns last night,

928
01:08:07,075 --> 01:08:09,787
so, my prints must be on all of them all of them.

929
01:08:10,183 --> 01:08:11,812
Anybody see you clean them?

930
01:08:11,859 --> 01:08:14,032
- I did.
- You did not!

931
01:08:15,106 --> 01:08:18,093
And why would I smash a gun case that doesn't even lock?

932
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:21,849
- Latch doesn't even work.
- He's right. I've seen it a million times.

933
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:24,236
It sort os hangs there. A million times maybe even more.

934
01:08:24,276 --> 01:08:25,456
I've been meaning to fix it.

935
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:28,569
Willis, in your best interests, it'd be good idea just.

936
01:08:28,623 --> 01:08:30,358
- My best interests?
- To remains silent.

937
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:33,293
Hey, look here. My best interests
is right here sitting in this room,

938
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:34,459
ain't that right?

939
01:08:34,505 --> 01:08:35,810
What? Now, now look...

940
01:08:35,846 --> 01:08:39,768
What? The gun case latch doesn't work,
can't even lock it?

941
01:08:39,845 --> 01:08:40,965
No.

942
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:44,710
Eddie, the expert from Batesville, strikes again.

943
01:08:44,777 --> 01:08:48,321
What about the jewel box? Any prints on that?

944
01:08:48,427 --> 01:08:50,334
Only Mrs Orcutt's.

945
01:08:50,533 --> 01:08:53,233
You know what? I'd like to know
what she kept in that jewel box.

946
01:08:53,321 --> 01:08:57,957
Well, Miss Dixons says she had a valuable
diamond and ruby necklace in there.

947
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:04,673
Oh... Oh, Cookie had this one necklace
Buck had given her for Christmas.

948
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:07,471
Oh Buck, he got taken every time he turned around.

949
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:10,185
Buck was the biggest sucker ever lived.

950
01:09:10,468 --> 01:09:13,998
He won that necklace off somebody in a poker game.

951
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:17,828
It had a big old C on it. And he thought it was fate...

952
01:09:17,936 --> 01:09:21,382
as his wife's name was Cookie and all.

953
01:09:21,649 --> 01:09:24,359
He sneaked the thing out of the house one day.

954
01:09:24,444 --> 01:09:27,884
And I drove up with him to Memphis to get it value.

955
01:09:28,185 --> 01:09:29,963
And what do you know?

956
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:34,961
If that necklace weren't enough fake,
worth about 50 dollars!

957
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:38,948
- You're kidding?
- Buck, he never told Cookie though.

958
01:09:39,213 --> 01:09:44,076
And she died thinking,
he'd given her diamonds and rubies.

959
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,246
Ohh, wow, wow, wow, wow!

960
01:09:49,305 --> 01:09:53,026
We have a triple letter there, that's 12, that's 14...

961
01:09:53,065 --> 01:09:56,698
and that's A-W-E. Huh, I'm out, give it up.

962
01:09:56,903 --> 01:09:58,118
- Awe?
- Give it up. Come on.

963
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,164
- Awe?
- Come on.

964
01:09:59,191 --> 01:10:00,598
"Awe" is not a word!

965
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:03,128
Awe, Lester. Awe.

966
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,713
Derived from old Norse

967
01:10:04,766 --> 01:10:10,426
which goes back to the reconstructed
Indo-European base "agh".

968
01:10:10,942 --> 01:10:14,640
A mixture of reverence, fear, wonder.

969
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,421
Excuse me, folks. I don't mean to be interrupting.

970
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:20,801
But, is this story hour at the Rec. Centre?

971
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:22,840
Or is this supposed to be the sheriff's station?

972
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,207
I'm confused. Lester, who are all these people?

973
01:10:26,274 --> 01:10:28,445
I'm Jack Palmer, sir. Attorney at Law.

974
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:30,005
I represent Mr Richland here.

975
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:31,061
Uh-huh.

976
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,309
- I'm Emma Duvall, his cell mate.
- Uh-huh.

977
01:10:34,374 --> 01:10:38,557
And I'm Willis Richland. I guess I'm your suspect, sir.

978
01:10:38,584 --> 01:10:39,730
Uh-huh.

979
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,630
Nice hat you got there.

980
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:48,826
Our most dear gracious loving kind heavenly father...

981
01:10:48,887 --> 01:10:52,466
we thank you so much for seeing
us through yet another day.

982
01:10:52,808 --> 01:10:57,351
We thank you for the simple yet plentiful
bounty you've seen fit to bestow on us.

983
01:10:57,497 --> 01:11:00,084
Your ways are not always ours to understand.

984
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:01,969
But, we are comforted in knowing

985
01:11:02,029 --> 01:11:05,349
that all will be made clear to us in the end.

986
01:11:05,396 --> 01:11:06,475
Amen.

987
01:11:06,694 --> 01:11:12,041
We pray for strength to get through
these dark and difficult days.

988
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:15,766
We pray for Willis Richland.

989
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,399
May God rest his soul if
he committed this terrible crime.

990
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,461
And may God rest his soul if he didn't.

991
01:11:22,761 --> 01:11:24,681
We pray for Emma.

992
01:11:24,746 --> 01:11:30,666
We pray that some day she shapes up and sees the light.

993
01:11:30,993 --> 01:11:36,218
And abandon her shameful, disgraceful and common ways.

994
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:41,038
In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and savior.

995
01:11:41,287 --> 01:11:43,658
- Amen.
- Amen.

996
01:12:05,717 --> 01:12:07,277
Psss...

997
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:09,444
Emma!

998
01:12:11,338 --> 01:12:12,905
Emma!

999
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:38,346
- Wait for Mama.
- Let's go get some pie kids.

1000
01:13:38,659 --> 01:13:39,987
Come on.

1001
01:13:40,027 --> 01:13:41,867
- Marlene.
- Hello.

1002
01:13:49,779 --> 01:13:52,668
It seems like every Easter we get a downpour.

1003
01:13:52,912 --> 01:13:56,232
Irvin and I, we were just talking about
how, how brave you two have been

1004
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,072
in the face of this, this terrible tragedy.

1005
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:00,559
Yes. Hmm.

1006
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:04,047
Well, thank you. But, I think Aunt Jewel would want this.

1007
01:14:04,138 --> 01:14:06,236
Yeah. The show must go on.

1008
01:14:28,586 --> 01:14:31,996
- Who made this stuff?
- Lester's wife.

1009
01:14:34,256 --> 01:14:35,836
Thank you, Emma.

1010
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:38,583
- You want some tea?
- Uh-huh.

1011
01:14:43,108 --> 01:14:45,871
Jason! What are you doing here?

1012
01:14:45,972 --> 01:14:47,385
Nothing.

1013
01:14:47,517 --> 01:14:50,631
Well, Wanda's showing me how to run the front desk.

1014
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:52,132
Did you eat it?

1015
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:53,725
Yeah.

1016
01:14:53,994 --> 01:14:56,539
Want some seconds?

1017
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:02,035
Now, tell me why would they put a brave cop like yourself

1018
01:15:02,089 --> 01:15:04,462
up at the boring old front desk?

1019
01:15:04,716 --> 01:15:09,479
Well, Wanda's gonna be tied up tomorrow.
Something to do with "administration".

1020
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:10,839
Uh-huh.

1021
01:15:10,933 --> 01:15:14,629
That gives us the run of the place.
If you know what I mean.

1022
01:15:17,733 --> 01:15:19,616
You want a Coke?

1023
01:15:25,329 --> 01:15:29,724
Ms Dixons, uh what exactly do you do
with these church plays?

1024
01:15:30,012 --> 01:15:31,610
Just about everything.

1025
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,296
I do the casting...

1026
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:36,529
I create the set,
I coordinate in making of the costumes...

1027
01:15:36,583 --> 01:15:38,863
and, of course, I direct all the plays.

1028
01:15:38,949 --> 01:15:42,599
Now this Monday night, we're putting on a wonderful play.

1029
01:15:42,655 --> 01:15:44,832
Oh, it's called Salome and you all should come.

1030
01:15:44,879 --> 01:15:46,225
It's gonna be a real hit.

1031
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:48,989
I play Salome. And I get to dance.

1032
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:52,569
And ask King Herod for the head
of John, the Baptist, on a silver platter.

1033
01:15:52,622 --> 01:15:54,145
Boy, wait till you see that head.

1034
01:15:54,185 --> 01:15:56,985
It looks so real, the blood coming down the plate...

1035
01:15:57,034 --> 01:15:59,805
Well um, that sounds like
a great idea for an Easter play.

1036
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:04,501
I'm partial to Oscar Wilde's version.
Of course, I did revise it a little.

1037
01:16:04,621 --> 01:16:08,521
Sorry, we don't have any fruit salad. We broke the bowl.

1038
01:16:10,384 --> 01:16:13,462
Thank you for taking the time
to talk to us today, Mr. Johnson.

1039
01:16:13,623 --> 01:16:16,789
As you know, we're holding a man down
at the station on suspicion of murder

1040
01:16:16,843 --> 01:16:19,450
based on a whole lot of question marks. And...

1041
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:22,478
I'd like to get some answers
as soon as possible. You understand?

1042
01:16:22,532 --> 01:16:25,552
- Yeah, I understand.
- Hold it just a minute.

1043
01:16:25,654 --> 01:16:29,217
I almost forgot. Josie... uh...

1044
01:16:29,297 --> 01:16:31,657
Look, while we talking to Theo,
you gonna have to wear these.

1045
01:16:31,707 --> 01:16:33,154
This is strictly confidential.

1046
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,767
So, you can't hear any of this. So, put these on.

1047
01:16:37,043 --> 01:16:38,303
All right.

1048
01:16:38,528 --> 01:16:40,029
- Mr Johnson?
- Too loud?

1049
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:42,995
You promise to tell the truth, whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1050
01:16:43,036 --> 01:16:44,043
No, I don't.

1051
01:16:44,094 --> 01:16:46,717
- I sure do!
- Uh-huh. Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

1052
01:16:46,817 --> 01:16:48,737
Mr. Johnson, we mainly try to confirm.

1053
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:51,844
Mr Richland's account of his whereabouts on Saturday.

1054
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:55,911
Now, did Willis Richland, at any point
on that afternoon, come into the bar?

1055
01:16:55,985 --> 01:16:57,189
- Yeah, he did.
- Uh-huh.

1056
01:16:57,249 --> 01:16:59,069
Now, what time would that be?

1057
01:16:59,155 --> 01:17:01,571
About 1:30 thereabout.

1058
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,098
See there? Now that's exactly what Willis told you.

1059
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:06,795
He said he went out to run some errands
at around 1:30 in the afternoon.

1060
01:17:06,845 --> 01:17:10,341
- Everything the man had told you.
- Lester! Sit down.

1061
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,221
Wanda, strike Lester's statement, please.

1062
01:17:14,258 --> 01:17:17,154
Well, I can't exactly strike it because I'm recording it.

1063
01:17:17,188 --> 01:17:18,394
- Wanda.
- Not writing it down.

1064
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,528
- Wanda.
- But, when we get back to...

1065
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:22,740
I'd love to.

1066
01:17:24,493 --> 01:17:28,633
So, Mr. Johnson, you said Willis Richland
came into the bar at 1:30 that afternoon?

1067
01:17:28,673 --> 01:17:29,940
- That's right.
- Uh-huh.

1068
01:17:29,987 --> 01:17:32,316
Uh, did, did he stay for a while and have a drink?

1069
01:17:32,436 --> 01:17:34,890
- Uh, no. No, he didn't.
- Uh-huh.

1070
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:38,020
You see, Willis is a responsible man.

1071
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,066
Uh-huh.

1072
01:17:39,106 --> 01:17:40,793
- And he never...
- Uh-huh.

1073
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:43,237
- Never drinks...
- Uh-huh.

1074
01:17:43,588 --> 01:17:45,960
Before Tom Brokaw.

1075
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:54,983
Then what did he come in for?

1076
01:17:58,355 --> 01:17:59,963
Mr. Johnson?

1077
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,355
- Nothing but the truth, Mr. Johnson.
- Eddie.

1078
01:18:02,408 --> 01:18:04,768
- Wanda.
- I know: Strike Eddie.

1079
01:18:04,865 --> 01:18:08,568
Mr. Johnson? What did he come
to the bar that afternoon for?

1080
01:18:08,808 --> 01:18:10,015
Umm...

1081
01:18:11,141 --> 01:18:12,755
He came to return something.

1082
01:18:12,824 --> 01:18:14,738
What exactly did he come to return?

1083
01:18:14,804 --> 01:18:17,817
A half pint of Wild Turkey.

1084
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:20,619
- Wild Turkey?
- Wild Turkey.

1085
01:18:20,755 --> 01:18:25,099
Why would he be returning
a half pint of Wild Turkey to your bar?

1086
01:18:25,329 --> 01:18:29,149
Well, he took it the night before.

1087
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:30,533
Took it. What do you mean?

1088
01:18:30,587 --> 01:18:31,773
- Took it!
- Took it?

1089
01:18:31,806 --> 01:18:33,746
- Took it!
- Took it!

1090
01:18:33,819 --> 01:18:34,920
- Without asking?
- Took it.

1091
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,473
That's what I mean. Took it.

1092
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,083
- You mean he stole it?
- No.

1093
01:18:39,210 --> 01:18:40,230
No, no, no.

1094
01:18:40,286 --> 01:18:43,570
I think you misconstrued the matter. You see.

1095
01:18:43,832 --> 01:18:45,410
- He borrowed it.
- Uh-huh.

1096
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:49,831
But, he brought the bottle back full next day.

1097
01:18:49,911 --> 01:18:52,730
- Like he usually does.
- Ohhh.

1098
01:18:52,843 --> 01:18:55,539
So, you saying this ain't
the first time that Willis Richland

1099
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,653
took something from your bar without asking.

1100
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,273
Is that what you're saying Mr. Johnson?

1101
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:03,449
Well uh, uh, it, it, it's not like you think it is.

1102
01:19:03,856 --> 01:19:05,529
- Mr. Johnson.
- I'm trying to tell you...

1103
01:19:05,582 --> 01:19:07,156
- Mr Johnson.
- I...

1104
01:19:07,237 --> 01:19:10,440
Thank you for your time. You been very helpful.

1105
01:19:12,786 --> 01:19:16,182
Man, if the electric chair doesn't kill me...

1106
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:19,429
this jail food will.

1107
01:19:21,714 --> 01:19:24,270
Ain't no telling what my last meal's gonna be.

1108
01:19:24,371 --> 01:19:26,250
That's not funny.

1109
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,599
Willis, was your family as crazy as mine?

1110
01:19:29,975 --> 01:19:31,975
Yeah, some of them.

1111
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:35,931
Every family got a few loose screws here and there.

1112
01:19:36,525 --> 01:19:39,365
But, there's always some keepers too.

1113
01:19:39,737 --> 01:19:42,497
- You have a favourite relative?
- Oh, yeah.

1114
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:45,826
My granddaddy. Yes, sir.

1115
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:48,576
He's the one who taught me to fish.

1116
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:51,680
He used to take me to Possum Kingdom every summer.

1117
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:53,274
We camped out.

1118
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,933
I'd live all year for that one week.

1119
01:19:58,344 --> 01:20:02,603
You know, I was the youngest of his 34 grandkids.

1120
01:20:02,683 --> 01:20:04,243
34?

1121
01:20:04,352 --> 01:20:07,508
Isn't that something? One man, 34 grandkids.

1122
01:20:07,541 --> 01:20:09,402
How did they tell you all apart?

1123
01:20:09,462 --> 01:20:10,815
Well...

1124
01:20:11,236 --> 01:20:13,435
16 of them was girls...

1125
01:20:13,531 --> 01:20:15,405
18 boys. That helped.

1126
01:20:15,492 --> 01:20:19,552
And then 20 of us was black, the other 14 white.

1127
01:20:20,057 --> 01:20:21,604
What you mean white?

1128
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:23,810
White like you.

1129
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:26,091
How'd that happen?

1130
01:20:26,714 --> 01:20:30,097
My granddaddy was white.

1131
01:20:30,324 --> 01:20:31,363
My Gog!

1132
01:20:31,403 --> 01:20:36,653
Yeah, we was all mixed up colorwise,
but I came out the blackest.

1133
01:20:38,606 --> 01:20:39,919
Wow!

1134
01:20:40,691 --> 01:20:42,967
- Hi, y'all.
- Hey, there.

1135
01:20:43,611 --> 01:20:49,081
Wanda and them are still out,
so I thought I'd stop by and...

1136
01:20:49,187 --> 01:20:51,267
see if you wanted coffee or something?

1137
01:20:51,329 --> 01:20:53,079
Yeah, matter of fact, I do.

1138
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:57,185
Emma, uh, would you get it for me?
I sure do like the way you make my coffee.

1139
01:20:57,232 --> 01:20:59,379
Would you like a little cream in it this time?

1140
01:20:59,424 --> 01:21:01,680
Yeah, heavy on the cream.

1141
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:53,798
So, Miss... Miss Martin...

1142
01:21:54,216 --> 01:21:56,536
You can call me Josie.

1143
01:21:56,649 --> 01:21:59,703
Uh... J... Josie. Yeah.

1144
01:21:59,777 --> 01:22:00,903
Uh...

1145
01:22:01,297 --> 01:22:02,464
Josie...

1146
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:05,327
So, you say that Willis Richland...

1147
01:22:05,508 --> 01:22:09,860
came into the bar Saturday afternoon
while you were on duty...

1148
01:22:10,866 --> 01:22:14,562
Prox... Prox... Proximately,
what, what time would that be?

1149
01:22:14,802 --> 01:22:19,112
- Uh, I guess 2:30 or so.
- Uh-huh.

1150
01:22:19,178 --> 01:22:21,338
- I really can't remember.
- 2:30?

1151
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:24,219
Theo said 1:30. Looks like
we've got the discrepancy here already.

1152
01:22:24,265 --> 01:22:26,045
Eddie, if you say one more word...

1153
01:22:26,094 --> 01:22:27,207
Mister...

1154
01:22:27,286 --> 01:22:29,769
I don't know who the hell you think you are?

1155
01:22:29,836 --> 01:22:33,717
I was told that I only had to answer
to one investigator here.

1156
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:36,904
And I really don't appreciate your interruptions.

1157
01:22:37,049 --> 01:22:40,984
And I don't appreciate you messing
with my train of thought!

1158
01:22:41,054 --> 01:22:42,783
- And furthermore...
- Why do I have to listen to this?

1159
01:22:42,831 --> 01:22:45,470
How much time do you spend in a drinking establishment?

1160
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:47,837
- Ms Martin...
- My guess would be not much...

1161
01:22:48,105 --> 01:22:52,493
We folks of the nightlife don't spend
much time looking at a clock on the wall.

1162
01:22:52,569 --> 01:22:56,985
We do what we do best is drink and bury the blues.

1163
01:22:57,242 --> 01:23:01,098
- And wild women don't get the blues.
- Ha-ha, you got that right, sister.

1164
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:02,384
Wanda...

1165
01:23:03,265 --> 01:23:04,572
Oh, yes.

1166
01:23:10,092 --> 01:23:12,962
T... Ten minutes recess, please.

1167
01:23:18,976 --> 01:23:21,003
Cora, get your fingers out of there!

1168
01:23:21,146 --> 01:23:23,356
Keep this thing closed.

1169
01:23:23,651 --> 01:23:25,094
How unsociable!

1170
01:23:25,128 --> 01:23:27,228
All these guns just sitting right here in the foyer.

1171
01:23:27,274 --> 01:23:28,754
What'll we do with all these things?

1172
01:23:28,787 --> 01:23:31,201
- We could learn to shoot.
- Shoot? Shoot what?

1173
01:23:31,244 --> 01:23:34,434
You always said someone ought
to shoot old Jessie, didn't you?

1174
01:23:34,498 --> 01:23:36,526
That was a big big mouth in its day...

1175
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,772
Mr. Freeman, can you tell me approximately

1176
01:23:38,826 --> 01:23:41,193
what time Willis came into the store on Saturday?

1177
01:23:41,257 --> 01:23:43,027
- It was in the afternoon.
- Uh-huh.

1178
01:23:43,107 --> 01:23:44,700
About 1:30, I think.

1179
01:23:44,803 --> 01:23:47,113
He bought a half pint of Wild Turkey.

1180
01:23:47,174 --> 01:23:49,187
Half pint of Wild Turkey?

1181
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:53,815
Well, the same as Theo said: Wild Turkey.

1182
01:23:54,172 --> 01:23:56,578
- Daddy?
- Not now. Daddy's busy.

1183
01:23:56,652 --> 01:23:59,328
Now, did he specifically ask for Wild Turkey?

1184
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:00,421
Yes, sir.

1185
01:24:00,462 --> 01:24:01,962
Probably for Easter Sunday.

1186
01:24:02,388 --> 01:24:05,864
I sell almost as much Turkey
at Easter as I do at Thanksgiving.

1187
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:08,797
Get it? Turkey? Thanksgiving?

1188
01:24:08,865 --> 01:24:10,924
Ah-Ha... Whoa!

1189
01:24:12,879 --> 01:24:13,979
Thank you.

1190
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,438
Daddy, I saw something in Ms. Orcutt's yard.

1191
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,792
Now Ronnie, you got to stop interrupting us now.

1192
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:20,959
Whatever you got to tell me can wait.

1193
01:24:21,058 --> 01:24:23,021
Go outside and play.

1194
01:24:24,177 --> 01:24:25,297
Kids...

1195
01:24:25,473 --> 01:24:26,820
I like this room best.

1196
01:24:26,848 --> 01:24:28,700
I think facing East is good luck...

1197
01:24:28,754 --> 01:24:30,267
for the sunrise. Don't you?

1198
01:24:30,314 --> 01:24:33,790
But if you want this one, that's okay.
I can take this one instead.

1199
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:36,196
It has the best view of trees, the magnolia trees.

1200
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:39,270
Trees that bloom like the blasts
of trumpets heralding the approach of kings

1201
01:24:39,303 --> 01:24:40,643
and make afraid the enemy!

1202
01:24:40,703 --> 01:24:43,213
Now Cora, when you say: "make afraid the enemy",

1203
01:24:43,273 --> 01:24:46,546
you have to have in your head: "make the enemy afraid".

1204
01:24:46,586 --> 01:24:48,329
Because, unless you have that in your head,

1205
01:24:48,376 --> 01:24:51,649
the audience won't even want to know
what you're talking about.

1206
01:25:03,825 --> 01:25:06,350
Turn out stack of catfish here today.

1207
01:25:06,742 --> 01:25:08,458
Hey, Manny.

1208
01:25:09,214 --> 01:25:10,758
Hey, Billy.

1209
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:14,112
- You got a couple of minutes?
- Yes, sir.

1210
01:25:14,178 --> 01:25:15,212
Hey.

1211
01:25:15,453 --> 01:25:16,573
Hey, Lester.

1212
01:25:16,673 --> 01:25:20,140
Listen, my health department permit
that Frank Chapman framed...

1213
01:25:20,173 --> 01:25:22,714
I'm gonna try to get by there
this afternoon and pick it up.

1214
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:24,654
- Excuse me, uh... Mr. uh...
- Hood.

1215
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:26,291
- Mr. Hood.
- Manny Hood...

1216
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:29,840
Mr. Hood. Uh, I'm an investigator Tucker from Batesville.

1217
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:33,146
And we're not interested in any permit or anything. We...

1218
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:36,772
- We just want to ask you a few...
- Want to swear him in?

1219
01:25:36,812 --> 01:25:39,972
No, I don't want to swear him in, Eddie. Thank you.

1220
01:25:50,924 --> 01:25:53,167
- You get my coffee?
- Oh shit. I'm sorry, I forgot...

1221
01:25:53,218 --> 01:25:56,740
No, no, that's, that's all right.
It can wait, wait until later.

1222
01:25:58,559 --> 01:26:00,230
- You know what, Emma?
- What?

1223
01:26:00,269 --> 01:26:02,092
You don't smell much like catfish anymore.

1224
01:26:02,152 --> 01:26:04,952
For some reasons, you start to smell
more like that sweet crab salad.

1225
01:26:04,999 --> 01:26:06,152
Cookie used to make.

1226
01:26:06,192 --> 01:26:07,878
I'm gonna get your coffee.

1227
01:26:07,950 --> 01:26:09,837
I sterilise these pliers every half hour.

1228
01:26:09,862 --> 01:26:10,993
And that boxcar's over there,

1229
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:12,840
I'm getting it hooked up with
the electric company tomorrow.

1230
01:26:12,873 --> 01:26:14,966
Okay. Mr. Hood, tell me something.

1231
01:26:15,038 --> 01:26:19,974
Now, did Willis Richland ever come
on these premises this past Saturday?

1232
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,254
- Willis?
- Uh-huh.

1233
01:26:21,348 --> 01:26:23,568
He came by here. He was looking for Emma Duvall.

1234
01:26:23,633 --> 01:26:25,249
He did?

1235
01:26:25,903 --> 01:26:27,963
What time would that be?

1236
01:26:28,317 --> 01:26:30,123
1:30, maybe.

1237
01:26:31,803 --> 01:26:34,499
How is it possible that one man can be

1238
01:26:34,532 --> 01:26:38,246
at so many different places at the exact same time?

1239
01:26:59,046 --> 01:27:00,521
I never like this chair in the den.

1240
01:27:00,554 --> 01:27:02,207
I always thought she's gonna sit the room.

1241
01:27:02,234 --> 01:27:03,254
Camille. Um...

1242
01:27:03,287 --> 01:27:04,434
- Camille.
- Hold, hold.

1243
01:27:04,487 --> 01:27:05,501
Oh, Jack.

1244
01:27:05,534 --> 01:27:07,061
- I tried to tell you.
- You scared me.

1245
01:27:07,105 --> 01:27:09,135
- Sorry. Not my intention.
- Come on, Cora.

1246
01:27:09,168 --> 01:27:11,341
What's all this? You wouldn't
be spring-cleaning, would you?

1247
01:27:11,374 --> 01:27:13,837
Oh, no. We are turning this place upside-down.

1248
01:27:13,884 --> 01:27:16,724
Um, Camille said that Aunt Jewel
had the worst sense of style

1249
01:27:16,757 --> 01:27:18,366
in rich in space and motif.

1250
01:27:18,413 --> 01:27:22,046
Cora, we're just reorganising
a few things, tidying up a bit.

1251
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:24,173
I thought the place was still a crime scene.

1252
01:27:24,213 --> 01:27:27,674
Sheriff Cox sees this.
He's awful picky about his yellow tape.

1253
01:27:27,714 --> 01:27:31,670
Well, Jack. The police have already
had their fair share of time here.

1254
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:34,430
So, if you don't mind,
Cora and I still have a lot of work to do

1255
01:27:34,464 --> 01:27:35,703
before we have to get over to the church.

1256
01:27:35,742 --> 01:27:37,789
We are putting on a play tonight, remember?

1257
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:39,556
No sweat. I'll be out of here in no time.

1258
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:44,042
I just dropped by to pick up
the original copy of Ms. Orcutt's will.

1259
01:27:44,282 --> 01:27:46,955
Will? What will?

1260
01:27:47,016 --> 01:27:49,342
It's in the cookie jar.

1261
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:03,483
Jack, I don't think you're gonna find anything here.

1262
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:06,223
Aunt Jewel didn't even have
a cookie jar that I can remember.

1263
01:28:06,262 --> 01:28:09,158
Oh yes she did. It's in that top cupboard up there.

1264
01:28:09,218 --> 01:28:13,742
Camille said it was so ugly, it should
be somewhere so no-one had to look at it.

1265
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:16,461
- Well thank you, Cora.
- You're welcome.

1266
01:28:16,535 --> 01:28:17,755
Cora?

1267
01:28:17,888 --> 01:28:20,401
Listen. Why don't you just go out the front porch

1268
01:28:20,455 --> 01:28:22,142
to practice some dance steps.

1269
01:28:22,202 --> 01:28:25,125
The play's in four hours.
You haven't got the fifth veil right.

1270
01:28:25,152 --> 01:28:26,933
Why don't you just go out there and practice.

1271
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:28,265
Okay.

1272
01:28:35,301 --> 01:28:36,321
Oh, here we are.

1273
01:28:36,355 --> 01:28:38,049
Jack, is that what you were looking for?

1274
01:28:38,097 --> 01:28:39,853
Not to worry. I'll read it out loud

1275
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:42,120
just as soon as I get everybody in the same room.

1276
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,769
- Who's everybody?
- See you in Galilee!

1277
01:28:46,345 --> 01:28:48,157
Damn! A will!

1278
01:28:48,191 --> 01:28:50,944
I can't believe it. Why didn't I look in here?

1279
01:28:51,011 --> 01:28:52,264
What else she put in here?

1280
01:28:52,344 --> 01:28:54,040
Camille! We've got company.

1281
01:28:54,087 --> 01:28:55,600
This man's looking for his tape.

1282
01:28:55,654 --> 01:28:56,677
Come on in fellows.

1283
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:59,064
I think I left a bunch of it in the washing machine.

1284
01:28:59,137 --> 01:29:01,410
Oh, my God! That's it.

1285
01:29:03,975 --> 01:29:05,322
Hhh-Hhh!

1286
01:29:05,629 --> 01:29:09,348
Batesville is B.A.T.E, not B.A.I.T.

1287
01:29:09,586 --> 01:29:11,520
I tell you what?

1288
01:29:11,586 --> 01:29:14,539
If I find Miss Dixon over at that house again,

1289
01:29:14,613 --> 01:29:16,719
I'm gonna tape my cattle prod to her.

1290
01:29:16,775 --> 01:29:19,019
Hay, guys. You just missed Batesville.

1291
01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:20,805
- They called a minute ago.
- Wait, wait till you hear this one.

1292
01:29:20,845 --> 01:29:23,231
There, there were two types of blood
on the gun. Not one, two.

1293
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:25,064
They, they found a whole bunch of O-positive,

1294
01:29:25,104 --> 01:29:27,444
you know, which is the most
common type of blood. All right.

1295
01:29:27,494 --> 01:29:30,017
But then, they found a second type too, ok?

1296
01:29:30,123 --> 01:29:31,451
You ready for this?

1297
01:29:31,541 --> 01:29:33,821
Traces of ABC negative.

1298
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:36,391
- ABC?
- He means AB negative, sir.

1299
01:29:36,444 --> 01:29:38,434
That's what I said, AB negative.
It's like the least common type.

1300
01:29:38,474 --> 01:29:40,754
It's rare. It's like hardly anyone alive with it.

1301
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,363
And they found more of it on the broken fruit salad bowl.

1302
01:29:44,943 --> 01:29:46,529
Son...

1303
01:29:46,948 --> 01:29:48,615
When does your play start?

1304
01:29:48,730 --> 01:29:50,922
Geez, I almost forget. Shoot, I have to go.

1305
01:29:51,042 --> 01:29:52,788
- You guys do without me?
- We'll manage.

1306
01:29:52,836 --> 01:29:54,272
- Get out.
- All right.

1307
01:29:54,312 --> 01:29:55,332
Break an arm.

1308
01:29:55,379 --> 01:29:57,052
What you doing? You'd better get down to the church.

1309
01:29:57,097 --> 01:29:58,857
I'll be there in a minute.

1310
01:29:59,077 --> 01:30:02,277
My son, he really did see something.

1311
01:30:02,665 --> 01:30:05,585
Ronnie, you want to tell these guys what you told me.

1312
01:30:05,961 --> 01:30:07,967
Hurry up, Cora. We're gonna be late again!

1313
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:09,820
There's already a couple of cars over there!

1314
01:30:09,887 --> 01:30:12,603
Camille, did my veils come back from the cleaners?

1315
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:15,083
Yeah, I told you. Marlene picked them up!

1316
01:30:21,689 --> 01:30:24,785
Ms. Orcutt's blood type is O-positive.

1317
01:30:24,826 --> 01:30:27,913
They're checking the medical record for Willis' type now.

1318
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,892
Then they say they're gonna go through the whole family.

1319
01:30:31,258 --> 01:30:35,298
ABCDEFG. They don't have it.

1320
01:30:35,707 --> 01:30:39,604
I bet the family of Willis Richland
doesn't have AB-negative blood.

1321
01:30:39,879 --> 01:30:46,079
- And just how do you know that?
- Cos I fished with him.

1322
01:30:46,183 --> 01:30:47,503
Suffer me to kiss thy mouth.

1323
01:30:47,546 --> 01:30:50,446
Never, I embrace the law of God.

1324
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:53,193
Suffer me to kiss thy mouth! Suffer me to kiss thy mouth!

1325
01:30:53,219 --> 01:30:55,398
But Salome, what about me?

1326
01:30:55,691 --> 01:30:58,049
Never, daughter of adultery! Never!

1327
01:30:58,082 --> 01:31:00,725
Suffer me to kiss thy mouth!

1328
01:31:26,851 --> 01:31:28,882
Turn off your blues, man. You don't need 'em.

1329
01:31:28,907 --> 01:31:30,184
- I can't turn 'em off.
- Ah, don't matter.

1330
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:33,154
- Just shut the whole thing off.
- It kills the engine...

1331
01:31:33,207 --> 01:31:35,247
I'm getting my coffee break here.

1332
01:31:43,044 --> 01:31:48,227
O there thou art, fair Salome! I have been seeking thee.

1333
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:51,500
Well stop seeking her a husband, damn it!

1334
01:31:51,597 --> 01:31:53,475
She is my daughter!

1335
01:31:53,569 --> 01:31:56,816
Daughter of the wanton one! The harlot!

1336
01:31:56,895 --> 01:31:58,638
Bid him be silent!

1337
01:31:58,678 --> 01:32:01,137
Wherefore is this blood here?

1338
01:32:01,332 --> 01:32:03,096
Whose body is this?

1339
01:32:03,163 --> 01:32:06,389
Our captain, sire. He slew himself.

1340
01:32:06,516 --> 01:32:07,643
Aye.

1341
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:11,476
I thought none but Roman philosophers slew themselves.

1342
01:32:11,523 --> 01:32:13,783
The Stoics do it too, sire.

1343
01:32:13,967 --> 01:32:18,660
- They are ridiculous people.
- Yes, it is ridiculous to kill oneself.

1344
01:32:18,744 --> 01:32:20,840
Bear him away.

1345
01:32:22,318 --> 01:32:25,558
Dance for me, Salome. I pray thee.

1346
01:32:25,598 --> 01:32:29,185
Dance the dance of the seven veils for me.

1347
01:32:29,229 --> 01:32:33,739
I have no desire to dance my king. I am of no mood.

1348
01:32:33,838 --> 01:32:37,072
Dance for me, and thou may ask of me...

1349
01:32:37,155 --> 01:32:42,514
anything thou pleases.
Anything up to half of all my kingdom!

1350
01:32:42,689 --> 01:32:44,226
Wait a minute!

1351
01:32:44,516 --> 01:32:46,119
Do I hear right, my king?

1352
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:49,866
You will give me anything I desire
if I would dance for you?

1353
01:32:49,926 --> 01:32:51,376
- No!
- Yes!

1354
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:52,911
Sworn an oath.

1355
01:32:53,012 --> 01:32:55,011
Camille, the veil! The veil!

1356
01:32:55,817 --> 01:32:57,164
So, be it.

1357
01:32:57,691 --> 01:33:01,184
I will dance for you.

1358
01:33:17,748 --> 01:33:21,390
Is all this stuff used in the play?
Is this Ms Dixon's purse?

1359
01:33:21,466 --> 01:33:23,750
Where's Ms. Dixon?

1360
01:33:37,233 --> 01:33:39,836
Why don't you go have a seat in the front?

1361
01:33:39,903 --> 01:33:42,216
I'll fix you a row at the front, okay?

1362
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,415
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.

1363
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,869
Wonder if Jason's killed himself over mother yet.

1364
01:33:53,056 --> 01:33:57,284
He said that he's playing this young Syrian
soldier who is in love with a princess,

1365
01:33:57,317 --> 01:33:59,384
who just happens to be my mother and well...

1366
01:33:59,428 --> 01:34:02,351
she ignores him and so he stabbed himself in the heart.

1367
01:34:02,432 --> 01:34:03,580
Oh, poor Jason.

1368
01:34:03,634 --> 01:34:06,371
Serves him right. Sniffing up the wrong tree.

1369
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:08,358
It's just acting, Emma.

1370
01:34:08,558 --> 01:34:10,891
I bet he's good in that death scene.

1371
01:34:11,051 --> 01:34:14,611
Maybe, he knows what it's like
to feel that way about a woman.

1372
01:34:14,698 --> 01:34:18,974
I know what it's like to feel that way about a man.

1373
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:55,544
Ohh.

1374
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:01,010
Most wonderful Salome!

1375
01:35:01,091 --> 01:35:04,467
Speak to me that I may give thee a royal fee.

1376
01:35:04,548 --> 01:35:07,375
On a silver platter, my king?

1377
01:35:07,734 --> 01:35:09,801
On a silver platter?

1378
01:35:09,936 --> 01:35:14,786
And what was thou desire on
this silver platter, my sweet and fair?

1379
01:35:14,859 --> 01:35:17,672
I want... I want...

1380
01:35:17,758 --> 01:35:20,508
I want the head of John.

1381
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:21,874
- Ms. Dixon.
- The Baptist.

1382
01:35:21,921 --> 01:35:23,794
- Yes!
- No!

1383
01:35:23,881 --> 01:35:29,984
You want the head of Willis Richland
in a cut glass fruit salad bowl.

1384
01:35:30,379 --> 01:35:34,628
No, no. That's not what thou dost desire.

1385
01:35:34,748 --> 01:35:38,867
Suffer me to render this unto you. I have news.

1386
01:35:38,921 --> 01:35:40,457
It's good. It's bad!

1387
01:35:41,471 --> 01:35:43,551
There's nothing common about you, Ms Dixon.

1388
01:35:43,591 --> 01:35:44,804
Ah-ah, very rare.

1389
01:35:44,856 --> 01:35:47,299
You have AB negative blood.

1390
01:35:47,872 --> 01:35:49,086
One of a few.

1391
01:35:49,139 --> 01:35:51,006
For the head of the Baptist.

1392
01:35:51,314 --> 01:35:54,368
And this means that we're gonna
have to take you down to the station.

1393
01:35:54,451 --> 01:35:58,060
We're gonna have to detained you
on suspicion of murder...

1394
01:35:58,174 --> 01:36:00,581
of Ms. Jewel Mae Cookie Orcutt.

1395
01:36:00,634 --> 01:36:02,162
- Oh Lester...
- Yes.

1396
01:36:03,802 --> 01:36:05,682
Ask of me anything.

1397
01:36:07,185 --> 01:36:09,185
One other piece of news, you know,

1398
01:36:09,232 --> 01:36:12,966
I'm willing to bet you that Willis
is willing to let you keep this.

1399
01:36:13,006 --> 01:36:15,200
- Come on, ma'am. Come on, ma'am.
- Oh, oh, Aunt Jewel Mae gave it to me.

1400
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:16,409
- No, I can't.
- You have to come with us now.

1401
01:36:16,456 --> 01:36:18,460
My play is still on stage. No, they can't...

1402
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:23,945
The head of the Baptist, and I want it now.

1403
01:36:28,245 --> 01:36:30,490
Is that you, Lester? Is that your cologne?

1404
01:36:30,581 --> 01:36:33,702
I don't know, Ms Dixon.
Ms. Dixon, when we get in the car...

1405
01:36:33,749 --> 01:36:36,716
Does your wife approve of this? Bet she buys it.

1406
01:36:36,762 --> 01:36:39,632
I got it. Just slide in, ma'am. Watch your head.

1407
01:36:39,732 --> 01:36:41,365
- Lester, keep her quiet.
- Yes, sir.

1408
01:36:41,405 --> 01:36:43,392
- I'll see you over there.
- All right.

1409
01:36:43,927 --> 01:36:45,767
- Eddie!
- All right, settle back down, please.

1410
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:47,920
Lester, can I come?

1411
01:36:48,047 --> 01:36:49,600
You got to give us some space.

1412
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:51,217
Hold on, Edmond. I'm coming with you guys.

1413
01:36:51,267 --> 01:36:53,100
No, you're not. Get out of here.

1414
01:36:53,153 --> 01:36:55,347
We don't even know you. Who are you?

1415
01:36:56,027 --> 01:36:58,256
She's AB negative, you know.

1416
01:37:01,287 --> 01:37:03,176
Does anybody know anything?

1417
01:37:03,264 --> 01:37:04,359
Come on back.

1418
01:37:06,112 --> 01:37:07,799
Again, she's not a director.

1419
01:37:14,446 --> 01:37:17,339
They're bringing in your Aunt Camille. She's AB negative.

1420
01:37:17,391 --> 01:37:19,567
- What does that mean?
- She's got negative blood!

1421
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:21,534
- Negative blood?
- AB.

1422
01:37:21,588 --> 01:37:22,821
Wow!

1423
01:37:44,136 --> 01:37:46,092
Right this way, Ms. Dixon.

1424
01:37:46,681 --> 01:37:48,212
Straight ahead.

1425
01:37:53,501 --> 01:37:55,131
This way, Ms. Dixon.

1426
01:37:55,797 --> 01:37:58,270
- I can't.
- Right through here, ma'am.

1427
01:38:04,661 --> 01:38:07,844
Ms. Dixon, you have a right to make a phone call.

1428
01:38:07,915 --> 01:38:11,564
Make it short if you will.
I am not sure about the battery.

1429
01:38:11,626 --> 01:38:13,293
May I please have some privacy?

1430
01:38:13,339 --> 01:38:16,895
If you wait about 5 minutes,
you'll have all the privacy you want.

1431
01:38:17,202 --> 01:38:19,698
We're fixing to release these two as I speak.

1432
01:38:19,765 --> 01:38:22,625
All right. We're alright!

1433
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:24,725
If you all come on out front,

1434
01:38:24,786 --> 01:38:27,525
we'll start getting this paperwork out of the way.

1435
01:38:35,285 --> 01:38:37,933
Pick up the phone, Cora.

1436
01:38:39,463 --> 01:38:42,616
That ring, it means you should pick it up.

1437
01:38:43,883 --> 01:38:45,829
- Billy.
- Jack.

1438
01:38:52,001 --> 01:38:54,790
- I thought you slew yourself.
- Oh, Jack.

1439
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:56,403
I'm trying to call Cora,

1440
01:38:56,437 --> 01:38:57,970
- she's not picking up the phone.
- Keep calm, Camille.

1441
01:38:58,010 --> 01:39:01,563
Lester, I need to confer with my client.

1442
01:39:03,289 --> 01:39:05,232
Sit down, Camille.

1443
01:39:05,398 --> 01:39:06,845
Listen, uh...

1444
01:39:07,012 --> 01:39:10,032
If it's all right with you guys, since
I've got everybody here in one place,

1445
01:39:10,078 --> 01:39:13,574
I'd like to make an announcement.
That is, if I'm not interrupting anything.

1446
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:16,068
No, not at all. Go ahead.

1447
01:39:17,147 --> 01:39:21,286
What I have here is the original document...

1448
01:39:21,399 --> 01:39:24,875
duty signed and witnessed, it is Ms. Orcutt's will.

1449
01:39:25,069 --> 01:39:27,199
And I'd like to read it.

1450
01:39:27,859 --> 01:39:30,172
It should be a scroll, I guess.

1451
01:39:30,459 --> 01:39:31,999
Sorry about that.

1452
01:39:32,774 --> 01:39:36,774
Last will and testament and it says, I quote...

1453
01:39:36,987 --> 01:39:39,120
The entire estate...

1454
01:39:39,186 --> 01:39:43,980
of Joseph Ray Buck Orcutt and Jewel Mae Cookie Orcutt...

1455
01:39:44,331 --> 01:39:47,501
is here by willed to the closest living relative.

1456
01:39:47,543 --> 01:39:48,994
Of course it is. I knew it.

1457
01:39:49,034 --> 01:39:51,027
I knew it. I told you, Billy. I told you.

1458
01:39:51,090 --> 01:39:57,020
To the closest living relative
of Joseph Ray Buck Orcutt...

1459
01:39:57,066 --> 01:39:59,253
- his nephew.
- Nephew?

1460
01:39:59,684 --> 01:40:02,927
His nephew. Willis Richland.

1461
01:40:05,153 --> 01:40:07,680
- Willis?
- Unquote.

1462
01:40:09,043 --> 01:40:10,503
Willis?

1463
01:40:11,525 --> 01:40:13,076
Yes, of course.

1464
01:40:13,243 --> 01:40:19,903
Well, we would never, never
ask you to give up your place, Willis.

1465
01:40:20,094 --> 01:40:23,894
No, our... I mean, Aunt Jewel's estate
just wouldn't be the same without you.

1466
01:40:24,088 --> 01:40:28,904
So, you mustn't think for a minute that
Cora and I would want it any other way.

1467
01:40:29,013 --> 01:40:30,803
- May I please see the will, Jack?
- Willis?

1468
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:32,976
- Thank you.
- This for a real?

1469
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:37,866
- You're, you're kin to me?
- Yeah, yeah, sort of...

1470
01:40:37,946 --> 01:40:40,646
- Your granddaddy? The white guy?
- And here, it is her signature...

1471
01:40:40,695 --> 01:40:44,065
Yeah. Uh, he was Buck's daddy.

1472
01:40:44,241 --> 01:40:47,398
Buck and Momma was sister and brother.

1473
01:40:47,438 --> 01:40:48,478
Thank you.

1474
01:40:48,525 --> 01:40:50,588
Oh, it's so great.

1475
01:40:50,748 --> 01:40:52,915
So you and I, we're like cousins or something?

1476
01:40:52,955 --> 01:40:54,188
Yeah.

1477
01:40:54,296 --> 01:40:56,695
Which means I'm part black?

1478
01:40:57,133 --> 01:40:59,143
Well, not really, Emma.

1479
01:40:59,203 --> 01:41:02,263
Since, I'm from Buck's side of the family, see?

1480
01:41:02,359 --> 01:41:04,252
- My Daddy dies in a...
- So who witnessed this?

1481
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:07,715
- Patrol the land...
- Old Jessie and Tucker Trace.

1482
01:41:07,756 --> 01:41:09,302
- In a Bomark.
- Trick-or-treat.

1483
01:41:09,369 --> 01:41:13,178
And uh my Mama, she couldn't
support us without him. So...

1484
01:41:13,285 --> 01:41:19,011
Well Buck, he sent for me and
I've been up here ever since.

1485
01:41:19,281 --> 01:41:22,984
And I think it's time everybody know this.

1486
01:41:23,267 --> 01:41:25,515
Oh, this is the best thing that ever happens to me.

1487
01:41:25,542 --> 01:41:27,634
Hey, Brutus, you're out of uniform.

1488
01:41:29,382 --> 01:41:32,145
Well, there you have it.

1489
01:41:32,785 --> 01:41:34,925
There you have it.

1490
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:40,009
Willis, cross my heart.

1491
01:41:40,592 --> 01:41:43,849
- I wish I could take it all back.
- I know.

1492
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:48,318
Well, this was the easy part. Now starts the hard part.

1493
01:41:49,522 --> 01:41:51,912
I gotta go home...

1494
01:41:52,132 --> 01:41:55,525
and face that big old house all alone.

1495
01:41:55,912 --> 01:41:57,245
But, no Cookie.

1496
01:41:57,461 --> 01:41:58,937
You got me.

1497
01:41:59,117 --> 01:42:00,918
Yeah, I know.

1498
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:03,151
Well...

1499
01:42:03,483 --> 01:42:05,331
If anybody's hungry...

1500
01:42:05,839 --> 01:42:08,932
live got stuff at home for catfish enchiladas.

1501
01:42:09,268 --> 01:42:10,957
- Scrabble!
- Fine with me.

1502
01:42:10,996 --> 01:42:15,804
H... Hold on a minute. Mr. Tucker.
We just got some here from Batesville.

1503
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:17,390
It says: Urgent.

1504
01:42:17,428 --> 01:42:19,734
- Let me have it.
- Please, be aware...

1505
01:42:19,823 --> 01:42:23,943
of the following information we found
in Camille Dixon's medical records.

1506
01:42:23,997 --> 01:42:25,864
- Give me here.
- In checking for blood types,

1507
01:42:25,891 --> 01:42:28,381
we discovered she had a condition...

1508
01:42:28,447 --> 01:42:31,261
Yeah, I'll tell you what her condition is. She's nuts.

1509
01:42:31,453 --> 01:42:33,108
What you doing, ABC?

1510
01:42:33,174 --> 01:42:34,422
Go on.

1511
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:39,788
A condition which under certain situation
of extreme stress, her blood won't clot.

1512
01:42:40,147 --> 01:42:43,173
If she injures herself, she could bleed to death.

1513
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:46,330
Please take necessary precautions.

1514
01:42:46,906 --> 01:42:51,136
- Emma, is Ms. Dixon your aunt?
- Unfortunately.

1515
01:42:51,234 --> 01:42:53,581
You ever see her suffer from this kind of condition here?

1516
01:42:53,635 --> 01:42:55,542
Unfortunately not.

1517
01:42:56,445 --> 01:43:00,658
Well, this paper here says that
she almost died giving birth.

1518
01:43:01,052 --> 01:43:02,618
- Birth?
- Uh-huh.

1519
01:43:02,708 --> 01:43:05,034
- Aunt Camille?
- Uh-huh.

1520
01:43:05,587 --> 01:43:08,746
Well, that's impossible, cos
she's never even gotten laid!

1521
01:43:08,819 --> 01:43:10,726
- Hhh!
- Really?

1522
01:43:11,070 --> 01:43:14,583
You mean, you ain't got a cousin somewhere?

1523
01:43:14,957 --> 01:43:17,376
Just Willis, as far as I know.

1524
01:43:19,005 --> 01:43:20,834
That's interesting.

1525
01:43:21,474 --> 01:43:24,568
These official insurance company records say that...

1526
01:43:24,718 --> 01:43:28,270
Camille Dixon gave birth in New Orleans Memorial Hospital

1527
01:43:29,091 --> 01:43:32,451
and had there a massive blood
transfusion to save everybody.

1528
01:43:32,643 --> 01:43:36,683
Her sister, Cora Dixon Duvall was the donor.

1529
01:43:37,021 --> 01:43:39,211
I guess that was Camille's lucky day.

1530
01:43:39,431 --> 01:43:42,271
April 1, 1979.

1531
01:43:45,308 --> 01:43:48,297
- What's wrong?
- Emma, what's wrong?

1532
01:43:49,915 --> 01:43:52,257
That's my birthday.

1533
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:47,614
- My uncle is my daddy?
- Well, uh...

1534
01:44:47,763 --> 01:44:50,780
So, for, for the past 20 years
his missing guy has been my daddy.

1535
01:44:50,842 --> 01:44:52,698
And then for the last twelve hours

1536
01:44:52,745 --> 01:44:55,332
he was my uncle and now he's my daddy again?

1537
01:44:55,410 --> 01:44:56,970
I'm afraid so, Emma.

1538
01:44:57,303 --> 01:45:00,575
Cora's husband, Donny, he was your father.

1539
01:45:01,095 --> 01:45:04,375
- Willis, did you know anything about this?
- No, I didn't.

1540
01:45:04,452 --> 01:45:06,875
I honestly don't believe anybody knew but me.

1541
01:45:06,955 --> 01:45:09,175
I'm sorry, I just couldn't tell you earlier.

1542
01:45:09,222 --> 01:45:11,568
Curse of a one-lawyer town, I guess.

1543
01:45:11,661 --> 01:45:15,131
- So, you found another place to stay?
- Yeah, Manny. With me.

1544
01:45:15,211 --> 01:45:18,157
You know, I can always put you up
in the big house if you don't like this.

1545
01:45:18,219 --> 01:45:21,529
So Jack, then tell me exactly how this happened.

1546
01:45:21,782 --> 01:45:23,678
Well, old Donny...

1547
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:26,372
he was a good-looking hunk, but...

1548
01:45:26,478 --> 01:45:28,932
he was not much of a provider, to say the least.

1549
01:45:29,067 --> 01:45:32,043
So, he and Cora moved in with Camille
right after they were married, and...

1550
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:34,243
Camille ended up taking care of both of them.

1551
01:45:34,323 --> 01:45:37,277
I guess, there were times that got
pretty tight in that little house.

1552
01:45:37,327 --> 01:45:39,403
Boy, I bet that's right.

1553
01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:42,870
Of course, nobody knows what happened
behind those walls, not even me.

1554
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,843
But a few months later,
old Donny just up and disappeared.

1555
01:45:47,096 --> 01:45:50,886
And shortly thereafter,
Cora and Camille leave town on an...

1556
01:45:50,966 --> 01:45:53,252
extended vacation.

1557
01:45:53,369 --> 01:45:57,959
And when they got back, little Emma belonged to Cora.

1558
01:45:58,185 --> 01:45:59,985
What do you mean "disappeared"?

1559
01:46:00,107 --> 01:46:03,410
I was told that, that, that he,
he went to Africa on a church mission

1560
01:46:03,457 --> 01:46:06,430
and gave his life saving children during the famine.

1561
01:46:06,530 --> 01:46:08,573
Well, not exactly what happened.

1562
01:46:08,622 --> 01:46:12,226
He died all right about four years later
somewhere down in Alabama.

1563
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:14,490
In a button factory accident.

1564
01:46:14,536 --> 01:46:16,457
- The button factory?
- Yep.

1565
01:46:16,525 --> 01:46:19,572
Seems the hole poker machine broke loose and fell on him.

1566
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:23,772
They said he had 273 holes in him
before they could get it off him.

1567
01:46:24,346 --> 01:46:25,922
- Willis?
- Huh?

1568
01:46:25,983 --> 01:46:28,562
What's wrong with all these people?

1569
01:46:28,614 --> 01:46:31,929
Pride, officer. Family pride.

1570
01:46:32,028 --> 01:46:36,944
My Aunt Jewel had a lot of pride,
and she was a very proud woman.

1571
01:46:36,987 --> 01:46:38,386
So, yes.

1572
01:46:38,453 --> 01:46:41,106
That is why I tried to cover up her suicide.

1573
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:45,090
To save her the embarrassment of it.
I feel she would have wanted that.

1574
01:46:45,236 --> 01:46:47,965
I see, I see. Let me try to understand this.

1575
01:46:48,031 --> 01:46:51,419
So, you went to Ms. Orcutt's house Saturday afternoon

1576
01:46:51,466 --> 01:46:53,826
to borrow her fruit salad bowl for Easter dinner.

1577
01:46:53,884 --> 01:46:59,020
Well actually, to, to get it back.
The bowl did belong to my mother, you see.

1578
01:46:59,113 --> 01:47:00,509
But, yes.

1579
01:47:00,596 --> 01:47:04,789
I went into the house and I couldn't find Aunt Jewel.

1580
01:47:04,836 --> 01:47:10,552
She didn't answer when I called out.
So I went upstairs to her bedroom...

1581
01:47:10,666 --> 01:47:15,863
and it's been that I found her on the bed
with a gun in a her hand.

1582
01:47:16,246 --> 01:47:20,282
And that's when you dropped
the fruit salad bowl and broke it.

1583
01:47:21,962 --> 01:47:26,938
Later downstairs, I cut my finger and
I used my hanky to stop the bleeding.

1584
01:47:27,058 --> 01:47:30,437
I guess I used the same hanky to take the gun.

1585
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:34,040
And that would explain why your blood was on the gun.

1586
01:47:34,290 --> 01:47:36,396
- Yes, sir.
- Uh-huh.

1587
01:47:36,564 --> 01:47:40,234
And then you went outside and
threw the gun into the bushes.

1588
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:41,981
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

1589
01:47:42,061 --> 01:47:47,377
Now Ms. Dixon, what would inspire you to do that?

1590
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:49,611
- Well...
- Uh-huh.

1591
01:47:49,697 --> 01:47:54,097
I have had extensive experience in theatre staging.

1592
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:55,803
Oh, of course.

1593
01:47:55,861 --> 01:48:00,244
I organically put myself in the shoes of the robber...

1594
01:48:00,477 --> 01:48:03,410
and then I just let the moment happened.

1595
01:48:03,517 --> 01:48:06,222
Did Cookie leave a suicide note?

1596
01:48:07,289 --> 01:48:09,167
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

1597
01:48:09,251 --> 01:48:12,285
Yes, she did. She left a note to Willis.

1598
01:48:12,442 --> 01:48:13,962
Where is it?

1599
01:48:14,445 --> 01:48:16,215
Well...

1600
01:48:17,281 --> 01:48:19,635
- I ate it.
- You what?

1601
01:48:19,675 --> 01:48:20,695
She ate it.

1602
01:48:20,735 --> 01:48:22,618
- She said what?
- She said she ate it.

1603
01:48:22,670 --> 01:48:24,185
- Ms. Duvall is on her way up.
- Cora!

1604
01:48:24,218 --> 01:48:26,734
Oh, my God. Cora! Cora!

1605
01:48:26,774 --> 01:48:27,781
- I've never seen that letter.
- - Inspector?

1606
01:48:27,808 --> 01:48:28,301
Yes, ma'am.

1607
01:48:28,326 --> 01:48:30,341
Inspector, my sister was there at the house with me.

1608
01:48:30,381 --> 01:48:32,496
She saw everything. She can back me up.

1609
01:48:32,549 --> 01:48:34,489
I swear. Mr. Tucker?

1610
01:48:35,869 --> 01:48:39,222
Let us know if you pass that suicide note, okay?

1611
01:48:39,824 --> 01:48:42,437
Your sister says your Aunt Jewel shot herself.

1612
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:43,524
Oh, no, officer.

1613
01:48:43,570 --> 01:48:45,070
My Aunt Jewel didn't shoot herself.

1614
01:48:45,104 --> 01:48:46,692
- Hey, Jason. How are you?
- She didn't.

1615
01:48:46,745 --> 01:48:49,068
No, sir, she did not shoot herself.

1616
01:48:49,141 --> 01:48:50,441
Well, didn't you have a gun?

1617
01:48:50,495 --> 01:48:52,248
Didn't you and your sister find a gun in her hand?

1618
01:48:52,288 --> 01:48:54,481
I, I never saw a gun in her hand, ever.

1619
01:48:54,543 --> 01:48:57,959
Well, what about a note?
I, I know she did leave a suicide note.

1620
01:48:58,002 --> 01:49:01,605
Oh no, there was no suicide note.
My Aunt Jewel did not commit suicide.

1621
01:49:01,659 --> 01:49:03,852
My Aunt Jewel was murdered.

1622
01:49:03,968 --> 01:49:05,901
- Can I have a Coke?
- Yes.

1623
01:49:05,974 --> 01:49:08,001
Oh well, you need... need a quarter here.

1624
01:49:08,067 --> 01:49:09,447
I got one.

1625
01:49:11,816 --> 01:49:13,938
Let me push that button.

1626
01:49:18,928 --> 01:49:22,088
You seem awful sure of yourself there Ms. Duvall.

1627
01:49:22,188 --> 01:49:27,164
I am positive, sir, as positive as
I ever been of anything in my entire life.

1628
01:49:27,257 --> 01:49:31,097
My Aunt Jewel was murdered. Just ask Camille.

1629
01:49:31,332 --> 01:49:32,876
She knows.

1630
01:49:33,469 --> 01:49:35,490
Where is she?

1631
01:49:35,836 --> 01:49:37,333
Right there.

1632
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:38,867
Cora?

1633
01:49:39,214 --> 01:49:40,827
Where have you been?

1634
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,587
I've been tried to call you all night all day.

1635
01:49:43,693 --> 01:49:45,040
Where were you?

1636
01:49:45,086 --> 01:49:48,456
Ohh, that was you. Silly me.

1637
01:49:48,589 --> 01:49:50,402
Why are you still dressed like that?

1638
01:49:50,496 --> 01:49:52,252
You had the key, I couldn't get in.

1639
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:53,546
Oh.

1640
01:49:55,052 --> 01:49:57,246
All right. So, okay.

1641
01:49:59,521 --> 01:50:03,084
Did you tell them? About Aunt Jewel?

1642
01:50:03,424 --> 01:50:04,724
Did you tell them what happened?

1643
01:50:04,751 --> 01:50:07,107
I told them the whole truth and nothing but.

1644
01:50:07,201 --> 01:50:08,621
Oh!

1645
01:50:11,127 --> 01:50:13,254
So, what did they say?

1646
01:50:13,417 --> 01:50:15,470
When are they gonna let me out of here?

1647
01:50:15,561 --> 01:50:17,877
I told them exactly how it happened.

1648
01:50:18,004 --> 01:50:20,751
Like you and me know how it happened.

1649
01:50:20,824 --> 01:50:22,217
Remember?

1650
01:50:23,654 --> 01:50:25,034
Cora.

1651
01:50:26,014 --> 01:50:30,890
What you mean like: You and me know how it happened?

1652
01:50:30,984 --> 01:50:33,444
That Aunt Jewel was murdered.

1653
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:36,392
They asked me if there was a suicide note?

1654
01:50:36,432 --> 01:50:38,239
If she had a gun in her hand?

1655
01:50:38,298 --> 01:50:42,468
And I said absolutely not. And never ever...

1656
01:50:51,862 --> 01:50:56,212
I mean nobody in our family commits suicide, right?

1657
01:50:58,131 --> 01:51:00,974
Only crazy people commit suicide.

1658
01:51:02,498 --> 01:51:05,941
I told them Aunt Jewel was definitely murdered.

1659
01:51:12,464 --> 01:51:14,739
I did good, didn't I?

1660
01:51:28,321 --> 01:51:31,888
How sweet is the air!

1661
01:51:32,953 --> 01:51:35,669
I can breathe here.

1662
01:51:38,015 --> 01:51:43,639
Away from the barbarians
who drink and drink and spill their wine.

1663
01:51:43,716 --> 01:51:51,692
Oh, how I loathe the Romans,
the Greeks, the Egyptians, and the Jews.

1664
01:51:52,746 --> 01:51:57,358
How fair the princess is.

1665
01:51:58,672 --> 01:52:01,524
She's hiding her face...

1666
01:52:02,162 --> 01:52:04,452
and her little white hands...

1667
01:52:04,605 --> 01:52:07,785
flutter like dogs.

1668
01:52:08,033 --> 01:52:13,036
They are like white butterflies.

1669
01:52:20,276 --> 01:52:22,941
Wherefore is this blood here?

1670
01:52:24,203 --> 01:52:26,175
Whose body is that?

1671
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:30,443
It is our captain, sire. He slew himself.

1672
01:52:31,736 --> 01:52:36,992
Strange. I only thought that
Roman philosophers slew themselves.

1673
01:52:39,032 --> 01:52:45,521
Yes, it is ridiculous to kill oneself!

1674
01:53:37,845 --> 01:53:39,272
Ahh!

1675
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:43,005
- Nice out here today, isn't it?
- Mmm.

1676
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:48,525
Where you going?

1677
01:53:48,627 --> 01:53:50,545
Swimming with Jason.

1678
01:53:50,654 --> 01:53:53,574
All right. Watch out for snakes now, you hear?

1679
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:57,728
- I'll see you all later.
- Uh-huh.

1680
01:54:00,842 --> 01:54:02,741
That was good, Willis.

1681
01:54:03,542 --> 01:54:05,581
- Come on, give it up.
- What?

1682
01:54:05,644 --> 01:54:07,920
Don't "what" me. Give it up.

1683
01:54:08,121 --> 01:54:09,454
Mr. Smarty-pants.

1684
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:12,020
I'm Willis: Two, Emma: Zero!
