1
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:14,176
The morning paper, m'Lord.

2
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,647
Ah Sir Robert Chiltern
a rising star in Parliament...

3
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:29,255
tonight hosts a party that
promises to be the highlight
of the social calendar...

4
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,719
Er, with his wife Lady Gertrude...

5
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,175
who is herself a leading figure
in women's prlitics.

6
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:36,039
Together...

7
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:40,327
this couple represents what is
best in the English public life...

8
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:43,719
and is a noble contrast
to the lax morality...

9
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,303
Er, so common amongst
foreign politicians.

10
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:48,519
Dear oh dear...

11
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:51,047
they will never say that about me,
will they

12
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:53,316
I sincerely hope not, sir.

13
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:55,686
Bit of a busy day today,
I'm afraid.

14
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:58,854
Distressingly little time
for sloth or idleness.

15
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,710
Sorry to hear it, sir.

16
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,878
Well, not entirely your fault,
Phipps.

17
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:05,439
Not this time.

18
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,350
Thank you, m'Lord.

19
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,581
Good morning, to Tommy.

20
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,925
Morning, Lady Chilterm.

21
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:32,543
I very much look forward
to this evening.

22
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,501
Miss Mabel...

23
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,173
Tommy.

24
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:37,540
I hope you'll be able to
make our usual appointment...

25
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,093
as I have something
particular I wish to say to you.

26
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:42,302
Good day, ladies.

27
00:02:44,356 --> 00:02:47,869
When Tommy wants to be romantic
he talks to one just like a doctor.

28
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,047
Till tonight.

29
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:51,940
Miss Mabel.

30
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,493
Lord Goring.

31
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,631
Lord Goring!

32
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:01,380
Countess-good morning.

33
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,459
Aren't you going to congratulate me,
Lord Goring?

34
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:05,156
Congratulations.

35
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:08,196
Aren't you going to ask what for?

36
00:03:08,196 --> 00:03:10,595
I have made a great decision.
I've decided to get married.

37
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,580
My God! Who to?

38
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,263
That part-is still to be decided.

39
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:18,660
Good morning, dear To Gertrude.

40
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,547
Good morning, Lady Markby.

41
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:23,363
Allow me to introduce my friend,
Mrs. Cheveley.

42
00:03:23,363 --> 00:03:25,795
Two such charming women
should know each other.

43
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:26,915
How do you do?

44
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,443
I think Mrs. Cheveley and I
have met before.

45
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,003
of course.

46
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,959
Gertrude.

47
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,419
And to think you married
Sir Robert Chiltern.

48
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:39,938
Do you know, I was so hoping to
meet your clever husband.

49
00:03:39,938 --> 00:03:41,187
Really?

50
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,419
Yes. But I have to return
to Vienna on Friday.

51
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,458
Oh dear, what a shame.

52
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:52,738
Well, perhaps I might bring her
this evening?

53
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:54,242
Yes, by all means.

54
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:55,746
What can I say?

55
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:56,898
I'd be delighted.

56
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,529
Well we'll see you tonight.

57
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,871
See you tonight.

58
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,769
You see, Phipps,
fashion is what one wears oneself.

59
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32,321
What is unfashionable...

60
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,985
is what other people wear.

61
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,168
Yes, my Lord.

62
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:36,576
Other people are quite dreadful.

63
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,689
The only possible society is oneself.

64
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:40,001
Er, yes, my Lord.

65
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:42,237
To love oneself...

66
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,976
is the beginning of
a lifelong romance.

67
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,405
Yes, my Lord.

68
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:02,143
Their Graces,
the Duke and Duchess of Berwick.

69
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,155
Lord Windermere.

70
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:12,766
Countess Basildon.

71
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:19,423
...and it is widely agreed,
the last truly decent man
in London...such...

72
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:22,943
and that you're a very
personable man possessed of
a most attractive personality...

73
00:05:22,943 --> 00:05:26,623
and that you have brought into
British politics an honesty,
an integrity...

74
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:27,647
a finer, a...

75
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:31,806
a nobler atmosphere a finer
attitude and higher ideals...
higher ideals.

76
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:34,046
Well, one mustn't believe everything
one reads in the newspapers.

77
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:39,678
Yes, in the old days we had the rack.
Nowadays we have the press.

78
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:43,134
Your own newspaper being the notable
exception, of course, Sir Edward...

79
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,822
where truth shines out like a beacon...

80
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:48,030
and lies run vainly for the shadows.

81
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,366
Bravo, Lady Chiltern.

82
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:53,694
But may I ask, do I detect
in your conversation a lyricism...

83
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:57,277
not entirely uncommon
in your husband's excellent speeches?

84
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,741
If you are suggesting Sir Edward...

85
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:02,493
that my position in society
owes anything to my wife,
you are utterly mistaken.

86
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:04,509
It owes everything to my wife.

87
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:06,046
I demand that you make it known

88
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:09,755
immediately without her, it's true,
I am entirely unexceptional.

89
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:12,411
Without her love...

90
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:14,776
I'm nothing.

91
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:21,724
Anyway, all I know is, Chiltern,
a serious shake-up in the Government
looks inevitable now...

92
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:25,212
and I have to tell you
the Prime Minster himself was
asking about you this morning.

93
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:26,557
Really?

94
00:06:26,557 --> 00:06:28,444
Probably afraid you'd
be taking his job.

95
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,141
Lady Markby.

96
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,180
Mrs. Cheveley.

97
00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:40,924
Oh, my dear if I had a jewel
for every staring eye...

98
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:44,347
I'm glad to say, Lady Markby,
you evidently do.

99
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:44,955
Excuse me.

100
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:48,251
Ah, chere Madame
quelle surprise!

101
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:49,436
Lady Markby.

102
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:50,684
I have not seen you since Berlin.

103
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:52,891
Not since Berlin, Vicomte,
five years ago.

104
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:56,731
And you are younger and
more beautiful than ever.

105
00:06:56,731 --> 00:06:57,755
How do you manage it?

106
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:01,820
By making it a rule only to talk
to charming people like yourself.

107
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,478
Mrs. Cheveley.

108
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,147
What do we know about her?

109
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:08,859
Very influential in Vienna
In the highest circles.

110
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:11,515
A force to be reckoned with.

111
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,859
And are you staying in
London long?

112
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:14,491
That depends partly
on the weather...

113
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:16,155
partly on the cooking...

114
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:18,331
and partly on your brother.

115
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:20,859
My dear... Sir Robert has been
dying to meet you.

116
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:24,122
Everyone is dying to meet
the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.

117
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,202
Our Attaches in Vienna write to us
about nothing else.

118
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:27,194
Thank you, Sir Robert.

119
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:31,610
An acquaintance that begins with
a compliment is sure to develop
into a real friendship.

120
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,699
I see you've met my sister.

121
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,291
Yes indeed.

122
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,116
My dear child allow me to introduce
you to the Vicomte De Nanjac.

123
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:44,666
You have a beautiful house,
Sir Robert.

124
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,010
We're very happy here.

125
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,665
I am sure. I would so love
to look around.

126
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:49,625
Allow me.

127
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,486
Thank you.

128
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:53,459
Lord Goring.

129
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:59,161
Good evening, Lady Rosebury.

130
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:01,049
Good evening, young lady.

131
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:03,449
Well, sir,
what are you doing here?

132
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,825
Wasting your life as usual.

133
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:06,777
You should be in bed, sir.
You keep too late hours.

134
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,753
I heard of you the other night
at Lady Rufford's dancing
till four o'clock.

135
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:11,545
Er, good evening, father.

136
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:14,073
Can't make out how you stand
London society.

137
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:16,697
Lot of damn nobodies
talking about nothing.

138
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,544
I love talking about nothing, father.
It's the only thing
I know anything about.

139
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:22,392
That is a paradox, sir.
I hate paradoxes.

140
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:23,769
So do I, father.

141
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,072
Everyone one meets is
a paradox nowadays.

142
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,176
Makes society so... obvious, hmm?

143
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,800
Do you always understand
what you say, sir?

144
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,957
Yes. If I listen attentively.

145
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:40,977
Oh, conceited young puppy!

146
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:45,303
And I have it on very good authority
that you have some
delightful Corots as well.

147
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:47,064
Oh, really whose?

148
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:49,136
Baron Arnheim.

149
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:55,960
Did you know the Baron well?

150
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,847
Intimately. Did you?

151
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:58,935
At one time.

152
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:00,151
Wonderful man, wasn't he?

153
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,007
He was very remarkable in many ways.

154
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:06,582
I often think it a pity he never
wrote his memoirs.
They would have been interesting.

155
00:09:06,582 --> 00:09:10,230
Allow me to introduce my dearest
friend. The idlest man in London.

156
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,375
Good evening, Lord Goring.

157
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,135
You've met?

158
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,238
I did not think you'd remember me,
Mrs. Er Cheveley.

159
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:20,055
My memory is
under admirable control.

160
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:22,294
Sir Robert,
the Indian Ambassador.

161
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:23,504
Excuse me!

162
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,238
And so, my dear Arthur...

163
00:09:29,238 --> 00:09:31,798
are you not just
a little bit pleased to see me?

164
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:34,742
Oh, my dear woman...
possibly even less than that.

165
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,693
should you wish to
avoid me entirely...

166
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:40,085
it is well to know that I'll be
staying at Claridges Hotel until Friday

167
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:42,256
when I shall return to Vienna.

168
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,789
Are you still a bachelor?

169
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:46,101
Resolutely so.

170
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:48,213
Lord Goring is the result of
Boodle's Club, Mrs. Cheveley.

171
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,709
He reflects every credit
on the institution.

172
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:51,691
Thank you.

173
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:06,771
And now, Sir Robert,
I have something to say to you.

174
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,757
You'll find me an eager audience.

175
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:09,973
I'm so glad.

176
00:10:09,973 --> 00:10:13,461
I want to talk to you about a great
political and financial scheme...

177
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:16,428
about this Argentine Company,
in fact.

178
00:10:18,004 --> 00:10:21,332
What a tedious, practical subject
to talk about, Mrs. Cheveley.

179
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:25,652
Oh, I like tedious, practical subjects.
What I don't like are
practical people.

180
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:30,324
Besides, you're interested. I know,
in international canal schemes.

181
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:31,731
Yes.

182
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:36,148
But the Suez Canal was a very
great and splendid undertaking.

183
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:39,246
It gave us our direct route
into India.

184
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:43,763
This Argentine scheme is
a commonplace Stock Exchange swindle.

185
00:10:43,763 --> 00:10:47,572
It is a speculation, Sir Robert,
a brilliant, daring speculation.

186
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:51,283
Believe me, Mrs. Cheveley,
it is a swindle.

187
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,861
Let us call things by their proper
names. It makes matters simpler.

188
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,018
I hope you've not invested in it.

189
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:01,938
I'm sure you're far too clever
to have done that.

190
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:05,651
I have invested very largely in it.

191
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:07,123
Who could have advised you to do
such a foolish thing?

192
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:08,594
Your old friend and mine.

193
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:09,202
Who?

194
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,034
Baron Arnheim.

195
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:12,969
It was one of the last things
he said.

196
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,953
The future of the canal depends,
of course, on the attitude
of Her Majesty's Government.

197
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,673
And...

198
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:34,225
I will personally be
presenting my report...

199
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:37,324
to the House of Commons
on Thursday night.

200
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:41,105
I can tell you now that I will
be condemning the scheme in

201
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:42,737
no uncertain terms.

202
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:43,825
That you must not do.

203
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:45,969
In your own interests,
to say nothing of mine...

204
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:48,369
you must not do that.

205
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:50,449
Mr. dear Mrs. Cheveley
what do you mean?

206
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:52,721
Sir Robert,
I will be quite frank with you.

207
00:11:52,721 --> 00:11:57,073
I want you to amend that report
to state that the canal
will be of international value.

208
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:59,047
Will you do that for me?

209
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:04,113
You cannot be serious.

210
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:05,360
I am quite serious...

211
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,680
and if you do what I ask
I will pay you very handsomely.

212
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,481
Pay me?

213
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:14,032
My dear Sir Robert, you are
a man of the world and
you have you price, I suppose.

214
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:15,760
Everybody has nowadays.

215
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,504
If you will allow me,
I will call your carriage for you.

216
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:21,328
You have lived so long abroad,
Mrs. Cheveley...

217
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:24,431
that you seem to be unable to
realise that you're talking
to an English gentleman.

218
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:26,224
I realize that
I'm talking to a man...

219
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:30,664
whose past is perhaps less perfect
than his reputation would suggest.

220
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:35,599
What are you saying?

221
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:39,119
I am saying that
I know the real origin of your wealth
and your career...

222
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:42,054
...and I have got your letter too.

223
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,254
You are very late.

224
00:12:46,254 --> 00:12:47,311
Did you miss me?

225
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:48,047
Awfully.

226
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:50,927
Then I am sorry I did not stay away
later. I like being missed.

227
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:51,982
How very selfish of you.

228
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:53,230
I am very selfish.

229
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,726
Lord Goring, you are always telling
me about your bad qualities.

230
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,678
And I haven't told you the half of
them as yet. Miss Mabel.

231
00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:59,631
Really? Are the others very bad?

232
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:04,202
Quite dreadful.
When I think of them at night
I can go to sleep at once.

233
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:06,542
Well...

234
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:10,958
I must tell you that
I like your qualities and
I wouldn't have you part with one.

235
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,678
This shows
your admirable good taste.

236
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:16,269
Miss Mabel. May I have the pleasure
of escorting you to the music room?

237
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,605
Why, Tommy, I'd be delighted.

238
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:19,790
As indeed would I.

239
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,102
Are you coming to the music room?

240
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:23,949
Um, not if there is any music
going on, Miss Mabel.

241
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:26,670
Well the music is in German...

242
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,430
so you would not understand it.

243
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,502
Quite so, quite so.

244
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,877
Arthur!

245
00:13:32,877 --> 00:13:34,285
Gertrude, good evening.

246
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:36,077
Didn't think you liked
political parties.

247
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:40,965
I adore political parties.
They're the place left
where people don't talk politics.

248
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,340
The affair to which you allude
was no more than a speculation.

249
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,749
It was a swindle, Sir Robert.

250
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:52,426
"Let's call things by their proper
names. It makes matters simpler."

251
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:55,661
And now I'm going to
sell you that letter back...

252
00:13:55,661 --> 00:14:00,679
and the price I ask for it is
your public support
of the Argentine scheme.

253
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:04,236
I cannot do what you ask me.

254
00:14:04,236 --> 00:14:07,499
You are standing on the edge of
a precipice, Sir Robert.

255
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,379
Supposing you refuse?

256
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:10,987
What then?

257
00:14:10,987 --> 00:14:13,580
Suppose I were to pay a visit
to a newspaper office

258
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,428
and give them this scandal...
and the proof of it.

259
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:17,963
Think of their loathsome joy.

260
00:14:17,963 --> 00:14:20,524
Think of the delight they would
have in tearing you down.

261
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:21,771
Think...

262
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:23,364
Sir Edward.

263
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:26,219
My dear Mrs. Cheveley.

264
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:29,099
I do hope we have the opportunity
to meet up while you're in London.

265
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:31,787
I so enjoy the cut and thrust
of continental politics.

266
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,308
I shall make it a
particular priority.

267
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,865
Sir Robert.

268
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:45,962
It is infamous what you propose.

269
00:14:45,962 --> 00:14:46,762
Infamous.

270
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,771
Oh no... it is the game of life,
Sir Robert...

271
00:14:49,771 --> 00:15:15,625
...as we all have to play it...
sooner of later.

272
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:19,305
What a charming house, Lady Chiltern.
I have spent a delightful evening.

273
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:21,033
I'm so glad.

274
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:25,097
And so glad, too, you had a chance
to meet my husband, Mrs. Cheveley.

275
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:26,921
Though...

276
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:31,433
I must confess to some curiosity as
to the matter of your conversation.

277
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,257
Your carriage is waiting,
Mrs. Cheveley.

278
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:34,345
Thanks.

279
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:37,961
Well, another time perhaps,
Lady Chiltern, Good evening.

280
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:40,066
Good evening, Mrs. Cheveley.

281
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:42,952
Will you see me out, Sir Robert?

282
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:45,224
Now that we have
the same interests at heart,

283
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:48,540
we will be great friends, I hope.

284
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:50,557
Certainly.

285
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,855
You must let me have more time
to consider your proposal.

286
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:02,824
There is nothing to consider.
Support the scheme and
I will return the letter.

287
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:05,864
Scandals used to lend charm,
or at least interest, to a man...

288
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:10,247
nowadays they crush him. And yours
is a very nasty scandal, Sir Robert.

289
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:12,551
You would be hounded
out of public life.

290
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:15,039
You would disappear completely.

291
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,120
My God!

292
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:19,975
What brought you into my life?

293
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:21,383
Circumstances.

294
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:27,013
At some point we all have to pay for
what we do. You have to pay now.

295
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:31,879
I will give you any sum of money
you want.

296
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,463
Even you're not rich enough
to buy back your past.

297
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:37,601
No man is.

298
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,262
...yes, but the fact is,
father this is not my day
for talking seriously.

299
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:01,605
I am very sorry
but it is not my day.

300
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,598
What do you mean, sir?

301
00:17:02,598 --> 00:17:04,485
I mean that during the season,
father...

302
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:08,101
I only talk seriously on the
first Tuesday in every month.

303
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:08,997
Between noon and three.

304
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:11,109
Well make it Tuesday, sir.
Make it Tuesday.

305
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,478
Ah, yes, but it's before noon,
father...

306
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:15,653
and that's what I'm trying to say.
I'm very sorry but my doctor
said specifically.

307
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:17,507
You are thirty-six...

308
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,845
Father!

309
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,253
I only admit to thirty-two.

310
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:22,405
You are thirty-six...

311
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:24,037
and you must get a wife.

312
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:26,110
Wife?

313
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:32,828
A shade lack luster this morning,
Chiltern.

314
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:38,532
Mind on other matters
I shouldn't wonder.

315
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:44,154
I had that Cheveley woman drive
by the office last night.

316
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:45,604
Really?

317
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:48,004
Yes.

318
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:52,324
Wanted me to write a piece
about this Argentine thing.

319
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:55,011
Quite interesting really.

320
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:56,100
Mentioned you.

321
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,572
Did she?

322
00:17:57,572 --> 00:17:59,677
She did indeed.

323
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:04,452
So what did she say?

324
00:18:04,452 --> 00:18:08,099
Outlined the virtues of the scheme,
that sort of thing.

325
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:11,171
Wouldn't be surprised
if she had shares in it.

326
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:13,123
What did she say about me?

327
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:16,451
About your speech on it. Said I
should be prepared for a surprise.

328
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,207
Wouldn't say what.

329
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:22,391
Can I take it
you've changed your position?

330
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:35,075
I wonder what kind of
a woman she is.

331
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:36,514
Who?

332
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:39,394
That woman, Mrs. Cheveley.

333
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:42,111
Hmm, smallish.

334
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,178
So the question remains,
where to from there, hmm?

335
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:50,618
To the Hartlocks then the Basildons.

336
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:53,217
...or should we go straight
to the Bachelor's Ball?

337
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,257
You know, Arthur, I almost wish
I were you sometimes.

338
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:58,241
Hmm, do you know, Robert,
I almost wish you were too.

339
00:18:58,241 --> 00:19:02,721
Except that you'd probably
make something useful out of
my life and would never do.

340
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:04,449
You could always get married.

341
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:07,199
It's the "always"
bit that alarms me.

342
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:13,376
...and I could see by the glare
in his eye that he was about
to do it again!

343
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:14,785
Poor Mr. Trafford.

344
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:16,353
It sounds quite serious.

345
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:17,409
Oh, it is.

346
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,265
He proposed to me in broad daylight

347
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:21,249
in front of that dreadful
statue of Achilles.

348
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:25,504
oh really, the things that go on
in front of that work of
art are quite appalling.

349
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:27,260
The police should interfere.

350
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:33,664
I know it may not suit
a modern girl like you, Mabel,

351
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:37,088
but there is, of course,
one...effective way

352
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:38,752
to put a stop to his proposals.

353
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:39,744
And what would that be?

354
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:41,152
To accept one of them.

355
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:43,291
Oh no!

356
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:45,309
Ladies!

357
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:50,144
By the way have you been
talking to my father?

358
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:51,104
Why? Should I?

359
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:53,176
Certainly not.

360
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,535
He was foolish enough to
suggest that I model myself on you.

361
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:00,799
I've always said that your father
was a man of exquisite
taste and rare judgement.

362
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,191
Hard work, probity and a good woman.

363
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:08,095
He neglected to mention that you
took the last good woman I know.

364
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:11,391
Took her right out of my arms,
if I remember correctly.

365
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,206
Which you don't.
what's that saying about the sea
and there being fish in it?

366
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:17,150
Hmm, ah, yes, but I couldn't
possibly marry a fish.

367
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,079
I'd be sure to land an old trout.

368
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,990
I never change
except in my affection.

369
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,543
What a noble nature you have,
Gwendolen!

370
00:20:28,382 --> 00:20:30,654
Well then the question had better
be cleared up at once.

371
00:20:30,654 --> 00:20:31,678
But you told me yesterday.

372
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:35,038
I have reason to believe that
the information I received was...

373
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:36,467
prejudiced.

374
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,262
Or any rate, misinformed.

375
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:39,773
But I...

376
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,622
I now believe that there may be
some benefit to the scheme after all.

377
00:20:42,622 --> 00:20:43,965
Benefit?

378
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:45,689
To whom?

379
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:50,937
This has nothing to do with
Mrs. Cheveley, does it?

380
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:57,075
You seem to be displaying
signs of triviality.

381
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:59,133
On the contrary, Aunt Augusta...

382
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,693
I've now realized for
the first time in my life...

383
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,108
the vital importance
of being earnest.

384
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,591
Robert...

385
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:14,769
You are telling me
the whole truth?

386
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:18,324
Why do ask me such a question?

387
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,354
Why do you not answer it?

388
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:32,983
Author!

389
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,972
Ladies and gentlemen...

390
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:40,667
I have enjoyed this evening
immensely.

391
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,899
Robert, is there,
in your life, any...

392
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:49,692
any secret, any...

393
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:52,561
indiscretion?

394
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,939
...which persuades me...

395
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,915
that you think as highly
of the play as I so myself.

396
00:21:57,915 --> 00:21:59,675
You must tell me, you must,
you must tell me at once.

397
00:21:59,675 --> 00:22:04,726
Oh, Gertrude, there is nothing in my
past life that you might not know.

398
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:11,451
I was sure of it, my darling.

399
00:22:11,451 --> 00:22:13,239
I was sure of it.

400
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:44,569
You know, I found it a perfectly
charming evening. Of course I did.

401
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:47,481
And yours was a perfectly
charming performance.

402
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:53,013
The costumes were, of course,
delightful, but for me
... it was the acting.

403
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,383
Would you excuse me a moment?

404
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:01,721
Miss Mabel?

405
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,129
Good evening, Lord Goring.

406
00:23:03,129 --> 00:23:04,472
Shouldn't you be in bed,
Miss Mabel?

407
00:23:04,472 --> 00:23:05,817
Lord Goring!

408
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,320
My father always tells me
to go to bed,

409
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,984
so I don't see why I shouldn't
give you the same advice.

410
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:12,728
I always pass on good advice.
It's the only sensible thing
to do with it.

411
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:14,265
Well, it's very kind of you
to offer Lord Goring.

412
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:15,385
Don't mention it, Miss Mabel.

413
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:17,336
But I feel I should report...

414
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:21,656
that the role of elder brother is
for the moment, being more
than adequately performed...

415
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:22,808
...by my elder brother.

416
00:23:22,808 --> 00:23:23,384
Oh, really?

417
00:23:23,384 --> 00:23:29,368
Yes, Charming and delightful
performance it is too.

418
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,896
I really think you ought to go to
bed straight away, Miss Mabel.

419
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:35,767
Lord Goring
you're ordering me around.

420
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:38,102
I think
it's most courageous of you.

421
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:41,999
'Specially as
I'm not going to bed for hours.

422
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:02,967
Darling, you will write
won't you

423
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:04,854
to Mrs. Cheveley?

424
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:08,694
And tell her that you cannot
support this scheme of hers.

425
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:10,934
I might see her.

426
00:24:10,934 --> 00:24:13,590
Perhaps that would be better.

427
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,502
Oh no, Robert, you must never
see her again.

428
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:19,382
Darling, I know this woman.
We were at school together.

429
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:23,189
I didn't trust her then and
I don't trust her now.

430
00:24:23,189 --> 00:24:27,979
And she must know at once that
she has been mistaken in you.

431
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:34,198
Now all your life you have stood
apart from others.

432
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:37,237
To the world, as to myself...

433
00:24:37,237 --> 00:24:42,229
you have been an ideal.
Always.

434
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:44,618
Be that ideal still.

435
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:01,525
Claridges Hotel.

436
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:02,356
No answer.

437
00:25:02,356 --> 00:25:05,203
Sir.

438
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,889
I love you, Robert.

439
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,244
Oh, love me.

440
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:28,625
Love me, Gertrude.

441
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,529
Love me always.

442
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,283
Madam.

443
00:25:55,283 --> 00:25:58,419
So, what is it that brings you back
to London after all these years?

444
00:25:58,419 --> 00:25:59,954
Business or pleasure?

445
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:03,026
As it happens I have
some business with your friend,
Sir Robert Chiltern...

446
00:26:03,026 --> 00:26:06,255
which, is of course,
a great pleasure.

447
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,449
And what is it that
brings you here tonight?

448
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,794
I came because you asked me to.

449
00:26:15,794 --> 00:26:17,522
And because you were curious?

450
00:26:17,522 --> 00:26:18,514
I suppose.

451
00:26:18,514 --> 00:26:19,538
Why did you ask me?

452
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:22,225
Because I was curious also
to see whether you'd come.

453
00:26:22,225 --> 00:26:24,242
And you did.

454
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:27,025
I see you are quite as wilful
as you used to be.

455
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:31,633
Far more. I've greatly improved.
I've had more experience.

456
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,161
Too much experience can be a very
dangerous thing, Mrs. Cheveley.

457
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,889
Why don't you call me Laura?

458
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:36,529
I don't like the name.

459
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,553
You used to adore it.

460
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:39,921
Yes, that is why.

461
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:43,729
To think,it was so nearly
Laura Goring.

462
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:46,417
It has a certain ring,
don't you agree?

463
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:49,137
We were quite well suited
I remember.

464
00:26:49,137 --> 00:26:52,368
Well, you were poor, I was rich.
It must have suited you very well.

465
00:26:52,368 --> 00:26:54,864
Until you met the Baron,
of course...

466
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,712
who was richer and that
suited you much better.

467
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:58,640
Have you forgiven me yet?

468
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,472
My dear woman...

469
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:02,472
it's been so long now that
I'd all but forgotten you.

470
00:27:03,152 --> 00:27:04,848
Isn't that Goring?

471
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:05,520
It is.

472
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,592
I'm afraid I really must go I have
an extremely pressing engagement.

473
00:27:08,592 --> 00:27:10,991
Really? Well as you know...

474
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:14,374
I hate to stand between
a man and his affairs.

475
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:27,695
Come on, Bunbury,
for good ness sake.

476
00:27:27,695 --> 00:27:28,879
I can't believe it.

477
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:31,087
You are a deserter, sir.

478
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:32,015
I didn't say
I was getting married...

479
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,351
I was merely debating
the virtues of the marital state.

480
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:35,887
Lord Goring, there's a gentleman
to see you, sir.

481
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,423
Short debate, sir.

482
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:39,182
We're a dying breed, old man.

483
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:41,614
At all costs
we must stick together.

484
00:27:41,614 --> 00:27:43,663
If you'd excuse me, gentlemen?

485
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,092
Play the next hand without me.

486
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,902
And now I think it's time
you knew the truth...

487
00:27:57,902 --> 00:28:04,110
that all these riches
this wondrous luxury...

488
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,830
amounts finally to nothing.

489
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,502
And that power
power over other men...

490
00:28:11,502 --> 00:28:15,182
is the one and
only thing worth having.

491
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:21,194
Now this one I call
the 'Philosophy of Power'.

492
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:25,165
'Gospel of Gold'.

493
00:28:25,165 --> 00:28:27,917
So now the question arises...

494
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:30,508
how do you become
powerful.

495
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,421
I mean you
personally powerful.

496
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,363
Cigar?

497
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:37,730
Yes, thank you.

498
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,660
The answer is simple.

499
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:45,132
The answer...

500
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:48,108
is information.

501
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:50,892
Information is
the modern commodity...

502
00:28:50,892 --> 00:28:53,228
that can shake the world.

503
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:55,180
And I happen to know...

504
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,376
it's well within your grasp.

505
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:03,680
And you believed what he said?

506
00:29:04,204 --> 00:29:06,026
Certainly.

507
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:09,098
I believed it
then and I believe it now.

508
00:29:10,924 --> 00:29:12,779
You've never been poor.

509
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,842
You've never known
what ambition is.

510
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:19,587
Go on.

511
00:29:20,107 --> 00:29:22,987
Well, by now Lord Radley was
a Cabinet Minister and...

512
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:27,243
as the Baron well knew, I was
working as his personal secretary.

513
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:32,099
And one night, as usual
I was the last to leave the office.

514
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:41,930
Later that evening...

515
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,258
I wrote the Baron a letter containing
highly confidential information.

516
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:51,488
And highly valuable information
regarding the financing
of the Suez Canal.

517
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,962
A Cabinet. Secret?

518
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:56,199
Indeed.

519
00:29:56,426 --> 00:30:01,865
In a subsequent transaction
the Baron made for himself
three quarters of a million pounds.

520
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:04,036
And you?

521
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:09,055
I received from the Baron one
hundred and ten thousand pounds.

522
00:30:11,657 --> 00:30:13,577
You were worth more, Robert.

523
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:15,753
No. No. No.

524
00:30:15,753 --> 00:30:20,937
I got exactly what I wanted
I entered straight into
Parliament and I've...

525
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:23,326
well I've never looked back.

526
00:30:23,784 --> 00:30:26,953
Is it fair, Arthur, that some act
of youthful folly...

527
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:29,161
should be brought up against me
now all these years later?

528
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,120
Is it fair?

529
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,392
Robert, life is never fair

530
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:34,952
And Perhaps it is a good thing for
most of us that it's not.

531
00:30:34,952 --> 00:30:38,301
Now, what does Gertrude
make of all this?

532
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,467
Robert?

533
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:46,920
My dear Robert...

534
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,824
secrets from other people's wives are
necessary luxury in modern life.

535
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:54,759
But no man should have
a secret from his own wife.

536
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,648
She invariably finds it out.

537
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:57,864
If I were to tell her, Arthur,

538
00:30:57,864 --> 00:31:01,246
I would lose the love of the one
woman in the world I worship.

539
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:03,527
I couldn't tell her, but it

540
00:31:03,527 --> 00:31:05,862
did strike me
that perhaps you might.

541
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:09,734
Go on.

542
00:31:10,183 --> 00:31:13,735
Well, perhaps you might
talk with her.

543
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:14,279
Oh really.

544
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,647
Not to tell her, of course...

545
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:19,713
but just to
talk with her.

546
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:21,828
I see.

547
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:27,110
It's just that Gertrude can sometimes
be a little hard-headed.

548
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,302
And you are her oldest and
perhaps closest friend and I,
and I just thought...

549
00:31:31,302 --> 00:31:33,734
talking with you might perhaps...

550
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:35,302
soften her head a little?

551
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:37,212
Well,it has been known.

552
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,454
Thank you, Lady chiltern,
that was most inspiring.

553
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:45,828
Oh, I'm so glad.

554
00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:57,029
Well I must say, Arthur...

555
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:01,829
I'm delighted to find you showing
such a keen interest
in women's politics.

556
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:03,390
Oh yes, very keen.

557
00:32:03,845 --> 00:32:06,277
I'm afraid I had a little bit
of a late night last night.

558
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:08,229
So I gather.

559
00:32:08,229 --> 00:32:09,221
I'm so glad to see you.

560
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:09,732
Are you?

561
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:12,581
Yes. I wanted to talk to
you about Robert.

562
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:14,010
Really?

563
00:32:14,245 --> 00:32:15,973
He seems a little...

564
00:32:15,973 --> 00:32:18,372
distracted of late.
A little anxious.

565
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:20,229
Yes.

566
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,116
You've noticed it too?

567
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:25,541
I suppose, Er yes.

568
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,724
In a way.

569
00:32:26,724 --> 00:32:30,820
I mean the life that he's chosen for
himself
by its own nature...

570
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,316
must hold innumerable stresses...

571
00:32:33,316 --> 00:32:35,140
full of countless compromises.

572
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,356
Compromises?

573
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:37,284
Well, yes.

574
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:38,531
What I mean is...

575
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:44,036
...once a man has set his heart
and soul on getting to
a certain point...

576
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:48,868
if he has to climb the crag,
he has to climb the crag.

577
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,108
And if he has to walk
in the mire...

578
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:53,347
Well?

579
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:57,059
Well then he has to walk,
my dear Gertrude, in the mire.

580
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,331
Of course I'm only talking
in the most general terms and

581
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:01,891
on a subject about which
I know absolutely nothing.

582
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:05,251
I always thought those were
your favourite subjects, Arthur.

583
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:09,283
Yes, indeed Indeed.

584
00:33:09,283 --> 00:33:10,787
Go on.

585
00:33:10,787 --> 00:33:12,194
Oh yes, no, umm...

586
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:15,586
No but supposing, for instance,
a public figure, any public figure

587
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:18,595
...Er, Lord Merton or my father
or Robert even say...

588
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:22,594
had, years ago, written some
foolish letter to someone...

589
00:33:22,594 --> 00:33:24,514
what do you mean by
a foolish letter'?

590
00:33:24,514 --> 00:33:29,506
well, I mean a letter gravely
compromising one's position.

591
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:32,642
I'm putting an imaginary case,
of course.

592
00:33:32,642 --> 00:33:38,588
I cannot help but feel, Arthur,
that you are wanting to
tell me something.

593
00:33:42,305 --> 00:33:45,345
What I really want to say,
dear Gertrude, is...

594
00:33:45,345 --> 00:33:50,882
that if for any reason
you are ever in trouble...

595
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:55,105
come to me at once and know that
I will help you in every way I can.

596
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:56,994
Lord Goring...

597
00:33:56,994 --> 00:34:00,513
you are talking quite seriously.

598
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:03,264
Well, you must forgive me,
Lady chiltern. It won't occur again.

599
00:34:03,264 --> 00:34:04,353
No, I like you to be serious.

600
00:34:04,353 --> 00:34:05,792
Gertrude?

601
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:08,705
Please don't say such
dreadful things to Lord Goring.

602
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:11,296
Seriousness would be
very unbecoming to him.

603
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:13,792
Good morning, Lord Goring.
Pray be as trivial as you can.

604
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:17,312
Oh I should like to,
but I'm afraid I'm a little
out of practice this morning.

605
00:34:17,312 --> 00:34:19,808
Besides,
I really ought to be going.

606
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,697
Oh, will you be there tonight?

607
00:34:21,697 --> 00:34:23,776
Well, I've received no invitation.

608
00:34:23,776 --> 00:34:26,848
Well, you have now.

609
00:34:26,848 --> 00:34:29,312
I'm sorry, Mabel, I'm not
in the mood for modern art.

610
00:34:29,312 --> 00:34:34,048
You don't mind, do you,
if Arthur escorts you in my place?

611
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:36,063
As long as he promises
not to be serious.

612
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:37,536
For I have observed
a worrying trend.

613
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:41,792
I swear on my life to be utterly
trivial and never to keep my word.

614
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
In which case
I shall be delighted.

615
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,992
In which case so shall I.

616
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:46,934
My dear, Gertrude
thank you.

617
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:51,360
You will remember
what I said to you,won't you?

618
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,719
Yes. But I still
don't know why you said it.

619
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,127
I hardly know myself.

620
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,915
Goodbye. Miss Mabel.

621
00:34:59,071 --> 00:35:00,315
Lord Goring?

622
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,163
Lord Goring?

623
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:07,646
What dreadful manners you have,
leaving just as I arrive.

624
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,599
I'm sure you were
very badly brought up.

625
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,526
Hmm, I was.

626
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:11,678
I wish I had brought you up.

627
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:13,727
I'm sorry you didn't.

628
00:35:13,727 --> 00:35:15,614
It is too late now, I suppose?

629
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,850
I shouldn't think so for a moment.

630
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,680
So...

631
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:32,445
So...

632
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:34,558
Till tonight then.

633
00:35:34,558 --> 00:35:36,630
Eight o'clock.

634
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:38,772
Eight o'clock.

635
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,253
So...

636
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:50,292
So...

637
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,620
My dear Sir Robert...

638
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,909
I must confess to being
not disappointed to receive
your letter of last night...

639
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:01,789
and to learn that my proposition
held no interest for you.

640
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:06,716
perhaps I failed to present it
in sufficiently attractive
or persuasive terms.

641
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:09,948
Another time perhaps
Yours sincerely...

642
00:36:09,948 --> 00:36:11,837
Laura Cheveley.

643
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,748
Ps. If I should be
in the neighbourhood...

644
00:36:14,748 --> 00:36:17,820
I might just pay my respects
to your charming wife.

645
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,616
I wonder whether the matter
would be of any interest to her?

646
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:25,912
Mrs. Cheveley?

647
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,571
Won't you sit down?

648
00:36:28,571 --> 00:36:30,555
Thanks.

649
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,419
And you know...

650
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:34,907
I can't help feeling that
this disturbing new thing, this...

651
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:36,923
'Higher Education of Women'

652
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:39,515
will deal a terrible blow to
happy married life.

653
00:36:39,515 --> 00:36:41,915
The higher education of men is
what I should like to see.

654
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:43,387
Men need it so sadly.

655
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:46,747
They do, dear. But I'm afraid such
a scheme would be quite unpractical.

656
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:49,435
I don't think man has much
capacity for development

657
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:51,258
He's got as far as he can.

658
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:53,211
And that's not far, is it?

659
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,450
With regard to women, well,
dear Gertrude...

660
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,851
modern women understand everything,
I'm told.

661
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:01,882
Except their husbands.
That is the one thing
the modern woman never understands.

662
00:37:01,882 --> 00:37:04,187
And a very good thing too, dear,
I dare say...

663
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:07,962
it might break up many
a happy home if they did.

664
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:10,938
Not yours, I need hardly say,
Gertrude.

665
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:14,135
You have married
the perfect husband.

666
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,266
And now, dear ladies,
I had better set forth.

667
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:20,474
I haven't time to be
idling around here all day.

668
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:24,153
I should be idling around
somewhere else very shortly
or I shall fall behind.

669
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:27,129
No, no, I'll see myself out.

670
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:31,674
No doubt you both have
pleasant reminiscences of
your school days to talk together.

671
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:32,409
Goodbye.

672
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:33,554
Goodbye, my dear

673
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:41,241
Wonderful woman, Lady Markby,
isn't she?

674
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:44,185
Talks more and says less than
anybody I ever met.

675
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:45,785
Now, Gertrude.

676
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:48,021
Mrs. Cheveley.

677
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,177
I think it is right to tell you
that I wish you never to
return to this house again.

678
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:56,633
And never to attempt to
contact my husband.

679
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:59,288
I see that after all these years
you've not changed a bit.

680
00:37:59,288 --> 00:38:00,569
I hope I never will.

681
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,137
Then life's taught you nothing?

682
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:03,384
It has taught me that

683
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:07,288
a person who has
once been guilty of a dishonest
and dishonorable action

684
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:10,328
may be guilty of it
a second time and should be shunned.

685
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:12,728
Would you apply that rule
to everyone?

686
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:15,127
Yes. Without exception.

687
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,047
Then I am sorry for you
Gertrude.

688
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,575
Very sorry for you.

689
00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:22,232
I thank you for your sympathy...

690
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:26,006
but it is your departure
I would prefer.

691
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:30,519
Do you know, Gertrude, I don't mind
you talking morality a bit.

692
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:34,007
Morality is simply the attitude
we adopt towards people
whom we personally dislike.

693
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:36,183
You dislike me.
I am quite aware of that.

694
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:38,263
And I have always detested you.

695
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:42,423
And yet I have come here
to give you some advice.

696
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:44,919
I hold your husband
in the hollow of my hand...

697
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:48,407
and if you are wise you'll make him
do what I tell him.

698
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:52,951
How dare you class my husband
with yourself?!

699
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:54,966
Leave my house!

700
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:56,790
You are unfit to enter it!

701
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:00,182
Your house? A house bought
with the price of dishonour?

702
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:04,086
Everything in which has been
paid for by fraud.

703
00:39:04,086 --> 00:39:06,902
Ask him what the origin of
his fortune is.

704
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:11,190
Get him to tell you how he sold
to a stockbroker a Cabinet secret.

705
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:15,574
Learn from him to what
you owe your position.

706
00:39:15,574 --> 00:39:17,525
It is not true.

707
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:18,966
Robert...

708
00:39:18,966 --> 00:39:20,875
tell her it is not true.

709
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,108
Go.

710
00:39:30,261 --> 00:39:34,384
Go at once.
You've done your worst now.

711
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:44,308
Dear Sir Robert...

712
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:45,109
Lady Chiltern...

713
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:49,940
unless you meet my terms I think
you'll fine the worst is yet to come.

714
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:52,875
You have until
half past ten tonight.

715
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:00,401
Tell me it is not true.

716
00:40:03,348 --> 00:40:04,404
Let me explain...

717
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:06,932
Tell me it is not true!

718
00:40:06,932 --> 00:40:08,724
Please. Iet me tell you,
please! Listen to me!

719
00:40:08,724 --> 00:40:10,292
No, don't come near me!
Don't touch me!

720
00:40:10,292 --> 00:40:11,220
Listen to me!

721
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,180
How could you?!

722
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,548
How could you do that, Robert?!

723
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:18,675
You've lied to the whole world!

724
00:40:18,675 --> 00:40:20,595
You, you will not lie to me.

725
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,099
Gertrude, please, I must tell you!

726
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:24,520
No, don't say...
don't say anything!

727
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,658
You were to me...

728
00:40:32,658 --> 00:40:35,987
something apart from common life.

729
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:40,624
A thing noble pure.

730
00:40:42,322 --> 00:40:46,387
The world seemed to me
finer because you were in it.

731
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:50,249
And goodness more real
because you lived...

732
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:58,224
I'm... I'm sorry.

733
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,704
So very sorry.

734
00:41:08,785 --> 00:41:12,680
I, I suppose I should go.

735
00:41:13,649 --> 00:41:14,413
Should I?

736
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:26,470
Go.

737
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:30,248
Get out!

738
00:42:13,423 --> 00:42:16,815
Ah, my second button-hole.
Much better.

739
00:42:16,815 --> 00:42:17,359
And, do you know, Phipps...

740
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,103
a really well made
button-hole is the only link...

741
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:22,959
between art and nature.

742
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:25,064
Yes, my Lord.

743
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:32,073
I don't think
I quite like this one.

744
00:42:33,582 --> 00:42:36,015
Makes me look a little old.

745
00:42:36,015 --> 00:42:39,854
Makes me almost
in the prime of life?

746
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:44,046
I don't observe any alteration
in your Lordship's appearance.

747
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:45,102
You don't?

748
00:42:45,102 --> 00:42:47,404
No, my Lord.

749
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,081
Hmm, very well.

750
00:42:56,718 --> 00:42:57,998
Oh my God!

751
00:42:57,998 --> 00:43:00,622
Father,
how delightful to see you.

752
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:01,326
Take my cloak off.

753
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:02,862
Er, is it really worthwhile,
father?

754
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:04,462
Of course it's worthwhile, sir.

755
00:43:04,462 --> 00:43:08,141
Ah, but you see I'm afraid
I've recently made a resolution
not to have visitors...

756
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:10,573
on Thursday between er,
seven and nine in the evening.

757
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:13,485
Glad to hear it.
Can't stand interruptions.

758
00:43:13,485 --> 00:43:14,925
No draught, I hope,
in this room.

759
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,747
No, sir.

760
00:43:17,005 --> 00:43:18,828
I feel a draught, sir.
I feel it distinctly.

761
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:19,917
So do I, sir.

762
00:43:19,917 --> 00:43:22,983
A dreadful draught, sir.
Why don't you go home?

763
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:25,901
I will come and see you
tomorrow and we can talk about
anything you like then.

764
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:29,581
I have called this evening
with a definite purpose...

765
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:32,940
and I'm going to see it through at all
cost to my health or yours.

766
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,079
Put my cloak down, sir.

767
00:43:35,436 --> 00:43:37,165
I hate seeing things through,
father

768
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:40,556
especially when it's
through someone else's eyes.

769
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:42,476
'Fraid I don't follow you there.
sir.

770
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:44,647
Well, as far as I can make out,
you seem to follow me everywhere,
father.

771
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,049
I'll take that...

772
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:49,324
Oh God!

773
00:43:49,324 --> 00:43:50,892
Good evening, Arthur.

774
00:43:50,892 --> 00:43:51,852
My dear Robert.

775
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:54,444
The fact is I really am
horribly busy tonight.

776
00:43:54,444 --> 00:43:57,259
But, Arthur,
I must speak with you.

777
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,260
Gertrude has
discovered the truth?

778
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,365
Yes, I'm afraid she has.

779
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:07,851
Come in, Robert. Come in.

780
00:44:07,851 --> 00:44:10,027
But, if you wouldn't mind
waiting for a short while...

781
00:44:10,027 --> 00:44:15,083
I'm afraid I'm right in the middle
of giving my performance
of the attentive son.

782
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,043
Oh, I'm sorry.

783
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:17,537
Hmm, so am I.

784
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:21,409
Phipps.

785
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:29,897
God!

786
00:44:30,186 --> 00:44:33,994
When you left this afternoon
my life fell apart.

787
00:44:33,994 --> 00:44:35,850
My love is in ruins.

788
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,122
I need you after all.

789
00:44:38,122 --> 00:44:41,089
I am coming to you now Gertrude.

790
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:44,906
There is a lady coming to see me
this evening on particular business.

791
00:44:44,906 --> 00:44:47,690
Show her into the drawing room when
she arrives. Do you understand?

792
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,777
Ah, yes, my Lord.

793
00:44:48,777 --> 00:44:50,730
This is a matter of
the gravest importance.

794
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,074
I understand, my Lord.

795
00:44:52,074 --> 00:44:55,114
No one else is to be admitted
under any circumstances.

796
00:44:55,114 --> 00:44:56,074
Tell them I'm not at home.

797
00:44:56,074 --> 00:44:57,065
I understand, my Lord.

798
00:44:57,065 --> 00:44:57,577
Good.

799
00:44:57,577 --> 00:44:59,466
Arthur?

800
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:00,742
Yes, father.

801
00:45:08,745 --> 00:45:10,752
Good evening, Phipps.

802
00:45:11,305 --> 00:45:14,021
How nice to see you again, madam.

803
00:45:19,336 --> 00:45:22,920
His Lordship is engaged at present
with Lord Caversham, madam.

804
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,375
How very filial.

805
00:45:25,608 --> 00:45:28,552
His Lordship told me to ask you,
madam...

806
00:45:28,552 --> 00:45:32,424
Er, to be kind enough, Er,
to wait in the drawing room for him.

807
00:45:32,424 --> 00:45:34,312
His Lordship will come to you there.

808
00:45:34,312 --> 00:45:36,711
Lord Goring expects me?

809
00:45:36,711 --> 00:45:38,021
Yes, madam.

810
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:40,103
Are you quite sure?

811
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:44,424
His Lordship's directions
on the subject were very precise.

812
00:45:44,424 --> 00:45:47,271
No, I don't care for that lamp.
It is far too glaring.

813
00:45:47,271 --> 00:45:48,807
Light some candles.

814
00:45:48,807 --> 00:45:50,302
Certainly, madam.

815
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:54,407
Marriage
is not a matter of affection...

816
00:45:54,407 --> 00:45:56,807
it is a question of common sense.

817
00:45:56,807 --> 00:46:00,839
Yes, but women who have common sense
are usually so curiously plain.

818
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:02,983
Of course I'm only speaking
from hearsay.

819
00:46:02,983 --> 00:46:04,935
No woman, plain or pretty,
has any sense are so plain,
aren't they, father.

820
00:46:04,935 --> 00:46:06,726
Common sense is a privilege
of our sex.

821
00:46:06,726 --> 00:46:10,375
Quite so and we men are so
self-sacrificing we never use it,

822
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:11,367
do we, father?

823
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:13,958
I use it, sir.
I use nothing else.

824
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:15,207
Mum, so my mother tells me.

825
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,956
It is the secret of
your mother's happiness.

826
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,968
What was that?

827
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,902
Nothing, father. Nothing.

828
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:28,134
You are heartless, sir
Very heartless.

829
00:46:28,134 --> 00:46:30,306
Oh, I hope not, father.

830
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:40,350
When you left this afternoon
my life fell apart...

831
00:46:45,797 --> 00:46:49,114
I am coming to you now
Gertrude.

832
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,515
There we are, madam.

833
00:46:57,285 --> 00:46:58,245
Thank you.

834
00:46:58,245 --> 00:46:59,423
Thank you, madam.

835
00:47:20,452 --> 00:47:24,608
I'm afraid His Lordship's not
at home this evening, milady.

836
00:47:27,908 --> 00:47:29,252
I, I see.

837
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:31,837
I'm sorry, Lady Chiltern.

838
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:33,953
Not at all.

839
00:47:42,595 --> 00:47:44,734
...as you keep saying.

840
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:48,355
Is in there?

841
00:47:48,355 --> 00:47:49,697
Yes, my Lord.

842
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:56,893
Oh, my dear fellow.

843
00:47:57,218 --> 00:48:01,146
I'm sorry, Arthur,
I didn't know where else to go.

844
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:10,300
I don't know what to do,
Arthur.

845
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:15,074
Robert, last night
you were telling me...

846
00:48:15,074 --> 00:48:17,218
how much Gertrude
means to you, hmm?

847
00:48:17,218 --> 00:48:19,682
How much you love her.

848
00:48:19,682 --> 00:48:21,657
More than anything
in the world.

849
00:48:22,818 --> 00:48:25,090
But there is a wide gulf
between us now...

850
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:27,937
and I fear I shall never bridge it.

851
00:48:28,482 --> 00:48:30,594
I fear she will never forgive me.

852
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:34,178
Surely there must be some sin in her
past life Any sin...

853
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:36,514
weakness, perhaps, that might well...

854
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,178
help her to understand yours.

855
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:42,017
No, I don't believe Gertrude knows
what weakness or temptation is.

856
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:45,793
But she loves you, Robert.
She cannot but forgive you.

857
00:48:45,793 --> 00:48:48,929
Now I feel certain
that if she could hear you now...

858
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:51,489
the regret you feel about
your past...

859
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:52,699
Regret?

860
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:56,097
Yes, regret...

861
00:48:56,097 --> 00:48:59,424
I feel certain that
she would pity you.

862
00:48:59,424 --> 00:49:01,889
Perhaps even at this moment
she is pitying you.

863
00:49:01,889 --> 00:49:05,217
Praying that she might
once again be in your arms.

864
00:49:05,217 --> 00:49:07,900
God grant it but I doubt it.

865
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:12,438
There is something else
I need to tell you about.

866
00:49:13,024 --> 00:49:17,279
The debate on the Argentine canal
is to begin at ten thirty.

867
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,666
I have made up my mind
what I'm going to say.

868
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:23,997
I have decided...

869
00:49:28,704 --> 00:49:29,849
What was that?

870
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:32,220
Nothing.

871
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:35,424
I heard a noise from next door.

872
00:49:35,424 --> 00:49:37,398
No, no you didn't.

873
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:42,651
Is there someone there?

874
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:44,703
Arthur?

875
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,719
Robert...you're excited,
unnerved.

876
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:49,887
There is no-one in that room.
Now sit down, old man,
for God's sake!

877
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,135
Do you give me
your word of honor?

878
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:52,695
Oh, yes!

879
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,438
Let me look for myself.

880
00:49:57,438 --> 00:49:58,078
Oh, Robert...

881
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,679
If there is no-one there
then why shouldn't I look?

882
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:03,323
Robert...there is someone
in that room.

883
00:50:07,263 --> 00:50:08,638
My dear fellow,
I do apologise but

884
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:12,126
I must state she's entirely
guiltless in this matter.

885
00:50:12,126 --> 00:50:16,382
She is scheming
devious and deceitful.

886
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:17,373
I beg your pardon?

887
00:50:17,373 --> 00:50:19,577
And you...

888
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:23,486
you are false as a friend
...and treacherous.

889
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:24,093
Robert!

890
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:25,915
Good evening, Lord Goring.

891
00:50:26,558 --> 00:50:27,932
Sir Robert.

892
00:50:28,478 --> 00:50:31,641
So tell me, Goring, how the devil do
you explain her presence here?

893
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:35,966
To be quite honest, I can't I...

894
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:38,397
I take you two have been
planning this for some time.

895
00:50:38,397 --> 00:50:41,021
Look, Robert believes me,
we have not.
We have never planned anything.

896
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:42,973
Except marriage, of course,
Lord Goring.

897
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,557
Come now, Arthur, you can't
have forgotten we were engaged
for at least three weeks.

898
00:50:46,557 --> 00:50:48,125
Yes, but...

899
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:51,709
At this moment I find it hard to
see why on earth
you broke it off You seem to be...

900
00:50:51,709 --> 00:50:53,660
entirely well suited to each other.

901
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,165
Robert, I give you my word...

902
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:56,539
No, sir.

903
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,067
Oh no, sir.

904
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:05,529
You have lied enough upon your
word of honor.

905
00:51:09,948 --> 00:51:12,697
I appear to have caused
something of a commotion.

906
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:18,262
Goodnight, Sir Robert.

907
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:38,843
You've come here to sell me
Robert Chiltern's letter.

908
00:51:38,843 --> 00:51:40,763
To offer it to you on condition.

909
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:43,032
How did you guess?

910
00:51:43,322 --> 00:51:45,850
What is your price for it?

911
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,355
My price...

912
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:50,584
I've arrived
at the romantic stage.

913
00:51:51,162 --> 00:51:53,819
When I saw you the other night
at the Chilterns'...

914
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,978
I knew you were the only person
I'd ever cared for.

915
00:51:57,978 --> 00:52:01,722
If I've ever cared for anybody,
Arthur.

916
00:52:01,722 --> 00:52:03,249
So...

917
00:52:05,114 --> 00:52:08,633
on the morning
of the day that you marry me...

918
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:11,830
I will give you
Robert Chiltern's letter.

919
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:15,638
That is my offer.

920
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:19,930
Are you quite serious?

921
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:20,954
Yes.

922
00:52:20,954 --> 00:52:22,645
Quite serious.

923
00:52:23,257 --> 00:52:26,705
My dear Mrs. Cheveley.

924
00:52:27,449 --> 00:52:29,753
I'm afraid I should make you
a very bad husband.

925
00:52:29,753 --> 00:52:32,377
I don't mind bad husbands,
I've had two

926
00:52:32,377 --> 00:52:34,743
They amuse me immensely.

927
00:52:35,512 --> 00:52:39,864
Here is a chance to rise to great
heights of self-sacrifice, Arthur.

928
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:41,624
I think you should.

929
00:52:41,624 --> 00:52:45,401
And the rest of your life
you could spend in contemplating
your own perfections.

930
00:52:45,401 --> 00:52:47,481
I do that as it is.

931
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:49,304
For the privilege of
being your wife...

932
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:54,290
I am ready to sacrifice the greatest
prize in my possession.

933
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,252
I'm honored.

934
00:53:04,152 --> 00:53:05,720
Arthur...

935
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,560
you loved me once
you asked me to be your wife...

936
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,703
ask me again.

937
00:53:11,703 --> 00:53:13,613
Ask me now.

938
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:21,422
Bonsoir.

939
00:53:30,071 --> 00:53:31,479
My dear Mrs. Cheveley.

940
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:33,999
My dear Lord Goring.

941
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:39,959
Now I'm going to give you
some good advice.

942
00:53:39,959 --> 00:53:42,295
Pray, don't One should never
give a woman anything
she can't wear in the evening.

943
00:53:42,295 --> 00:53:44,854
Oh, I'm sorry but I don't seem
to be able to stop myself.

944
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:48,919
Now, I'm going to tell you...
that love...

945
00:53:48,919 --> 00:53:52,854
about which I admit I know
so little...

946
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:56,566
Iove cannot be bought.
It can only be given.

947
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:00,597
And I sense it is not
in my power to give to you.

948
00:54:00,597 --> 00:54:05,014
And nor is it in yours I suspect...

949
00:54:05,014 --> 00:54:05,526
at all.

950
00:54:05,526 --> 00:54:09,300
Dear boy,
you underestimate us both.

951
00:54:10,901 --> 00:54:13,040
To give...

952
00:54:13,653 --> 00:54:17,013
and not expect return, hmm?

953
00:54:17,013 --> 00:54:20,693
That is what lies
at the heart of love.

954
00:54:20,693 --> 00:54:25,397
I fear though the notion
is a stranger to us both.

955
00:54:25,397 --> 00:54:27,189
And yet...

956
00:54:27,189 --> 00:54:28,917
if we are honest...

957
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:31,957
it is something we both long for

958
00:54:31,957 --> 00:54:36,626
something that it takes
great courage to do.

959
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:42,612
Yes that is our dark secret.

960
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:46,507
Your coming here tonight is
the first whisper of it.

961
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,995
And for that I admire you.

962
00:54:50,324 --> 00:54:52,528
Give me the letter.

963
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:58,740
Prove your affections to me
and give me the letter.

964
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,384
And surrender my position
of power?

965
00:55:02,643 --> 00:55:05,843
The future of a great man is
in your hands, Mrs. Cheveley.

966
00:55:05,843 --> 00:55:10,323
Crush him and your power dies
with him...

967
00:55:10,323 --> 00:55:13,555
as will any feeling
I've ever had for you.

968
00:55:13,555 --> 00:55:15,562
If you ever loved me...

969
00:55:19,347 --> 00:55:20,874
I did love you.

970
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:23,921
I know, I know.

971
00:55:29,907 --> 00:55:31,630
But not that much.

972
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:37,927
I know, I must admit
I never thought you did.

973
00:55:38,195 --> 00:55:41,138
Even so, I felt it worth a try.

974
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:44,210
I understand and respect
you all the more for the attempt.

975
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,482
And I take it you reject
my offer?

976
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:52,592
I fear I must
when tempting as it seems...
in truth...

977
00:55:53,746 --> 00:55:55,474
...it is little
more than blackmail.

978
00:55:55,474 --> 00:55:56,750
True.

979
00:56:04,913 --> 00:56:05,905
Gertrude!

980
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:07,858
Mabel.

981
00:56:07,858 --> 00:56:10,705
I suddenly remembered
you were due to meet Arthur.

982
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:13,361
Oh,
at least somebody remembered.

983
00:56:13,361 --> 00:56:15,750
You mean he's not here either?

984
00:56:17,425 --> 00:56:18,766
Oh strange.

985
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:21,233
Gertrude, are you quite well?

986
00:56:21,233 --> 00:56:23,175
Me? Yes, of course

987
00:56:24,657 --> 00:56:26,566
No, I'm not at all.

988
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,061
Could we talk?

989
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:32,784
Everything I have ever learned,
indeed all that I believe,

990
00:56:32,784 --> 00:56:35,632
Ieads me to reject and revile
him for what he has done.

991
00:56:35,632 --> 00:56:36,720
And yet...

992
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,904
And yet?

993
00:56:37,904 --> 00:56:43,152
...I have never known such joy
as when I'm with him.

994
00:56:43,152 --> 00:56:45,648
I've never felt so...

995
00:56:45,648 --> 00:56:49,325
free as when I'm lying in his arms.

996
00:56:51,856 --> 00:56:54,736
Well, Arthur, I shall look out
for you at the Commons...

997
00:56:54,736 --> 00:56:57,168
where at least I'll see your friend
submit to my desires.

998
00:56:57,168 --> 00:56:58,703
I wouldn't be too sure.

999
00:56:58,703 --> 00:57:01,807
Come now, we both know how dearly
he values his career.

1000
00:57:01,807 --> 00:57:03,727
I look froward to him proving
you wrong I anticipate it keenly.

1001
00:57:03,727 --> 00:57:08,079
In fact, I'd stake my shirt on it.

1002
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,295
Your shirt?

1003
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:13,071
Indeed I think I'd probably
wager my entire wardrobe
on his integrity.

1004
00:57:13,071 --> 00:57:14,895
What confidence.

1005
00:57:14,895 --> 00:57:17,164
Would you stake your liberty?

1006
00:57:17,871 --> 00:57:19,278
My liberty?

1007
00:57:19,951 --> 00:57:22,671
A rather charming little idea
has sprung into my head...

1008
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:24,047
and now I consider it,

1009
00:57:24,047 --> 00:57:27,821
I discover it to be
a rather charming, big idea.

1010
00:57:28,335 --> 00:57:29,578
Go on.

1011
00:57:30,222 --> 00:57:34,286
If as you suggest,
he stands by his principles...

1012
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:37,358
condemns the scheme in question,
then shall I give you his letter.

1013
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:40,173
...to dispose of as you choose.

1014
00:57:40,173 --> 00:57:41,998
But if as I project...

1015
00:57:41,998 --> 00:57:45,581
he surrenders to my demands,
and publicly supports the scheme

1016
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:47,010
then...

1017
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:49,390
then shall I give you my hand
in marriage.

1018
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:50,670
Precisely.

1019
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:51,982
To dispose of as you please.

1020
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:55,693
As a better man, you must concede
there is a certain thrill to it.

1021
00:57:55,693 --> 00:58:01,101
Concede too how elegantly I've eased
from proposal to proposition.

1022
00:58:01,101 --> 00:58:04,109
And with barely any loss of face.
I'm most impressed indeed.

1023
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:07,109
We are creatures of compromise,
you and I.

1024
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:11,789
I await your response.
You're all of a sudden less
certain of your friend's true nature...

1025
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,658
when your own future
rests upon it.

1026
00:58:16,204 --> 00:58:19,405
Not at all I accept
your wager in all confidence.

1027
00:58:19,405 --> 00:58:21,037
You do?

1028
00:58:21,037 --> 00:58:22,412
I do.

1029
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:23,917
Oh, Arthur...

1030
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:27,943
isn't it remarkable
how those two little words
can quicken the heart?

1031
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:33,580
Would you do something for me,
Gertrude?

1032
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,532
Would you accompany me to
the House of Commons?

1033
00:58:35,532 --> 00:58:39,148
I believe there is a rather
interesting debate there tonight.

1034
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:42,731
I believe the Prime Minister
himself has taken an interest.

1035
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:45,068
And I believe...

1036
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:48,939
that its outcome will prove
particularly interesting to you.

1037
00:58:48,939 --> 00:58:50,368
And to me.

1038
00:58:52,075 --> 00:58:53,984
Whatever it may be.

1039
00:59:10,058 --> 00:59:11,106
Damn!

1040
00:59:30,186 --> 00:59:34,474
The Honourable Member
for Witney.

1041
00:59:34,474 --> 00:59:36,042
Good evening, Chiltern.

1042
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:37,705
Prime Minister.

1043
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:40,073
I beg to ask the President of
the Board of Trade...

1044
00:59:40,073 --> 00:59:44,106
to what extent he believes
the projected Argentine Canal...

1045
00:59:44,106 --> 00:59:47,684
merits the nation's attention
and support.

1046
00:59:48,937 --> 00:59:50,661
Mr. Speaker...

1047
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,545
I believe this excellent scheme...

1048
00:59:57,545 --> 01:00:00,457
represents a genuine opportunity...

1049
01:00:00,457 --> 01:00:02,281
to extend our trading routes...

1050
01:00:02,281 --> 01:00:06,921
and to stamp our authority
on an increasingly vital...

1051
01:00:06,921 --> 01:00:09,474
portion of the globe.

1052
01:00:14,632 --> 01:00:16,585
Didn't expect to see you here.

1053
01:00:16,585 --> 01:00:21,887
Nor did I But I find
I have developed a sudden and
very singular interest in politics.

1054
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:23,777
Married yet?

1055
01:00:24,296 --> 01:00:26,151
Ask me again in half an hour.

1056
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:30,504
What?

1057
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:31,336
Nothing.

1058
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,519
The Honourable Member
for Cheltenham.

1059
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:33,704
Arthur...?

1060
01:00:33,704 --> 01:00:36,519
I beg to ask the Under Secretary
for Foreign Affairs...

1061
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:41,159
to clarify his position
in respect to the proposed scheme.

1062
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:42,653
Answer.

1063
01:00:45,735 --> 01:00:47,783
Let me first of all thank the...

1064
01:00:47,783 --> 01:00:51,841
Honourable Member for his articulate
contribution to the debate.

1065
01:00:53,895 --> 01:00:57,735
Since I last opportunity
to investigate this scheme...

1066
01:00:57,735 --> 01:01:00,679
I have had the opportunity
to investigate this scheme...

1067
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:02,567
more thoroughly...

1068
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:07,869
and to grasp fully the ramifications
of our lending it support.

1069
01:01:10,214 --> 01:01:13,149
I have to inform the House...

1070
01:01:13,638 --> 01:01:15,525
that I was...

1071
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,506
mistaken...

1072
01:01:18,566 --> 01:01:20,933
in my original perceptions...

1073
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,870
and that I have now taken
a rather different view.

1074
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,973
I, I find that now
I must agree with...

1075
01:01:39,973 --> 01:01:45,925
my Right Honourable Friend that
this is indeed an excellent scheme.

1076
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:49,088
A genuine...opportunity.

1077
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,189
An opportunity...

1078
01:01:53,189 --> 01:01:56,833
particularly if you happen
to be a corrupt investor...

1079
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:03,620
a corrupt investor...

1080
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:07,482
with nothing but self-interest
at heart.

1081
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:13,636
For now it is my utter conviction
that this scheme never should have had...

1082
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:17,252
or should ever have
any chance of success.

1083
01:02:17,252 --> 01:02:20,708
It is a fraud
an infamous fraud at that.

1084
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:25,726
Our involvement would be
a political fraud of
the worst possible kind.

1085
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:32,355
This great nation...

1086
01:02:32,355 --> 01:02:35,428
has long been
a great commercial power.

1087
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:39,843
Now it seems there exists
a growing compulsion to
use that power...

1088
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:42,403
merely to beget more power.

1089
01:02:42,403 --> 01:02:46,691
Money merely to beget
more money...

1090
01:02:46,691 --> 01:02:50,563
irrespective of the true
cost to the nation's soul.

1091
01:02:50,563 --> 01:02:54,242
And it is this sickness,
a kind of moral blindness...

1092
01:02:54,242 --> 01:03:00,322
...commerce without conscience,
which threatens to strike
at the very soul of this nation.

1093
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:04,251
And the only remedy that
I can see is to strike back and
to strike now!

1094
01:03:06,722 --> 01:03:11,807
Hear, hear!

1095
01:03:14,114 --> 01:03:18,658
As we stand as we stand
at the end of this most...

1096
01:03:18,658 --> 01:03:21,186
eventful century...

1097
01:03:21,186 --> 01:03:24,353
it seems that we do,
after all, have...

1098
01:03:24,353 --> 01:03:26,529
...a genuine opportunity.

1099
01:03:26,529 --> 01:03:30,689
One honest chance to shed our...

1100
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:34,017
sometimes imperfect past...

1101
01:03:34,017 --> 01:03:35,841
to start again...

1102
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:39,649
to step unshackled
into the next century...

1103
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:43,904
and to look our future squarely...

1104
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:47,734
and proudly in the face.

1105
01:03:50,305 --> 01:03:54,298
Order!

1106
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,134
Gentlemen, if you please! Order!

1107
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:02,779
Order!

1108
01:04:11,072 --> 01:04:14,400
You must agree,
it has been a romantic interlude,
Arthur.

1109
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:19,582
You might even confess to
some faint and secret regret
at its outcome.

1110
01:04:19,871 --> 01:04:23,552
For I do indeed feel some slight
relief that in the end...

1111
01:04:23,552 --> 01:04:24,671
...Sir Robert has come to no harm.

1112
01:04:24,671 --> 01:04:25,824
Really?

1113
01:04:25,824 --> 01:04:30,143
Oh yes, you see I'm not
really quite as wicked
as you suppose.

1114
01:04:30,143 --> 01:04:31,550
Mrs. Cheveley!

1115
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:35,385
And a lady must always honour
her bets.

1116
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:38,200
Come back with me, Arthur.

1117
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,998
Come back to Vienna.

1118
01:04:44,959 --> 01:04:47,039
Bravo, Sir Robert.

1119
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:48,926
Seems I underestimated you.

1120
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:49,598
Robert.

1121
01:04:49,598 --> 01:04:51,391
I'm sorry if I've spoiled
your plans.

1122
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:52,830
Far more than yet you realize.

1123
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,814
Ah, there at least is
some small satisfaction.

1124
01:04:54,814 --> 01:04:56,254
Look, Robert, my dear fellow...

1125
01:04:56,254 --> 01:04:58,261
I have nothing to say to you,
Lord Goring.

1126
01:04:58,942 --> 01:05:01,081
Nor is there anything
I wish to hear.

1127
01:05:13,885 --> 01:05:17,180
I hope that now you are content...

1128
01:05:17,469 --> 01:05:19,582
that I didn't disappoint you.

1129
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:20,509
Robert, I...

1130
01:05:20,509 --> 01:05:22,974
Let women make
no more ideals of men...

1131
01:05:22,974 --> 01:05:26,429
or they may ruin other lives
as completely as you.

1132
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:29,085
You whom I have loved
so wildly...

1133
01:05:29,085 --> 01:05:31,293
have surely ruined mine.

1134
01:05:31,293 --> 01:05:32,602
Robert...

1135
01:05:33,725 --> 01:05:36,092
I know there is no hope for us now.

1136
01:05:37,405 --> 01:05:39,641
I know you can never forgive me.

1137
01:05:41,853 --> 01:05:45,532
Poor man I almost begin
to feel sorry for him.

1138
01:05:45,532 --> 01:05:46,653
Sorry?

1139
01:05:46,653 --> 01:05:50,972
Yes, I can't bear to see
so upright a gentleman,
so honourable an English gentleman...

1140
01:05:50,972 --> 01:05:53,212
being so shamefully deceived.

1141
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:54,300
Deceived?

1142
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,892
And on such positively pink paper.

1143
01:05:56,892 --> 01:05:58,780
What are you talking about,
Mrs. Cheveley?

1144
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:02,260
"I need you after all
I'm coming to you now."

1145
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:05,723
You stole Gertrude's letter?

1146
01:06:05,723 --> 01:06:08,540
Losing a man is scant cause
for concern...

1147
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,843
but losing a man to her is
another matter entirely.

1148
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:14,427
And so I feel it only right that
Sir Robert should know,
as indeed he shall...

1149
01:06:14,427 --> 01:06:18,737
when the letter arrives at
his office first thing in the morning.

1150
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:23,547
You've got a good man there,
Gertrude.

1151
01:06:23,547 --> 01:06:25,467
You should try to hold on to him.

1152
01:06:25,467 --> 01:06:26,395
Do you know, Laura...

1153
01:06:26,395 --> 01:06:30,453
it occurs to me this whole business
is really just about you and me.

1154
01:06:35,546 --> 01:06:36,923
Gertrude, I must speak with you.

1155
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:38,907
Er, er, not now. Arthur.
Please!

1156
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:41,818
Gertrude, it's about that letter.
The letter you wrote to me!

1157
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:43,923
...do come round in the morning,
Arthur, I can't talk now.

1158
01:06:45,115 --> 01:06:46,456
Lord Goring?

1159
01:06:49,274 --> 01:06:50,386
Miss Mabel...

1160
01:06:50,714 --> 01:06:51,770
about this evening, I...

1161
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:53,297
congratulations.

1162
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:55,674
I beg your pardon?

1163
01:06:55,674 --> 01:06:57,626
I gather you are to
be congratulated.

1164
01:06:57,626 --> 01:07:01,145
Well naturally...there's nothing
I like more than to be congratulated...

1165
01:07:01,145 --> 01:07:05,690
though invariably
I find the pleasure immeasurably
increased by knowing what for.

1166
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:09,018
Oh, haven't you heard?
You're to be married.

1167
01:07:09,018 --> 01:07:10,105
Your father says...

1168
01:07:10,105 --> 01:07:10,969
Does he?

1169
01:07:10,969 --> 01:07:12,530
Yes, he does.

1170
01:07:13,689 --> 01:07:16,144
Did he, by any chance,
tell you to who?

1171
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:18,009
No.

1172
01:07:18,009 --> 01:07:20,313
But when we saw you with
that woman Mrs. Cheeseley

1173
01:07:20,313 --> 01:07:21,561
we naturally assumed...

1174
01:07:21,561 --> 01:07:22,425
Oh, did we?

1175
01:07:22,425 --> 01:07:24,409
Yes, we did.

1176
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:26,841
Well the fact is...

1177
01:07:26,841 --> 01:07:29,944
your assumptions
are presumptuous.

1178
01:07:29,944 --> 01:07:31,668
You see...

1179
01:07:32,857 --> 01:07:35,801
I'm not sure...

1180
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:38,904
that I've seen anything
I quite like the look of yet.

1181
01:07:38,904 --> 01:07:40,408
Oh, really?

1182
01:07:40,408 --> 01:07:42,928
Mum, really.

1183
01:07:43,256 --> 01:07:47,118
In which case I have something
vitally important to say to you.

1184
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:54,037
To look at a thing is quite
different form seeing a thing.

1185
01:07:54,455 --> 01:07:59,758
And one does not see anything
until one sees its beauty.

1186
01:08:01,687 --> 01:08:04,273
Yes. Really.

1187
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,099
Oh, Mabel

1188
01:08:12,695 --> 01:08:16,721
Do you have something you wish
to say to me, Lord Goring?

1189
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:25,238
...no, no I don't think so.

1190
01:08:29,622 --> 01:08:31,924
Then I don't wish to hear it.

1191
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:33,270
Goodnight.

1192
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:34,007
Goodnight.

1193
01:08:34,007 --> 01:08:37,270
I'm sure that nice Mr. Trafford
will have something to say to me.

1194
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:38,994
And I'm even surer...

1195
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:42,027
I will be quite charmed to listen!

1196
01:08:49,398 --> 01:08:50,161
Damn!

1197
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:01,968
It is a great nuisance.

1198
01:09:04,629 --> 01:09:11,317
Can't find anyone else to talk to
and I'm so full of
interesting information.

1199
01:09:11,317 --> 01:09:13,172
I feel like the latest
edition of something or other.

1200
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:14,738
Well...

1201
01:09:15,221 --> 01:09:17,425
after some consideration...

1202
01:09:18,133 --> 01:09:19,892
there's so much to do

1203
01:09:19,892 --> 01:09:22,281
there's only one thing to be done.

1204
01:09:23,892 --> 01:09:28,180
There comes a time in every
son's life when he must, indeed...

1205
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:30,766
follow his father's advice.

1206
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,256
I shall go to bed at once.

1207
01:09:37,652 --> 01:09:41,332
I do hope we see you in the near
future, Mrs. Cheveley.

1208
01:09:41,332 --> 01:09:44,308
Oh, so do I. But I fear,
Lady Markby, that for me...

1209
01:09:44,308 --> 01:09:46,740
the future seems
strangely uncertain.

1210
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,947
And what of the present?

1211
01:09:48,947 --> 01:09:50,068
And what of the present?

1212
01:09:50,068 --> 01:09:52,019
Well, as a very dear friend once said
to me, "To love oneself...

1213
01:09:52,019 --> 01:09:54,771
is the beginning of
a lifelong romance".

1214
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:56,659
Goodbye, dear Lady Markby.

1215
01:10:00,307 --> 01:10:03,187
London will be the lesser
for your leaving.

1216
01:10:03,187 --> 01:10:05,875
And sadly lacking in scandal.

1217
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:07,443
Ah, but my dear Lady Markby...

1218
01:10:07,443 --> 01:10:10,675
my personal favourite
is shortly to unfold.

1219
01:10:10,675 --> 01:10:12,169
Consider it a parting gift.

1220
01:10:12,819 --> 01:10:14,226
Thank you, Mrs. Cheveley.

1221
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:53,904
May I see it?

1222
01:11:05,617 --> 01:11:10,734
...that is what you were doing
with that woman, Mrs. Cheveley.

1223
01:11:13,616 --> 01:11:15,569
Well it certainly
didn't look that way.

1224
01:11:15,569 --> 01:11:16,273
Ah yes,

1225
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:20,713
but there's a great deal of
difference between looking and seeing
Isn't there, Miss Mabel?

1226
01:11:23,921 --> 01:11:25,895
Oh, my dear Arthur.

1227
01:11:26,832 --> 01:11:29,582
What a good friend you are
to him.

1228
01:11:29,872 --> 01:11:31,216
To us.

1229
01:11:31,216 --> 01:11:34,032
But the truth is we, re not out of
danger yet. In fact...

1230
01:11:34,032 --> 01:11:37,967
I believe there's a rather
popular saying about
frying pans and fires...

1231
01:11:37,967 --> 01:11:41,764
only this time it is you and I,
dear Gertrude,
who are to be roasted.

1232
01:11:45,711 --> 01:11:47,567
Oh no, Arthur, I, I couldn't.

1233
01:11:47,567 --> 01:11:48,175
No, I couldn't.

1234
01:11:48,175 --> 01:11:50,384
I think it is better that
he should know the exact truth.

1235
01:11:50,384 --> 01:11:54,191
So you want me to tell him that
what?

1236
01:11:54,191 --> 01:11:57,039
That I intended a...

1237
01:11:57,039 --> 01:11:57,647
secret...

1238
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:58,959
a secret rendezvous. Yes.

1239
01:11:58,959 --> 01:12:00,879
With a single man?
And at such an hour?

1240
01:12:00,879 --> 01:12:02,574
You, you want me to tell him that?

1241
01:12:02,574 --> 01:12:04,111
It's scandalous, Arthur!

1242
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,726
Well that may be but it's also
the truth and in this case
it may be our best option.

1243
01:12:07,726 --> 01:12:10,031
But I'm a married woman.
I couldn't possibly tell him.

1244
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:11,022
Well then, may I do it?

1245
01:12:11,022 --> 01:12:12,590
Certainly not!

1246
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:15,662
And you must give me your word,
Arthur, that you never will.

1247
01:12:15,662 --> 01:12:17,189
No, you are wrong, Gertrude!

1248
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:21,390
But I will give you my word.

1249
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:24,142
That you will never tell me what...

1250
01:12:24,142 --> 01:12:25,484
Lord Goring?

1251
01:12:26,126 --> 01:12:27,206
Robert.

1252
01:12:32,078 --> 01:12:33,572
What does this mean?

1253
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:41,422
I, Robert, I, I meant to give
it to you last night But...

1254
01:12:41,422 --> 01:12:42,632
Last night?

1255
01:12:44,302 --> 01:12:47,693
Yes, when Gertrude sent it
over but you left
in such a hurry...

1256
01:12:47,693 --> 01:12:49,325
Oh, then, then...

1257
01:12:49,325 --> 01:12:51,267
so this letter is intended
for me?

1258
01:12:57,581 --> 01:12:59,085
Well, of co...

1259
01:12:59,085 --> 01:12:59,820
oh my goodness...

1260
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:02,373
you didn't think, you couldn't
possibly think that, you know...

1261
01:13:04,364 --> 01:13:06,284
The name, the, um...

1262
01:13:06,284 --> 01:13:09,186
the address on the envelope
is yours...

1263
01:13:09,932 --> 01:13:13,036
She knew that when you left
here you would come to me at once,
obviously.

1264
01:13:13,036 --> 01:13:15,076
Well, it stands to reason old man,
come on.

1265
01:13:18,348 --> 01:13:20,172
It's true, Robert.

1266
01:13:20,172 --> 01:13:21,995
I delivered it myself.

1267
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:28,171
You did? You did.

1268
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:29,698
Certainly.

1269
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:37,163
As you will remember, Gertrude
after my rehearsals
I called in for tea.

1270
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,691
And, when you mentioned
the letter...

1271
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:43,212
I remarked that I was shortly
to meet up with Lord Goring as
we had an appointment...

1272
01:13:43,212 --> 01:13:45,740
to visit the new Modern Art
exhibition at the Grosvenor...

1273
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:48,619
which Quite frankly,
apart from two studies in grey

1274
01:13:48,619 --> 01:13:50,699
by whistler,
was exceedingly forgettable.

1275
01:13:50,699 --> 01:13:53,259
And that's exactly what
lord goring then proceeded to do.

1276
01:13:53,259 --> 01:13:56,171
Namely forget it...
before he even saw it.

1277
01:13:56,171 --> 01:13:58,821
For, you see, he never appeared.

1278
01:13:59,115 --> 01:14:03,754
A fact which I find most upsetting,
both on behalf of myself
and Mr. Whistler.

1279
01:14:03,754 --> 01:14:06,143
And we're both deciding whether
or not to forgive him.

1280
01:14:06,634 --> 01:14:11,391
In the meantime
I delivered the letter myself
to your office this morning.

1281
01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:14,538
And you know
the fact of the matter is...

1282
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:17,386
I still haven't heard
a word of apology!

1283
01:14:17,738 --> 01:14:20,682
Umm. Sorry.

1284
01:14:20,682 --> 01:14:22,570
I forgive you.

1285
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:23,977
Thank you.

1286
01:14:24,778 --> 01:14:26,022
Is this true?

1287
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:43,433
"When you left...

1288
01:14:43,433 --> 01:14:45,572
my life...

1289
01:14:46,409 --> 01:14:49,725
my life fell apart."

1290
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,157
"I need you after all."

1291
01:14:55,113 --> 01:14:58,015
Your life fell apart, Gertrude?

1292
01:15:02,281 --> 01:15:03,557
Yes.

1293
01:15:07,304 --> 01:15:09,955
You, you need me, Gertrude?

1294
01:15:11,496 --> 01:15:13,096
Yes.

1295
01:15:13,096 --> 01:15:15,976
Why did you not say
that you loved me?

1296
01:15:15,976 --> 01:15:17,951
Oh, because I love you!

1297
01:15:19,719 --> 01:15:21,864
I, I do not care what...

1298
01:15:21,864 --> 01:15:24,839
what punishment or disgrace
is in store for me.

1299
01:15:24,839 --> 01:15:26,792
This letter of yours, Gertrude...

1300
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:31,303
makes me feel that nothing that the
world can do can harm me now.

1301
01:15:31,303 --> 01:15:35,459
There's no disgrace in store for you,
nor any public shame.

1302
01:15:39,975 --> 01:15:42,919
I...

1303
01:15:42,919 --> 01:15:44,071
I, I don't understand.

1304
01:15:44,071 --> 01:15:47,420
We have much to thank him for,
Robert.

1305
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:51,143
When I finished
my speech last night, I...

1306
01:15:51,143 --> 01:15:53,959
felt sure that
my future was in ruins.

1307
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:55,998
And when you began it
I wasn't so sure about my own.

1308
01:15:56,454 --> 01:15:58,429
I don't know how to thank you.

1309
01:16:00,614 --> 01:16:02,240
I'm sure I'll think of something.

1310
01:16:03,623 --> 01:16:07,452
Er, in the meantime I'd be
grateful for the return of my hand.

1311
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:13,437
Miss Mabel.

1312
01:16:17,894 --> 01:16:19,235
Miss Mabel.

1313
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,280
Miss Mabel, wait.

1314
01:16:25,573 --> 01:16:27,712
I, Er...

1315
01:16:27,941 --> 01:16:31,333
I have something
very particular to say to you.

1316
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:32,860
Is it a proposal?

1317
01:16:34,725 --> 01:16:37,627
Well. Yes, it is.

1318
01:16:38,661 --> 01:16:40,188
It is?

1319
01:16:42,213 --> 01:16:44,068
I, I think it is.

1320
01:16:44,325 --> 01:16:45,885
Well yes or no?

1321
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:47,205
Well, actuarially, yes

1322
01:16:47,205 --> 01:16:48,869
I'm afraid it is.

1323
01:16:48,869 --> 01:16:49,893
I'm so glad.

1324
01:16:49,893 --> 01:16:51,973
That makes the second one
today.

1325
01:16:51,973 --> 01:16:53,156
What?

1326
01:16:53,156 --> 01:16:53,989
Oh dear, not...?

1327
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:55,588
Yes...Tommy Trafford.

1328
01:16:55,588 --> 01:16:57,477
It is one of Tommy's days
for proposing.

1329
01:16:57,477 --> 01:17:00,740
He always proposes on Tursdays
during the season.

1330
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:03,140
Ah...but today is Friday.

1331
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,100
I know.

1332
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,627
Today is special.

1333
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:10,169
Well, you didn't accept him,
did you?

1334
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:14,238
I shall be in the conservatory
under the second palm tree
on the right.

1335
01:17:16,676 --> 01:17:18,340
The second palm tree
on the right?

1336
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:21,656
The usual palm tree.

1337
01:17:21,891 --> 01:17:23,549
And then we'll see how you do.

1338
01:17:24,675 --> 01:17:25,657
The usual?

1339
01:17:28,067 --> 01:17:29,627
Well, sir,
what are you doing here?

1340
01:17:30,307 --> 01:17:32,827
Wasting your time as usual.

1341
01:17:33,699 --> 01:17:35,971
My dear father...
when one pays a visit...

1342
01:17:35,971 --> 01:17:38,691
it is for the purpose of
wasting other people's time and
not one's own.

1343
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:39,747
What are you doing here?

1344
01:17:39,747 --> 01:17:41,754
I've important news for Chiltern.

1345
01:17:44,898 --> 01:17:46,306
A seat in the Cabinet.

1346
01:17:46,306 --> 01:17:48,290
Certainly,
and you well deserve it too.

1347
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:50,723
You have got what we want
so much in policical life nowadays...

1348
01:17:50,723 --> 01:17:54,050
high character high moral tone

1349
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:57,399
Everything that you have not got, sir,
and never will have.

1350
01:18:08,546 --> 01:18:12,986
I...cannot accept this offer,
Lord Caversham.

1351
01:18:13,762 --> 01:18:15,938
I have decided to decline it.

1352
01:18:15,938 --> 01:18:17,793
Decline it, sir?

1353
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:20,386
It is my intention to retire
at once from public life.

1354
01:18:20,386 --> 01:18:23,905
Decline a seat in the Cabinet
and retire from public life?

1355
01:18:23,905 --> 01:18:27,649
I never heard
such damned nonsense
in the whole course of my existence!

1356
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:29,953
Oh, I beg your pardon,
lady Chiltern.

1357
01:18:29,953 --> 01:18:32,832
Will you kindly prevent
your husband from making such a...

1358
01:18:32,832 --> 01:18:36,280
I think my husband is right,
Lord Caversham. I agree with him.

1359
01:18:36,801 --> 01:18:38,657
You agree? Good heavens.

1360
01:18:38,657 --> 01:18:40,860
I admire him for it.

1361
01:18:41,089 --> 01:18:43,772
I admire him immensely for it.

1362
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:49,174
I shall write at once to
the Prime Minister.

1363
01:18:50,784 --> 01:18:52,672
If you'll excuse me for a moment,
Lord Caversham.

1364
01:18:52,672 --> 01:18:54,265
Lord Caversham.

1365
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,482
What is the matter
with this family?

1366
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,112
There's something wrong here...eh?

1367
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:06,422
Idiocy. Hereditary perhaps...
Both of them too.

1368
01:19:06,912 --> 01:19:09,279
Very sad. Very sad indeed.

1369
01:19:09,856 --> 01:19:12,507
They're not an old family.

1370
01:19:12,767 --> 01:19:14,076
I can't understand it.

1371
01:19:15,135 --> 01:19:18,367
Oh well, suppose I'd better
go back to the Prime Minister
and tell him

1372
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:19,839
Chiltern's the damnedest fool I ever
met and won't take the seat.

1373
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:23,103
Oh no, father,
I would rather you did not quite.
I'd rather you,took a seat yourself?

1374
01:19:23,103 --> 01:19:24,959
Why are you prating about?

1375
01:19:24,959 --> 01:19:27,231
Why don't you go in there
for a while, father, hmm?

1376
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,047
The second palm tree to the right,
The usual palm.

1377
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:30,911
What?

1378
01:19:30,911 --> 01:19:32,671
There's somebody
I want you to talk to.

1379
01:19:32,671 --> 01:19:33,662
What about?

1380
01:19:33,662 --> 01:19:34,686
About me, sir.

1381
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:35,864
Hmmm?

1382
01:19:36,927 --> 01:19:39,960
Not a subject on which
much eloquence is possible.

1383
01:19:47,102 --> 01:19:48,084
Gertrude.

1384
01:19:54,174 --> 01:19:59,133
Yes, Arthur, it is Robert himself
who wishes to retire
from public life.

1385
01:19:59,133 --> 01:19:59,710
Really.

1386
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:00,701
It was he who first said so.

1387
01:20:00,701 --> 01:20:02,590
Rather than lose your love
he would do anything

1388
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,285
Has he not been punished enough?

1389
01:20:04,285 --> 01:20:06,269
We've both been punished.

1390
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,797
I set him up too high.

1391
01:20:08,797 --> 01:20:11,005
Do not then set him down
now too low.

1392
01:20:11,005 --> 01:20:14,780
Dear Gertrude,
it is not the perfect but
the imperfect who have need of love.

1393
01:20:15,549 --> 01:20:18,173
You seem to know a great deal
about everything all of a sudden.

1394
01:20:18,173 --> 01:20:21,309
I hope not.

1395
01:20:21,309 --> 01:20:23,197
All I do know...

1396
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:25,469
is that is takes great
courage to see the world

1397
01:20:25,469 --> 01:20:28,797
in all its tainted glory
and still to love it.

1398
01:20:28,797 --> 01:20:31,868
And even more courage to
see it in the one you love.

1399
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:35,356
Dear Gertrude you have more courage
than any woman I know.

1400
01:20:35,356 --> 01:20:38,323
Do not be afraid to use it.

1401
01:20:59,003 --> 01:21:00,792
Well Lady Caversham
need never know.

1402
01:21:02,747 --> 01:21:03,762
Thank you, father.

1403
01:21:04,155 --> 01:21:05,691
Can't say I hold up
much hope, old man.

1404
01:21:05,691 --> 01:21:06,619
What?

1405
01:21:35,034 --> 01:21:36,016
Lord Goring?

1406
01:21:37,946 --> 01:21:40,280
You have something
you wish to say to me?

1407
01:21:43,994 --> 01:21:45,456
Marry me, M...

1408
01:21:50,362 --> 01:21:52,217
Marry me, Miss Mabel.

1409
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:56,826
Well...Lord Goring...

1410
01:21:56,826 --> 01:21:59,444
I must say this comes
as quite a surprise.

1411
01:22:00,922 --> 01:22:02,746
Well, if you need time
to consider, I'll just...

1412
01:22:02,746 --> 01:22:03,449
No.

1413
01:22:03,449 --> 01:22:06,201
No, I don't need time,
I need a reason.

1414
01:22:06,201 --> 01:22:07,281
What?

1415
01:22:08,058 --> 01:22:11,832
A reason why you think
I should marry you.

1416
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:15,349
Oh, umm...

1417
01:22:20,729 --> 01:22:21,977
A reason you say?

1418
01:22:21,977 --> 01:22:23,503
A good one...yes.

1419
01:22:24,665 --> 01:22:25,428
Robert.

1420
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:30,285
May I?

1421
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,276
Of course.

1422
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:40,888
Gertrude.

1423
01:22:40,888 --> 01:22:43,987
It is more than enough
to know that you would
sacrifice it when I asked.

1424
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:48,951
We have, all of us,
feet of clay, Robert.

1425
01:22:48,951 --> 01:22:51,407
Women as well as men.

1426
01:22:54,424 --> 01:22:56,246
Can it be that...

1427
01:22:57,016 --> 01:22:59,317
That you've forgiven me?

1428
01:23:01,399 --> 01:23:04,181
I sup...
I suppose it must be that.

1429
01:23:05,623 --> 01:23:07,761
Oh goodness.

1430
01:23:08,855 --> 01:23:10,611
Hold me, Robert.

1431
01:23:14,839 --> 01:23:16,567
Forgive me.

1432
01:23:16,567 --> 01:23:18,476
Gertrude.

1433
01:23:19,926 --> 01:23:25,393
Gertrude, my wife.

1434
01:23:33,046 --> 01:23:34,006
I love you.

1435
01:23:34,006 --> 01:23:35,696
I love you.

1436
01:23:36,758 --> 01:23:38,481
I love you.

1437
01:23:40,342 --> 01:23:42,006
Is that your reason?

1438
01:23:42,006 --> 01:23:44,045
Hmm.

1439
01:23:44,438 --> 01:23:47,023
I love you.

1440
01:23:48,021 --> 01:23:49,142
I said

1441
01:23:49,142 --> 01:23:50,037
Mabel I said...

1442
01:23:50,037 --> 01:23:51,892
I, I know.

1443
01:23:52,245 --> 01:23:53,936
Well...

1444
01:23:54,421 --> 01:23:55,915
Couldn't you...

1445
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:59,308
Love me just
a little bit in return?

1446
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:04,107
Arthur... you silly...

1447
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:07,381
If you knew anything
about anything...
which you don't...

1448
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:12,148
You'd know that
I absolutely adore you.

1449
01:24:12,148 --> 01:24:13,642
Really?

1450
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:18,129
Well...why didn't you
mention it before?

1451
01:24:18,965 --> 01:24:21,812
Because...dear boy...

1452
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,365
You never would
have believed me.

1453
01:24:50,675 --> 01:24:52,530
What the devil's going on
in this house?

1454
01:24:59,571 --> 01:25:01,171
Congratulations!

1455
01:25:01,171 --> 01:25:04,979
If the country doesn't go to
the dogs or the radicals
we'll have you prime Minister!

1456
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:06,003
Thank you, Lord Caversham.

1457
01:25:06,003 --> 01:25:09,523
And Arthur...I only wish there was
something I could do to repay you.

1458
01:25:09,523 --> 01:25:12,457
Well, Robert...
as a matter of fact there is.

1459
01:25:13,106 --> 01:25:15,506
You are your sister's guardian.

1460
01:25:15,506 --> 01:25:17,523
I should like your consent
to our marriage, that is all.

1461
01:25:17,523 --> 01:25:19,443
Oh, I'm so glad.

1462
01:25:19,443 --> 01:25:20,850
You wish to marry Mabel?

1463
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:21,906
Yes.

1464
01:25:21,906 --> 01:25:24,906
I'm sorry, Arthur, but the thing
is quite out of the question.

1465
01:25:25,426 --> 01:25:26,440
Oh, Robert.

1466
01:25:26,802 --> 01:25:30,962
No, I have to consider
Mabel's future happiness and as...

1467
01:25:30,962 --> 01:25:33,362
Much as I care for you, Arthur...

1468
01:25:33,362 --> 01:25:36,433
I don't think her happiness
would be safe in your hands.

1469
01:25:36,433 --> 01:25:37,937
But I love Mabel.

1470
01:25:37,937 --> 01:25:39,563
No other woman has a place
in heart.

1471
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:43,243
Darling, if they truly
love each other,
why should they not be married?

1472
01:25:45,617 --> 01:25:46,893
I shall tell you.

1473
01:25:47,953 --> 01:25:50,001
When I called on Lord Goring.

1474
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:52,657
Yesterday evening I found Mrs.
Cheverley concealed in his rooms.

1475
01:25:52,657 --> 01:25:56,551
I then discovered...
that they were at one time engaged
to be married.

1476
01:25:57,265 --> 01:25:58,759
I'm very sorry, Mabel...

1477
01:25:59,472 --> 01:26:02,513
but how can I possibly
allow you to marry him when...

1478
01:26:02,513 --> 01:26:04,945
when he's involved
with another woman?

1479
01:26:04,945 --> 01:26:06,188
I'm sorry, Arthur.

1480
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,389
It would be wrong of me.

1481
01:26:10,288 --> 01:26:13,550
It would be unjust to her.

1482
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:23,376
Very well.

1483
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:24,456
But, Arthur...

1484
01:26:25,616 --> 01:26:26,663
Mabel...

1485
01:26:29,296 --> 01:26:31,205
there is nothing I can say.

1486
01:26:38,704 --> 01:26:39,597
Robert.

1487
01:26:44,463 --> 01:26:47,407
Arthur was as surprised as you...

1488
01:26:47,407 --> 01:26:50,542
to find Mrs. Cheveley
in his rooms last night.

1489
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:53,063
He was expecting...

1490
01:26:54,382 --> 01:26:56,204
quite another woman.

1491
01:26:56,718 --> 01:27:00,558
Another woman?
What d'you mean?

1492
01:27:00,558 --> 01:27:02,447
Well, the truth is...

1493
01:27:02,447 --> 01:27:05,358
The business about Mabel and,
Er, Mr. Whistler, well...

1494
01:27:05,358 --> 01:27:07,950
you see that was just...

1495
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:13,327
my friends being kind,
and, umm... protecting me.

1496
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:16,078
Er well, the truth is...

1497
01:27:16,078 --> 01:27:20,686
when I agreed to the story about
the letter being intended
for you and...

1498
01:27:20,686 --> 01:27:24,590
not for Arthur well y...

1499
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:25,869
you see...

1500
01:27:25,869 --> 01:27:28,291
the truth is...

1501
01:27:31,662 --> 01:27:36,135
the truth is...

1502
01:27:37,613 --> 01:27:39,174
I lied!

1503
01:27:43,757 --> 01:27:44,934
Bravo.

1504
01:27:50,797 --> 01:27:52,291
Father!

1505
01:28:05,932 --> 01:28:06,892
I need a drink.

1506
01:28:06,892 --> 01:28:07,840
Me too.

1507
01:28:28,427 --> 01:28:31,788
And if you don't make
her an ideal husband,
I'll cut you off with a shilling.

1508
01:28:31,788 --> 01:28:35,399
An ideal husband. I don't think
I should like that.

1509
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:38,251
What do you want him
to be then, my dear?

1510
01:28:38,251 --> 01:28:40,779
I think he can be whatever
he chooses.

1511
01:28:40,779 --> 01:28:42,443
You don't deserve her, sir.

1512
01:28:42,443 --> 01:28:46,250
My dear father, if we men
married the women we deserved...

1513
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:48,843
we should have
a very bad time of it.

1514
01:28:48,843 --> 01:28:52,010
You're heartless, sir,
quite heartless.

1515
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:54,378
Oh, I hope not, sir.

1516
01:28:54,378 --> 01:28:56,287
I hope not.
