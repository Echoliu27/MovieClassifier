Ha ha ha!

977
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:11,966
I'm sorry. Am l...

978
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:13,403
l am, um...

979
00:56:13,439 --> 00:56:17,068
My name is, uh...

980
00:56:18,578 --> 00:56:21,240
[Cuckoo cuckoo]

981
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,680
B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.

982
00:56:23,716 --> 00:56:26,412
Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.

983
00:56:26,452 --> 00:56:28,079
-And you are?
-Jim.

984
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:29,645
Oh, what a pleasure
to meet you, Jimmy.

985
00:56:29,689 --> 00:56:31,919
-It's Jim.
-Anyway...

986
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,425
Look, I'm kind of
in a hurry, OK?

987
00:56:33,459 --> 00:56:36,053
l got to find a place to hide,
and there's pirates chasing me.

988
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,292
Oh, pirates!
Don't get me started on pirates!

989
00:56:39,332 --> 00:56:42,392
l don't like them.
l remember Captain Flint.

990
00:56:42,435 --> 00:56:44,699
This guy had such a temper.

991
00:56:44,737 --> 00:56:46,830
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint?

992
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:49,808
l think he suffered
from mood swings, personally.

993
00:56:49,842 --> 00:56:51,605
I'm not a therapist,
and anyway...

994
00:56:51,644 --> 00:56:53,771
but l--you let me know
when I'm rambling.

995
00:56:53,813 --> 00:56:55,144
But that means--but wait.

996
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:57,547
But then you gotta know
about the treasure?

997
00:56:57,583 --> 00:56:59,244
-Treasure?
-Yeah, Flint's trove?

998
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:01,253
You know,
loot of a thousand worlds.

999
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:03,221
It's--well, it's...

1000
00:57:03,256 --> 00:57:06,783
it's all a little--
little--little fuzzy.

1001
00:57:06,826 --> 00:57:10,421
Wait. l--l r-r-remember.

1002
00:57:10,463 --> 00:57:12,522
l do. l--treasure!

1003
00:57:12,565 --> 00:57:15,466
Lots of treasure
buried in the centroid--

1004
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:17,526
centroid--centroid
of the mechanism.

1005
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:20,835
And there was this big door
opening and closing...

1006
00:57:20,873 --> 00:57:22,898
and opening and closing...

1007
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:24,534
and Captain Flint
wanted to make sure...

1008
00:57:24,577 --> 00:57:26,169
nobody could ever
get to his treasure...

1009
00:57:26,212 --> 00:57:29,204
so I helped him...
[Sputtering]

1010
00:57:29,248 --> 00:57:31,808
Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!

1011
00:57:31,851 --> 00:57:34,046
JIM: BEN ? BEN ? BEN !

1012
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:36,680
Reboot! Aah! And you are?

1013
00:57:36,722 --> 00:57:38,087
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure?

1014
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:39,557
l want to say Larry.

1015
00:57:39,592 --> 00:57:41,753
The--the centroid
of the mechanism, or--

1016
00:57:41,794 --> 00:57:44,957
I'm sorry. My memory
isn't what it used to be.

1017
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:45,064
l've lost my mind. Ha ha!
l've lost my mind.

1018
00:57:45,064 --> 00:57:48,090
l've lost my mind. Ha ha!
l've lost my mind.

1019
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:49,567
You haven't found it, have you?

1020
00:57:49,602 --> 00:57:53,299
Uh, my missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?

1021
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:57,867
Look, B.E.N., I really need
to find a place to hide, OK?

1022
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,937
So I'm just gonna be,
you know, moving on.

1023
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:05,439
Oh, uh, so, well, then...

1024
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:09,353
l guess, uh...
this is good-bye, huh?

1025
00:58:09,388 --> 00:58:14,291
I'm sorry that
I'm so dysfunctional.

1026
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:19,355
So, uh, go ahead and...
l do understand.

1027
00:58:19,398 --> 00:58:22,856
l do. Bye-bye.

1028
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,970
[Whines]

1029
00:58:26,005 --> 00:58:28,473
[Sighs] Look,
if you're gonna come along...

1030
00:58:28,508 --> 00:58:30,203
you're gonna have
to stop talking.

1031
00:58:30,243 --> 00:58:33,838
Huzzah! Ha ha ha!
Oh, this is fantastic!

1032
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,646
Me and my best buddy
are lookin' for a...

1033
00:58:37,683 --> 00:58:39,207
[Clears throat]

1034
00:58:39,252 --> 00:58:41,152
[Whispering] Being quiet.

1035
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:43,485
And you have to stop
touching me.

1036
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:47,186
Touching and talking.
That's my two big no-nos.

1037
00:58:47,226 --> 00:58:49,285
OK. Now, I think
that we should--

1038
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:52,422
Say, listen, before we go out
on our big search...

1039
00:58:52,465 --> 00:58:56,959
um, would you mind if we made
a quick pit stop at my place?

1040
00:58:57,003 --> 00:58:58,971
[Chuckles] Kind of urgent.

1041
00:58:59,005 --> 00:59:02,532
JIM: BEN. I think
you just solved my problem

1042
00:59:06,646 --> 00:59:08,580
BEN:
Uh. pardon the mess. people

1043
00:59:08,614 --> 00:59:09,740
You'd think
in a hundred years...

1044
00:59:09,782 --> 00:59:11,613
l would've dusted
a little more often...

1045
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:13,983
but, you know,
when you're batchin' it...

1046
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,614
you tend to, uh, let things go.

1047
00:59:16,656 --> 00:59:18,886
Aw, isn't that sweet?

1048
00:59:18,925 --> 00:59:22,190
l find old-fashioned romance
so touching, don't you?

1049
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:24,059
How about drinks
for the happy couple?

1050
00:59:24,096 --> 00:59:26,257
Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.

1051
00:59:26,299 --> 00:59:28,199
Thank you, we don't drink...

1052
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:30,498
and, uh, we're not a couple.

1053
00:59:32,572 --> 00:59:35,040
Ahem.
Look at these markings.

1054
00:59:35,074 --> 00:59:38,407
They're identical
to the ones on the map.

1055
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:40,571
l suspect these are
the hieroglyphic remnants...

1056

of an ancient culture.

1058

stop anyone
who tries to approach. Ohh!

1059
00:59:46,886 --> 00:59:48,444
Yes, yes. Now listen to me...

1060
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:52,685

milliseconds and lie still.

Very forceful, Doctor.

1062
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,919
Go on. Say something else.

some more of your buddies!

some more of your buddies!

SILVER: Hello. up there!

1070
01:00:20,556 --> 01:00:23,923
lf it's all right
with the captain...

1071
01:00:23,959 --> 01:00:26,860
l'd like a short word with ya.

1072
01:00:26,896 --> 01:00:30,491
No tricks,
just a little palaver.

1073
01:00:30,533 --> 01:00:33,229
Come to bargain for the map,
doubtless.

1074
01:00:33,269 --> 01:00:34,395
Pestilential...

1075
01:00:34,437 --> 01:00:36,496
-Ugh!
-Captain.

1076
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:41,977
That means...that he thinks
we still have it.

1077
01:00:46,882 --> 01:00:52,821
Ah, Morphy! I wondered
where you was off to.

1078
01:00:52,855 --> 01:00:54,846
[Groaning]

1079
01:00:56,459 --> 01:00:57,687
Ooh.

1080
01:00:57,726 --> 01:01:01,025
Oh, this poor old leg's
downright snarky...

1081
01:01:01,063 --> 01:01:04,032
since that game attack
we had in the galley.

1082

[Chuckles]

1083
01:01:06,135 --> 01:01:07,727
Ahh.

1084
01:01:09,805 --> 01:01:12,740
Whatever you heard
back there...

1085
01:01:12,775 --> 01:01:15,039
at least the part
concerning you...

1086
01:01:15,077 --> 01:01:18,945
l didn't mean a word of it.

1087
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:23,111
Had that bloodthirsty lot
thought l'd gone soft...

1088
01:01:23,152 --> 01:01:25,586
they'd have gutted us both.

1089
01:01:27,723 --> 01:01:32,251
Listen to me.
lf we play our cards right...

1090
01:01:32,294 --> 01:01:37,596
we can both walk away
from this rich as kings.

1091
01:01:37,633 --> 01:01:40,067
-Yeah?
-Ha ha ha.

1092
01:01:40,102 --> 01:01:43,196
You get me that map...

1093
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:45,002
and, uh...

1094
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,534
an even portion
of the treasure is yours.

1095

[Chuckles]

1096
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:57,583
Boy.

1097
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,282
You are really something.

1098
01:02:00,322 --> 01:02:03,018
All that talk of greatness...

1099
01:02:03,058 --> 01:02:06,653
light coming off my sails...
what a joke.

1100
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:08,492
Now, just see here, Jimbo--

1101
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:09,759
l mean, at least
you taught me one thing.

1102
01:02:09,798 --> 01:02:11,163
Stick to it, right?

1103
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,168
Well, that's just
what I'm gonna do.

1104
01:02:13,202 --> 01:02:14,829
I'm gonna make sure
that you never see...

1105
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:17,498
one drabloon of my treasure!

1106
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:21,067
That treasure is owed me,
by thunder!

1107
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:25,479
Well, try to find it
without my map, by thunder!

1108
01:02:25,514 --> 01:02:30,611
Oh, you still don't know how to
pick your fights, do you, boy?

1109
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:34,089
Now, mark me.

1110
01:02:34,123 --> 01:02:37,752
Either I get that map
by dawn tomorrow...

1111
01:02:37,793 --> 01:02:41,923
or so help me,
l'll use the ship's cannons...

1112
01:02:41,964 --> 01:02:45,764
to blast ya all
to kingdom come!

1113
01:02:45,801 --> 01:02:48,827
Morph, hop to it.

1114
01:02:50,205 --> 01:02:51,672
Now!

1115
01:02:54,243 --> 01:02:56,006
Oh, blast it!

1116
01:03:07,656 --> 01:03:09,453
Gentlemen...

1117
01:03:09,491 --> 01:03:13,427
we must stay together and...

1118
01:03:13,462 --> 01:03:15,293
and...ohh.

1119
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:17,128
And what? What?!

1120
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:19,691
We must stay together
and what?!

1121
01:03:19,735 --> 01:03:25,230
Doctor,
you have wonderful eyes.

1122
01:03:25,274 --> 01:03:26,866
She's lost her mind!

1123
01:03:26,909 --> 01:03:28,137
Well, you gotta help her.

1124
01:03:28,177 --> 01:03:30,509
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer,
not a doctor.

1125
01:03:30,546 --> 01:03:32,912
l mean, I am a doctor,
but I'm not that kind of doctor.

1126
01:03:32,948 --> 01:03:34,575
l have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.

1127
01:03:34,617 --> 01:03:36,084
You can't help people
with a doctorate.

1128
01:03:36,118 --> 01:03:38,643
You just sit there,
and you're useless.

1129
01:03:38,687 --> 01:03:40,951
It's OK, Doc.

1130
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:42,719

1452
01:24:28,462 --> 01:24:31,954
lf you don't mind,
we'd just as soon avoid prison.

1453
01:24:31,999 --> 01:24:37,096
Little morphy here,
he's a free spirit.

1454
01:24:37,137 --> 01:24:40,868
Being in a cage,
it'd break his heart.

1455
01:24:40,907 --> 01:24:42,101
[Squeaks]

1456
01:24:54,254 --> 01:24:56,245
Ohh!

1457
01:24:58,492 --> 01:25:01,893
What say you ship out
with us, lad?

1458
01:25:01,928 --> 01:25:04,260
You and me,
Hawkins and Silver...

1459
01:25:04,297 --> 01:25:09,064
full of ourselves
and no ties to anyone!

1460
01:25:11,304 --> 01:25:15,638
You know,
when I got on this boat...

1461
01:25:15,676 --> 01:25:19,772
l would've taken you up
on that offer in a second...

1462
01:25:19,813 --> 01:25:24,147
but, uh,
l met this old cyborg...

1463
01:25:24,184 --> 01:25:27,642
and he taught me that
l could chart my own course.

1464
01:25:30,323 --> 01:25:31,915
That's what I'm gonna do.

1465
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:38,591
And what do you see
of that pal of yours?

1466
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:40,122
A future.

1467
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:42,761
[Chuckles] Why...

1468
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:47,831
look at ya,
glowing like a solar fire.

1469
01:25:47,874 --> 01:25:50,604
You're something special, Jim.

1470
01:25:50,644 --> 01:25:54,774
You're gonna rattle the stars,
you are.

1471
01:26:01,722 --> 01:26:03,587
[Clears throat]

1472
01:26:03,623 --> 01:26:06,524
Got a bit of grease
in this cyborg eye of mine.

1473
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,754
[Sniffles]

1474
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:11,888
[Sobbing]

1475
01:26:11,932 --> 01:26:15,732
Oh, hey, Morph.
l'll see ya around, OK?

1476
01:26:15,769 --> 01:26:16,929
See ya around.

1477
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:24,075
[Sniffs]

1478
01:26:26,413 --> 01:26:30,008
Morphy, I got a job for ya.

1479
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:35,317
l need you to keep an eye
on this here pup.

1480
01:26:37,691 --> 01:26:40,319
Will ya do me
that little favor?

1481
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,918
Aye-aye, Captain.

1482
01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:51,030
Oh, and one more thing.

1483
01:26:51,071 --> 01:26:52,470
[Chuckles]

1484
01:26:52,506 --> 01:26:54,838
This is for your dear mother...

1485
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:57,969
to rebuild that inn of hers.

1486
01:27:00,113 --> 01:27:00,180
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scalawag.

1487
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:03,308
Stay out of trouble,
ya old scalawag.

1488
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:05,910
[Laughs] Why, Jimbo, lad...

1489
01:27:05,952 --> 01:27:08,819
when have I ever done otherwise?

1490
01:27:08,855 --> 01:27:10,823
[Laughing]

1491
01:27:42,115 --> 01:27:45,107
Oh! [Giggling]

1492
01:27:50,423 --> 01:27:52,414
[Cheering]

1493
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:09,966
[Yawns]

1494
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:12,307
[All gasp]

1495
01:28:15,181 --> 01:28:17,308
[All cheer]

1496
01:28:23,156 --> 01:28:26,216
[Playing music]

1497
01:28:36,169 --> 01:28:38,160
[Crying]

1498
01:28:42,008 --> 01:28:43,498
[Laughing]

1499
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:56,411
[Song starts]

1500
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:19,502
ht's good to see the sun
and feel this place

1501
01:29:19,545 --> 01:29:23,743
This place I never thought
would feel like home

1502
01:29:23,783 --> 01:29:26,047
And I ran forever

1503
01:29:26,085 --> 01:29:28,280
Far away

1504
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:32,917
And I always thought
h'd end up here alone

1505
01:29:32,959 --> 01:29:36,690
Somehow
the world has changed

1506
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:38,856
And I've come home

1507
01:29:38,898 --> 01:29:43,130
To give you back the things
they took from you

1508
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:45,160
And I feel you now

1509
01:29:45,204 --> 01:29:47,399
I'm not alone

1510
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:53,675
h always know
where you are

1511
01:29:53,713 --> 01:29:56,113
When I see myself

1512
01:29:56,149 --> 01:30:02,645
h always know
where you are

1513
01:30:02,689 --> 01:30:07,626
Where you are

1514
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:11,721
And I found something
that was always there

1515
01:30:11,764 --> 01:30:16,360
Sometimes it's got to hut
before you feel

1516
01:30:16,402 --> 01:30:20,771
But now I'm strong.
and I won't kneel

1517
01:30:20,807 --> 01:30:24,800
Except to thank
who's watching over me

1518
01:30:24,844 --> 01:30:29,008
And somehow
h feel so strong

1519
01:30:29,048 --> 01:30:32,984
And I've begun
to be the one

1520
01:30:33,019 --> 01:30:35,249
h never thought h'd be

1521
01:30:35,288 --> 01:30:37,449
And I feel you now

1522
01:30:37,490 --> 01:30:39,924
I'm not alone

1523
01:30:39,959 --> 01:30:46,023
h always know
where you are

1524
01:30:46,065 --> 01:30:48,590
And when I see myself

1525
01:30:48,634 --> 01:30:54,971
I always know
where you are

1526
01:30:55,007 --> 01:31:00,377
Where you are

1527
01:31:00,413 --> 01:31:03,940
Now it's all so clear

1528
01:31:03,983 --> 01:31:06,281
And I believe

1529
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:10,187
That everything's been
opened up to me

1530
01:31:10,223 --> 01:31:12,282
And I feel you now

1531
01:31:12,325 --> 01:31:14,623
I'm not alone

1532
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,628
I always know

1533
01:31:16,662 --> 01:31:23,192
h always know
where you are

1534
01:31:23,236 --> 01:31:25,568
And when I see myself

1535
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:31,942
I always know
where you are

1536
01:31:31,978 --> 01:31:33,969
And when I feel the sun

1537
01:31:34,013 --> 01:31:40,543
I always know
where you are

1538
01:31:40,586 --> 01:31:43,020
And when I see myself

1539
01:31:43,055 --> 01:31:49,290
I always know
where you are

1540
01:31:49,328 --> 01:31:55,028
Where you are
