1
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,560
Bye, Carla.

2
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,960
Thomas Porter, get off of that.

3
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,160
Ah, good morning. Jason,
thank you for calling the auto club.

4
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,480
Good morning, Dr Tate.
How are you?

5
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,440
- Dr Johnson.
- Carla's ready to go.

6
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,760
She's just saying goodbye
to all her friends. Very popular girl.

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,360
Very popular. Louise?

8
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,800
Carla? Carla, your father's here.

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
Pumpkin!

10
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,800
Ohh, Carla, come on.

11
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,280
You know, we talked about this.
Now, you're ready to go home.

12
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,640
Right? You're ready to go home now.

13
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,640
She'll be fine. She'll be okay.
You're ready. You can do it.

14
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,280
<i>We're all so glad
you're comin'home, pumpkin.</i>

15
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,440
Heather flew in from New York,
and Caroline came from school.

16
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,080
And Mom...
Boy, she's just so excited.

17
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,160
She just keeps saying,
"You get my Carla back here fast. "

18
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Try these. I'm sorry the headset hurt
your ears, but they don't come in sizes.

19
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,680
- How much longer before we land?
- We're ahead of schedule.

20
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,680
We should be landing
in about 15 minutes.

21
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,080
- Thank you.
- Teeth okay?

22
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,480
Yes, they're okay.

23
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,080
<i>Honey, I'd like the girls to come with me
to the Palace of Fine Arts this weekend...</i>

24
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,600
because there's
this special exhibition...

25
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,920
Uh-uh, Carla. Oh, Carla, dear.

26
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,120
Can you please try to eat it with your
fork, and that would be very... Carla.

27
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,840
With your fork. No, no, dear.

28
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,400
I said with the fork,
not with the knife, dear.

29
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,280
All right. No, no.
No more cake. No. No.

30
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,120
- Excuse me.
- Carla?

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,320
No, no, what is the matter?
Oh, my gosh. Oh, Car...

32
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,840
- Carla, you're... Radley. Radley.
- No! No! It's my cake!

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,360
Please, come on. You're supposed
to handle... Please, Radley. Radley.

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,320
- Leave me alone!
- Carla. Carla.

35
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,680
- What the hell do they know?
- They are experts, and she has all the symptoms.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,880
- She has an I. Q bordering on 2nd grade.
- I know about...

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,760
- I know a few things about experts.
- She has... She has significant social adjustment problems.

38
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
- And now her school... - I'm sorry.
Where's my drink? - What's the matter? What?

39
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,680
Oh, your drink.
It's right there.

40
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,960
And now this school, her regular
school won't even take her back.

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,720
- What about that, Radley?
- Ah, I need another drink.

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,960
Forget the drink, Radley!

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,400
Now listen to me. We need
to talk about Carla. Do you understand?

44
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,160
- She is beautiful! - We have
got to! - Have you looked at her?

45
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,160
- She is gorgeous.
- She nearly burned the house down with the other two girls in it.

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,920
- Radley, we can't do this.
- That... That was an accident.

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,520
- You know that was an accident.
- It was not. We can't keep saying things like that.

48
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
We can't keep saying, "Carla is
a slow learner. Carla will blossom. "

49
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Because those are lies.
Now, Radley, we have to do something.

50
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,760
We have to make a decision. This is
a special school in Santa Barbara.

51
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,640
- All right, back up just... The school...
- It is for the mentally challenged.

52
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,320
- Right there. - Yes, what? - Now, they don't allow
adults and the parents to go visit them. They...

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,320
They have limited... limited visitation,
and let me tell you something, Radley.

54
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,240
- If it doesn't work out, she doesn't have to be there.
- I don't...

55
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,760
- I don't want her to be retarded.
- Of course you don't.

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,680
Of course you don't.
I understand completely.

57
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,400
We have to send her there, Radley.
We don't have a choice. All right?

58
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,640
<i>- Sign it.
- How are you two doing here? Can I get you anything?</i>

59
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,680
Can I get you anything?

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,560
Uh, no, I've got water,
and, uh... Ah.

61
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,280
We ordered
a vegetarian worm. No?

62
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,200
- I'll see if I can find one in coach.
- I would appreciate that.

63
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,560
<i>I'd like to be the first to welcome you
to San Francisco International Airport.</i>

64
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,280
<i>It's currently 54 degrees
in the Bay Area...</i>

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
<i>and a beautiful, clear day.</i>

66
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,280
<i>Thank you for choosing
to fly with us.</i>

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,880
She's here! She's home. Mrs Tate!

68
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,840
Come on.

69
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,960
All right. Okay.
Heather! Hang up!

70
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,360
She's home!

71
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,880
That call was important...

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,280
and you yelling in the background
is not exactly good for business.

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,280
- I'm sorry.
- Here we are.

74
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
the homecoming queen, Carla Tate.

75
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,280
We're all waiting for you.
Come on, honey.

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,680
Bring Tickles. Come on.

77
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,280
Oh. Ohh, hello, Carla.

78
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,080
- Welcome home. G... Hello. Hello.
- Here. I'll take this.

79
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,400
Uh, would you like
some help with that, sir?

80
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,720
- Hi, Carla! Welcome home.
- Oh, Carla, it's so good to have you home.

81
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,600
- Thanks. Say hello to Carla.
- We missed you, Carla.

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,720
- Who's that?
- Uh... Oh, well, um...

83
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,320
This is Jeff Reed.

84
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,760
And, actually, Carla, I have
kind of a surprise for you because...

85
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
we're engaged to be married.

86
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,600
Ooh, yea!

87
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,560
Well, let me take your coat,
dear. All right?

88
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,320
- No!
- Oh. You sure? You don't want...

89
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
All right, fine. Just...

90
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,680
Dr Johnson said
that it would be nice...

91
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,480
if I got everybody presents.

92
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,960
- Oh!
- And I thought so too.

93
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,200
Well, thank you, Carla.

94
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,640
- It's, uh... It's necklaces.
- Oh!

95
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,840
- And they're beautiful.
- Carla!

96
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,840
- Say cheese!
- Winnie!

97
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,080
- Welcome home! - I missed
you! - It's so good to see you!

98
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,440
Sweetheart!

99
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,000
We were thinking that maybe
we would just like to elope, you know?

100
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,440
- That's very funny, but not hysterical. All right?
- Okay!

101
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,240
We're gonna have
a big wedding ceremony at the church.

102
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,000
- And the wedding...
- I know. We're gonna have the wedding reception at the club.

103
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,040
- You remember the club, don't you, Carla dear?
- Yeah!

104
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,880
You know what. You could just put this in your
lap. That's good. That's very nice that way.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,040
You look very grown up. So I hear you
and Jeff settled on a honeymoon spot.

106
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,440
Did you two do it yet?

107
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,440
- No. Caroline.
- She's gonna spit it out. I can see it.

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,000
Sex is something that we talk
about in private, I think. Am I right?

109
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,440
No, but my teacher
at the school says...

110
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,480
that two people do it
when they're in love.

111
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,640
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm sure she meant that you
do it after, you know, you're married or something.

112
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,960
Definitely.

113
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,000
And then you don't talk about it
ever again in your whole life.

114
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,520
- Winnie.
- A special dessert for Carla.

115
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,440
- Oh, boy.
- Please.

116
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,560
- That's nice.
- So a doctorate, Jeff? That is so refreshing.

117
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
So what is your doctorate
dissertation gonna be on?

118
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
Um, multi-tiered financing
of petrol chemical surveys...

119
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,120
in an uncertain
political terrain.

120
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,400
Translation: Finding the big bucks in tiny
little countries whose names you can't pronounce.

121
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,360
Wow!

122
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,480
I mean, it's so good to hear someone's
actually using their college education.

123
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,720
Come on. You know, I'm not teaching second
grade because I happen to like children.

124
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,720
You know, I think that
they're the hope of the world.

125
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,880
Of course they're the hope of the world,
but, really, isn't it just as noble...

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,480
to be a college professor
and earn four times the money?

127
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,200
- Mother!
- You know what. Daddy, will you make a toast right now?

128
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,600
I'd gladly make a toast, yeah.
To the Tate family and its good...

129
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,280
- I want to go to school also.
- That's great.

130
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,760
Well, dear, you just completed school. And, in fact, I
think they gave you a certificate of completion, didn't they?

131
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,480
I am gonna be
a veterinarian's assistant.

132
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,760
- Wow!
- And, but to do that, I need a high school diploma.

133
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,160
I think the best thing for right now would
be just to have a nice, big, long vacation...

134
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,560
and we'll explore
your options later.

135
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,800
- Okay. To the Ta...
- I would like to explore my options now, Mother.

136
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,880
Carla, we're all just a little bit too
tired for such an important conversation.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So, Radley...

138
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,640
To the Tate family,
all of us together again.

139
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,200
Follow me. Hurry.

140
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,200
<i>- Just follow me.
- Stop it.</i>

141
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,600
<i>Stop following me.</i>

142
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,040
<i>I can't, stupid.</i>

143
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,920
- Stop it!
- I told you, I can't, stupid.

144
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,280
Stop laughing at me!

145
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,640
Oh, my goodness!
Are you all right?

146
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,320
- Carla!
- Yeah.

147
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,800
All right. Now, I want you
to close your eyes. Close your eyes.

148
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,840
Okay, Carla.
All right.

149
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,880
- No, stop, stop. Stop.
- Yeah.

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,240
You can stop. Good girl.
Open your eyes. Surprise. Do you...

151
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,560
What do you think?
You think... Do you like it?

152
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,000
- You gave my room to somebody else?
- No!

153
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,880
I redecorated it for you, dear.
I just changed it a little.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,960
- But where is my tea party table that was right here?
- Who did this?

155
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,800
Well, Carla, those are little-girl
things, and you're a young woman now.

156
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,000
Remember, downstairs you were talking
about taking on more responsibility.

157
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,840
- Well, this is...
- I want my things.

158
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,720
Carla, I really think that you should
live with these things for a while...

159
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,880
and you'll see, I'm sure that
you will grow to like them very much.

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,600
And, anyway, Dr Johnson said that, uh,
that these are your favourite colours.

161
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,280
Uh, you like red,
don't you? Where...

162
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,680
Carla, wh...
Why are your eyes closed?

163
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,120
I'm remembering my old room.

164
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,520
Ohh! Heather?

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,160
Heather!

166
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,680
Bye.

167
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
I'm really sorry we didn't
visit you more frequently...

168
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,760
but I got a job in New York,
and Caroline went to college.

169
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,960
- So...
- Yeah, but that's okay 'cause sometimes...

170
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,240
we thought that the visits
sometimes upset the parents...

171
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,440
more than it made
the kids happy.

172
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,320
Well, we're sorry, Carla.

173
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,720
But I liked all your letters
that you wrote, Heather.

174
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,680
They were better
than Caroline's...

175
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,640
'cause she mostly drew pictures.

176
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,440
- What?
- Honey, I think you just...

177
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,120
She's overwhelmed by all of this.

178
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,880
Now, why don't you just relax?
You did great, okay?

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,280
Just don't be
so hard on yourself.

180
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,280
Radley, I'm gonna
make it up to that girl.

181
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,680
I really am.

182
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,440
Winnie!

183
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,800
Your mother said
another 15 minutes.

184
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,320
Did you tell her that
I don't like tennis still?

185
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,960
She said that all
well-bred girls play tennis...

186
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,720
chess or bridge.

187
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,360
Oh.

188
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,320
Is it 15 minutes yet?

189
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,520
- We'll look at that. We'll look at that right...
- Hello, Mrs Tate.

190
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,800
- How are you? - Oh, Victoria,
you look so lovely. - Thank you.

191
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,720
I'd like you to meet my daughter.
This is Carla.

192
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,000
- Hello, Carla.
- Hello.

193
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,520
Didn't your other daughter,
Heather, get married?

194
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,840
- No, no. Actually, it's, uh, Caroline is engaged.
- Oh!

195
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,000
But anyway, I want to see
a couple of sweater sets.

196
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,240
- And, Carla, come on.
- That's a very nice shirt, Mom.

197
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,680
Very beautiful feet.
Nice toes.

198
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,920
And the sock really
accentuates your feet.

199
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,840
You know that the,
uh, the Chinese say...

200
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,080
that the toes are
the windows to the soul?

201
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,440
- They do?
- I've been to Hong Kong several times, and I've never heard that.

202
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,480
Why don't you just, uh, enlighten us
with your knowledge of shoes?

203
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,440
- Do you have this in a size eight?
- She's a little uptight, isn't she?

204
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,840
- What?
- It's tight. This shoe's a little tight.

205
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,960
It'll... Here.
How 'bout these? These red ones here.

206
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,600
- Yes, this is a fun shoe, Mom.
- I don't think so. Thank you very much.

207
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,880
What about these with the heels?
Remember the leather?

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,520
- This is hip. Hip.
- Those are not what we want. Thank you so much.

209
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,520
Mothers are always right.

210
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,880
<i>And today the dogs
are here to be seen...</i>

211
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,800
<i>in the hopes that they'll be adopted
by the nice people of Sutter Hills.</i>

212
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,680
<i>- And I'm a friend of your mother's.
- And so, thank you from me...</i>

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,680
You know that your mother was the one who
made this animal rescue shelter a possibility.

214
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,640
- No. I didn't...
- Yes, and she did a lot of other things in Sutter Hills.

215
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,640
- You're too kind.
- The youth orchestra, the theatre, the library.

216
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,920
- Wow.
- And today your mother's gonna get some recognition, which she deserves.

217
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,560
<i>My job to introduce the head
of our Sutter Hills City Council...</i>

218
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,720
<i>- Drew Edison. - Excuse
me. - Oh, sure. Of course.</i>

219
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,040
<i>Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

220
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,240
<i>There are so many people
to thank for this wonderful shelter.</i>

221
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,800
<i>- Hello, puppy. - And they
used every... - Carla, please.</i>

222
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,880
<i>- Fund-raising device known to man...
- Hello, puppy.</i>

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,880
From a, a bake sale in my mother...
Pucky Ryan's... garden.

224
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,760
Carla, please don't do that.
Please. You're disrupting.

225
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,480
<i>- ... country club.
- Woof!</i>

226
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,200
- Woof! Woof!
- Carla.

227
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,920
<i>Elizabeth. Elizabeth,
your daughter is barking.</i>

228
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,080
- Carla!
- Woof!

229
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,360
<i>- Elizabeth, now they're all barking.
- I know.</i>

230
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,480
- Carla, dear. Carla. Carla!
- Oh, I'll quiet them, Mom. They like me.

231
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,440
- Carla, Carla!
- Hello, puppies. I'll teach you how to behave, little puppies.

232
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,680
Stay! No, go, go, go.

233
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,440
- No!
- Come back in the cage. Come on.

234
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,960
Behave! Mom!

235
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,200
<i>It was so embarrassing, Radley.</i>

236
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,040
<i>I feel like... I feel like I try
all these things, and nothing works.</i>

237
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,640
<i>I've been doing my best to have fun with
her, but I don't know what fun for her is.</i>

238
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,920
<i>And she won't even tell me.</i>

239
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,840
<i>Honestly, I just want to quit.</i>

240
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,840
Mrs Tate! Mrs Tate!
Carla's run away!

241
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
<i>When the police picked her up,
she gave them another name...</i>

242
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,560
<i>and listed this as her home address,
so they threw her back here.</i>

243
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,240
- Here's the police report.
- Did she really say that I'm smothering her?

244
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,960
In so many words. Yeah.
Do you want to read the police report?

245
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,080
I just want you to know that I don't
understand any of this, not for one second.

246
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,600
I give her love, I protect her, I teach
her, and suddenly that's smothering.

247
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,880
Those are her words,
not mine, Mrs Tate.

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
Did she tell you that I took her to the
pet shelter so she could possibly get a job?

249
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,280
Yes, and we agreed it ended badly.
Could you... Could you not?

250
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,160
- That's a hand-carved Indian relic.
- I'm sorry.

251
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,120
I also enrolled her in
a calligraphy class, an origami class.

252
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,240
- And I, I even got her into that...
- She doesn't want to do those things.

253
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,480
They... They don't interest her.
They don't work for her.

254
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,760
- Maybe Carla doesn't know what works for her.
- And you do.

255
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,920
I think so. I'm her mother.

256
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,480
That's why she tried to hitchhike
over 200 miles to get back here?

257
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,200
- Would she do that again?
- I believe she will, yes.

258
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,880
If things continue at home the way
they've been going, yes, absolutely yes.

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,440
And we were lucky this time.
She came back here.

260
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,000
A lot of kids run away,
we never hear from them again.

261
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,080
This is a girl who is determined
to push the edge of the envelope.

262
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,200
And I, for one,
I like the fact that she never quits.

263
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,360
Specifically, she wants to attend
this, uh, uh, Bay Area Polytech.

264
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,880
A public vocational school?
Is that what you're talking about?

265
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,160
They do welding there.
She can't possibly keep up with that.

266
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,640
- And she's going to be humiliated by those people there.
- You don't know they're going to humiliate her.

267
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,600
- Of course they're going to humiliate her!
- Please...

268
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,360
They... They did it
when she was young. L...

269
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,240
She's got to have the opportunity
to meet challenges.

270
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,440
I mean, do you want the... do you want the
kid to remain a child the rest of her life...

271
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,320
or do you want to let her grow into an adult
and take the same risks that you and I take?

272
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,000
I want her to take risks.
It's the kind of ri... Are you a parent?

273
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,000
Uh, no, not yet, no, no,
but I have worked with children...

274
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
including yours, for ten years.

275
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,480
Y... You think she should
go to school and be on her own?

276
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,880
Independence can
give Carla something...

277
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,680
that you and I will never
be able to give her.

278
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,000
- Dignity.
- What?

279
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,320
- Dignity.
- Dignity.

280
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,800
- To the left. - Thanks a lot.
- Okay, honey, here we are now.

281
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,840
- Uh, you sure you don't want me to walk you in?
- No, Dad, I'm not... I'm fine.

282
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,200
Come on, man. You got to remember
to lock your bike up, man.

283
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,440
Your mama's gettin' tired
of buyin' you bikes.

284
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Citizenship test?

285
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,160
The courses are English,
History and Political Science.

286
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,760
Mmm. Hey, new girl.
You lookin' to score, huh?

287
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,680
Hey, send me some vibes, wolf eyes.

288
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,360
Yo, mama.
Welcome to the party.

289
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,000
Hey, don't run, baby doll.
Don't run.

290
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,360
Where are you goin'?

291
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,960
- Oh, yeah, baby. Oop! She's got the pepper spray!
- She definitely has the pepper spray!

292
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,680
- She's packing now.
- Go on through, wolf eyes.

293
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
Go on through.

294
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,240
- I have everything you need to get started, I do hope.
- Next.

295
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,280
- Hi, my name is Carla Tate.
- Nice to meet you.

296
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,160
- Uh, you're taking Computer 101.
- Yeah.

297
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,880
- That's okay, isn't it?
- The only requirement at Polytechnic is that you pay.

298
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,440
That's fine enough.
Here's your receipt. You're registered.

299
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,080
Thank you very much.

300
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,480
Next. Hello!
Let's keep the line moving, please.

301
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,600
- But he's next.
- So?

302
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,520
- He doesn't know it. Look at him.
- You're kidding me?

303
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,880
- He's asleep.
- That class is closed? It'll take an extra semester.

304
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,320
You're next in line.

305
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,320
Oh. Uh...

306
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,400
Ow! Watch what you're doing!
What is the matter with you?

307
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,040
- Uh, he's a retard.
- Oh, and that's supposed to be my problem?

308
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,840
- He nearly broke my toe.
- Hey, special boy, why don't you get back on the short bus?

309
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,120
Hey, don't talk like that.
Be nice.

310
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,440
Hi, little puppy!
Hello, puppy.

311
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,680
No, no, don't touch. He's not
for petting. He's for drug sniffing.

312
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,440
- He's on a break.
- Okay. Sorry.

313
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Well, hello, ladies.
How are you doin'?

314
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,480
Oh, Mr Taylor, hi!

315
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,400
I just have to tell you this is the best
computer class I have ever taken.

316
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,640
- Well, looks like you're doing just fine.
- And it is such thanks to you.

317
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,480
Before I came to this class, I just
didn't even know the difference...

318
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,240
between, like, a ROM
or a RAM or a bit or a byte.

319
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,800
So, um, I don't know
if you're interested or not...

320
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,720
but, um, do you give
private lessons?

321
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,080
Uh, well, no, not really.

322
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,680
- I'm gonna stay right here.
- Okay.

323
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,120
- So how 'bout you, Carla?
- What?

324
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,840
How are you doing?

325
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,480
Well, I-I know the difference
between a bit and a byte.

326
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,360
Okay. Well, you keep up the good work.

327
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,040
- Thanks.
- I'll be back if you need me.

328
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,840
- He's kind of cute, huh?
- Uh, yeah.

329
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,480
And how are you doing
over here, Mr Garbis?

330
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,840
Hi.

331
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,960
Do you give private lessons?

332
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,040
- Hi, pumpkin.
- Oh.

333
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,840
I brought some of that
nice brewed tea you like.

334
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,600
Yeah. You just put it
right by the bed, Dad.

335
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,080
I'll do that. And I'll leave you
all alone so you can do your homework.

336
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,560
- Okay?
- Okay.

337
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,080
- Okay.
- Good night.

338
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,480
Good night, pumpkin.

339
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,320
Come on, Danny. Here we go.
Hold on one second. Let me put it down.

340
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,480
- You're really strong, Rachel.
- Yeah, Danny, thanks.

341
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,840
Watch it.

342
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,600
L- I'll see you later, Rachel!

343
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,280
- Hi!
- Hi.

344
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,680
Hi. My name's Daniel McMahon.

345
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,600
I know. I asked someone
what your name was.

346
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,000
My name is Carla Tate.

347
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,360
Hello, Carla Tate.

348
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,280
Thank you for helping me the other day
with re... with registration.

349
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,240
It was really confusing.

350
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,640
Yeah, I know.

351
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,280
You're welcome. Okay, bye.

352
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,440
Yeah, thank...

353
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,640
Where are you going
right now, Carla Tate?

354
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,160
I have to go phone my father
to come pick me up...

355
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,600
because I got out
of school early today.

356
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,000
- Well, okay.
- Do you... You wanna... You wanna get a soda and something to eat first?

357
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,080
L... 'Cause I know
the greatest place, and I can drive.

358
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,920
Well!

359
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,080
Is this a date?

360
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,960
No, it's just getting sodas
and something to eat.

361
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,280
Good. 'Cause I don't
want to date yet.

362
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,680
Look at the buses.
Watch 'em.

363
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,440
Why? What are they gonna do?

364
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,800
They pull in, and then
they pull out, and they turn...

365
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,600
and they back up.

366
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,560
I went... I went to a regular school.

367
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,040
I went for
a long, long, long time. Hi!

368
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,680
L- I finally quit
when I grew a moustache...

369
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,560
'cause I looked older
than the teachers.

370
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,960
Stop it. I don't like
when people laugh at me.

371
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,040
No, I wasn't laughing at you.
I was just making a joke.

372
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,480
- Oh.
- T-This is the Falcon Bar.

373
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,320
And this is where
all the bus people come.

374
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,640
- "Free tids and bits"?
- You can eat till you burst.

375
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,880
Sometimes I-I mess up
on my allowance...

376
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,600
and then... and then
I- I just come here.

377
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,480
Um, a-a-and I can eat all I want.

378
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,720
You see that girl over there?

379
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,440
Don't ever play pool with her
'cause she'll beat you.

380
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,840
They call her the Black Widow.

381
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,880
She has really long hair.

382
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,640
L- I-I like short hair.

383
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,160
It's easy. You just... You just
get on, and you give them a ticket.

384
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,480
But what if you take
the wrong bus?

385
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,760
Uh, th-the driver
just throws you off.

386
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,480
See, okay, I been on...
I been on most of these buses...

387
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,120
and I been... I been thrown
off most of them too.

388
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,680
You must like taking
bus rides, Daniel.

389
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,360
Uh, no. Well, no,
'cause I... 'cause I...

390
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,760
I- I gotta take
the buses to see, uh...

391
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,760
to see marching bands
at the college football games.

392
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,640
Th... um, this one takes me
to UCLA, Stanford...

393
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,040
and th-this one takes you...

394
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,200
- Hi, Francis.
- Danny.

395
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,440
This one takes me
to Western Pacific State.

396
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,720
Well, you must really like
marching bands then.

397
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,040
Yeah. Yeah,
I love marching bands.

398

working with one.

400
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,040
'cause this is where I usually sit
when I'm waiting for buses.

401
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,680
Okay.

402
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,840
And I-I usually sit there,
but it's usually empty.

403
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,880
If it... If it was empty,
I could... I could sit next to you.

throw marshmallows onto the field...

to get them into the tubas.

it's fun and stuff.

Oh, I'm just writing things down

I'm gonna have a job, too...

440
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,240
But could I have a pet too?

441
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,760
Oh, definitely. Definitely.

442
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,720
I have to call my father now.

443
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,080
I don't have to call my father.

444
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,080
They put gum in my hat again.

445
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,560
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

446
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,600
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

447
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,120
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Carla
- So high...</i>

448
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,440
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

449
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,800
<i>- Oh, that was so good. - And
many more - I have to make a wish.</i>

450
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,200
Yes, all right. All right.
Make a...

451
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,080
- Happy 22nd, Carla.
- Yeah!

452
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Thank you for coming back
for my birthday.

453
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,240
Are you kidding?
We wouldn't miss this for the world.

454
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,640
Yeah, Winnie tells me that, uh, Carla
bought groceries for the family this week...

455
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,560
and she did some of the cooking too,
right, Winnie?

456
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,320
And she helped me do all my laundry
that I brought from school.

457
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,080
- Yeah. And I recycled all the garbage, Mother.
- I know.

458
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,040
Well, I mean, someday you'll be able to take
care of this house without me. That's for sure.

459
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,840
Not this house.

460
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
Maybe one day I'll be able
to take care of my own apartment...

461
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,240
like some of the kids at school do.

462
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,680
- Oh, Carla, you don't know what you're saying.
- Yes, I do.

463
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,960
No, we can't discuss this right now,
all right? Open these presents.

464
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,440
- Here. There.
- But...

465
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,240
Thank you, Radley.
Here you go, dear. There.

466
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,120
- "Carla. " It's from...
- Excuse me now.

467
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,880
- I have to go feed my fish.
- Oh.

468
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,600
- Mother, why did you do that?
- Aw, Mom. - What did I do?

469
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,320
I mean, maybe she's ready
for her own apartment.

470
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,640
You know, a lot
of the new books out right now...

471
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,320
you know, they... they advocate
disabled people living on their own.

472
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,280
- What are we movin' the presents for? - Why
don't we just take a vote? - Yeah, voting's nice.

473
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,680
- Oh, a family meeting.
- Yes! A family meeting.

474
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,480
We haven't had a family meeting in ages.
I would love to try it.

475
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,400
I think we should just forget this,
because I just want to say something.

476
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,880
This is not a political referendum.
This is a child's life.

477
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,480
And this is my child's life.
Carla's not ready for an apartment.

478
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,760
And really, she may never
be ready for an apartment. My God!

479
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,080
What if there were a fire?
What if there was a burglar?

480
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,040
- Well, that can happen to anyone, honey.
- "What if?" - No, but not with Carla.

481
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,760
She can't handle the unexpected,
Radley. You know that.

482
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,680
Mother, I think that she has tried very
hard to show that she's a responsible person.

483
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,200
- Heather!
- She's capable.

484
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,840
You don't live here any more,
so you don't vote!

485
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,840
Mom, why don't you think
of it this way, as a...

486
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,400
Oh, look, Caroline, you and Jeffrey can raise your children
any way you want to raise them, but this is my child!

487
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,080
- All right. All right. Ease up.
- You know something? I don't know what you're trying to do.

488
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,800
I don't know what you're trying to prove
by refuting every single thing I say.

489
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,120
- I'm not refuting everything you say!
- I didn't want to put her in that place!

490
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,840
But I had to.
I had no other choice.

491
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,080
She needed professional help.

492
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,440
Now it is Carla's turn,
and I am going to protect her!

493
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,120
And nobody's going to tell me
how to do it, not even you, Radley. No!

494
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,960
Girls, inside, please.

495
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,360
- I guess we'll be forever 10 and 12.
- Marcia and Jan.

496
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,160
- Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?
- Elizabeth, shut the hell up.

497
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,840
- It means a lot to me...
- Do not...

498
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,320
Do not speak to me that way
in front of the children.

499
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,040
And we are both responsible
for putting Carla in that place.

500
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,880
You went along with it
because you were too drunk to face it.

501
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,640
I made that decision by myself!

502
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,080
I wasn't drinking when I picked her up,
and I haven't had a drink...

503
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,240
since that family meeting
8 years, 4 months and 11 days ago!

504
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,520
That is not the...
That is not the same...

505
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,320
It is the same family. Damn it!
Our family, Elizabeth!

506
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,760
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

507
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,080
Dinner will be served soon.

508
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,480
I'll skip dinner.

509
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,200
- Permission to come aboard?
- Permission granted.

510
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,600
I don't know what's the matter with me.
I just... I...

511
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,720
Anyway, I never meant to insinuate
anything against you.

512
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,280
Maybe we should just trust Carla.

513
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,040
But it's not just trusting Carla.
I really don't think so.

514
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,480
I think it's everybody.
It's everything out there. It's the...

515
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,280
Well, she can live near us.
That way we can keep an eye on her.

516
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,400
She just got back.
Does she have to leave so soon?

517
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,840
Not like you planned, huh?

518
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,120
No. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

519
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,840
Is anybody coming to dinner, or
are we voting on what's being served?

520
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,840
What?

521
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,080
What is...

522
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,520
- Well...
- Hot roll or baguette?

523
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,520
I think I will have a hot roll...
Oh, come on, please.

524
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,320
This is just absurd.

525
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,440
This is not a casual decision,
and Carla is not like other girls.

526
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,200
But I don't want to be the one who
always says no to her. I really don't.

527
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,960
So I'm gonna try and
see it your way. I'm gonna try and see...

528
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,240
- Oh!
- I am so happy, Mama!

529
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,440
- This is so great!
- Carla? This is...

530
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,640
- You could come and help me pick an apartment out...
- Not quite so hard to Mom. Okay.

531
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,280
- And everything.
- All right, maybe we will. Maybe I could do that.

532
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,560
I could call up Gibson Realty. We could
have them, you know, get a couple of videos.

533
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,160
- Dear, that is my... Oh, dear.
- Mom, this is the best...

534
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,080
- birthday present I've ever had.
- Please don't do that.

535
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,800
I'm thrilled. Is everybody happy?

536
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,040
Bye!

537
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,600
- Bye, Daniel! Bye!
- Bye!

538
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,280
- Bye, Daniel!
- Bye!

539
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Bye, Carla!

540
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:21,840
Bye. L-I'll see you tomorrow.
Goodbye.

541
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,880
So who's the fella?
Is he kind of a sweetheart?

542
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,880
No, that's my friend Daniel.

543
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,600
Um, but I like
to call him Danny.

544
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,280
Danny. Well, Danny's kind of cute.

545
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,800
Stop teasing, Dad!

546
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,240
Carla, this way. Uh, your father
mentioned that you met a young man.

547
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,200
Yeah, that's Daniel.

548
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,680
But I told Dad that he was just
a "friend" friend, not a boyfriend.

549
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,760
Darling, don't sit there!
It's just wet.

550
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,560
No, it isn't, Mom. It's dry.

551
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,080
It's dry, Mom.

552
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,280
Well, Carla, you're going
to be getting this apartment...

553
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,600
and I'm sure you're gonna want
to have visitors come over...

554
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,880
and I'm sure that some
of these visitors are going to be...

555
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,680
well, they're going
to be young men.

556
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,480
Mom, is this a sex talk?

557
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,280
No.

558
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,440
Well, yes. Is that okay?

559
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,280
- Okay.
- All right. Okay.

560
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,600
Well, then I know that
recently you mentioned, um...

561
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,880
doing it...

562
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,240
and I just wanted to know
if you really know what that means.

563
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,080
Yeah, that's what
Thomas Porter calls it.

564
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,000
And Mrs Matthews, the health teacher
and the cafeteria monitor...

565
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,400
she called it coitus.

566
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,360
- And she also told us about penis...
- Okay, we've got it.

567
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,400
- And vulva.
- Shh. Carla. Just a little less loud, okay?

568
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,280
- And then she was telling us all about semen...
- Carla, honey.

569
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,160
And how there's 50 billion sperms
in one shot, and that...

570
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,280
No, no, no.
We do have the... We have the...

571
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,760
- Yeah, yeah. All right. That's very good. No, no.
- I know all about it.

572
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,600
You know all about it. I understand that. You know
all about reproduction. That's excellent. Good.

573
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,160
Yeah, and she also told me...

574
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,280
that people like us...

575
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,480
they... boys can try
to take advantage...

576
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,560
and that they'll try to coitus us.

577
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,120
So if that should
ever happen, to say, "No!

578
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,080
- Oh. Okay.
- Stop right there!"

579
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,280
Good. And that's excellent advice.
What else did she say to you?

580
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,760
"Don't put gum under
the cafeteria table!

581
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,160
How many times
do I have to tell you?"

582
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,240
She's teaching you
a lot of variety there.

583
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:48,560
Anyway, dear, with this apartment, I just
don't think that you should have, um...

584
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,120
any boyfriends over
for a while, all right?

585
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,480
- Is that okay with you?
- But, Mom...

586
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,320
what if I want to go visit...

587
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,600
at someone else's apartment?

588
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,400
Well, in that case,
you remember "No, stop. "

589
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,040
And you don't forget
your pepper spray.

590
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,000
- Whose apartment might you be visiting, Carla?
- Nobody's.

591
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,280
I was just saying what if.
I'm gonna go feed the birds.

592
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,000
Okay. Oh, geez.

593
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,040
No, Carla, wait!
Get away from the water.

594
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,040
Hello, duckies.

595
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,800
- Come here, duckies.
- Carla!

596
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,680
<i>- I want to live
- Like animals</i>

597
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,680
<i>- Careless and free
- Like animals</i>

598
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,520
<i>- I want to live
- Uh, excuse me, sir.</i>

599
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,480
Does this bus go
to La Pine Street?

600
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Nah, this is the eastbound.
You want the westbound over there.

601
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,880
But I took four buses already.

602
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,360
- I don't know what to tell you, but that bus will take you there.
- Okay.

603
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,360
Thank you very much.

604
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,880
<i>It's so confusing
There's so many rules to follow</i>

605
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,240
<i>But I don't feel it</i>

606
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:12,840
<i>'Cause I just run away in my mind</i>

607
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,200
<i>Ohh-ohh</i>

608
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,600
<i>- I want to live

609

610
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
<i>I want to live</i>

611
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,080
<i>I want to run through thejungle
The wind in my hair</i>

612
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,600
<i>And the sand at my feet</i>

613
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,920
Daniel!

614
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,480
- Hey!
- Hi.

615
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,320
You found it!

616
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,440
And... And these are my CDs.

617
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,240
Would you have any blues? My friend
and I at my school, we love the blues.

618
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,880
I like, like Muddy Waters
and Billie Holiday.

619
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,440
- She's dead, you know.
- Yeah.

620
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,040
Yeah. I like that one song
where she sings...

621
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,000
<i>I'm gonna love you</i>

622
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,080
<i>Like nobody's loved you</i>

623
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,080
<i>Come rain or come shine</i>

624
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,920
No, but I-I have marching bands.

625
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,560
L- I-I have marching bands
from all over the world.

626
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,440
From Scotland and from Russia.

627
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,800
But do you have
the one song that goes...

628
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,600
<i>- I'm gonna love you
- No blues!</i>

629
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,760
<i>- I'll... Okay, I'll... I'll play you my favourite one now, okay?
- Like nobody's</i>

630
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,800
<i>Loved you</i>

631
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,680
<i>Come...</i>

632
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,840
W- Watch. Watch this.
Watch this.

633
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,520
You're gonna wake...
You're gonna wake Mrs Waters' baby.

634
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,720
I've told you time and time again,
don't play the music so loud.

635
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,880
- Okay, okay. S- Sometimes
I forget, Ernie. - Yeah.

636
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,880
- Who are you?
- This is... This is Ernie. He's a painter.

637
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,120
- And he... he's a, a musician.
- Well...

638
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,920
I'm an art, painting, music
and volume control manager.

639
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,160
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know you were entertaining a lady.

640
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,160
No, Ernie, this is... this is
Carla. She's... She's my friend.

641
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,080
My name is Carla Tate.

642
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,280
Thanks for calling me a lady.

643
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,320
<i>Mrs Tate, I want you to bear in mind that all the
apartments that I'm gonna be showing you in the video are...</i>

644
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,840
Winnie, where's Carla?
She should be here. She should see this.

645
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,760
Oh, she phoned to say she's
going to be a little late.

646
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,240
- She's studying with friends.
- Really?

647
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,560
Now, remember,
this is tape number two.

648
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,400
<i>- Now, Mrs Tate, it's a little small. Kitchen.
- No, this is out of the question.</i>

649
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,640
No, I don't like it.

650
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,840
- I agree.
- No, next, okay?

651
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,600
- Oh, Ernie...
- Yeah?

652
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,200
- Uh, did my dad send a cheque... -
Oh, yeah, yeah. - For, for my allowance?

653
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,960
- Hold on. Here. That's right. I forgot.
- Okay.

654
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,640
- I got two leaky sinks here. Here.
- Okay.

655
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,360
Paid your bills.
Here's your allowance.

656
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Don't spend it all
on the first date, all right?

657
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,640
- Yeah, my... my dad sells Mercedes. Yeah.
- Right. Okay.

658
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,680
- All right? All right.
- Okay. Bye!

659
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,360
- Bye. - Okay!
- Bye now!

660
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,360
Ernie has killed people.

661
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,880
What?

662
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,560
He was in Vietnam.

663
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,360
He doesn't like to talk about it,
but he talks to me about it.

664
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,480
And he lives down
in the basement all alone.

665
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,680
- What I really like is the kitchen.
- Yeah, isn't that beautiful?

666
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,360
- It's sweet.
- You know, and a lot of the owners don't like to rent to people like Carla.

667
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,280
- And knowing that...
- I'm sorry. Would you wait one second?

668
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,960
- Well, I mean, not don't like to...
- I'm sorry, but there are no people like Carla, okay?

669
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,880
- She happens to be a very unique young woman.
- Okay.

670
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,360
Okay. Of course she is,
but they just wanna know...

671
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,200
if the unique young woman
is gonna leave the gas on...

672
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,600
or if she's gonna leave
the door unlocked.

673
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,440
This is them asking, not me.
Is she reliable?

674
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,680
Well, of course she's reliable. I mean,
this is her first apartment, though.

675
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,080
I mean, I can't vouch for the fact that the
window might not be left open during a rainstorm...

676
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,280
but what mother
can vouch for that?

677
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,080
Look, I understand what their concerns are,
but let me tell you something right now, okay?

678
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,040
My daughter happens to be
a very amazing person.

679
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,320
She's tough,
and she is adamant to be on her own.

680
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,280
She's gonna be just fine.

681
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,960
Now, if there's any sort of a problem,
I am only 15 minutes away.

682
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,560
- You think that's gonna be enough for them?
- It's enough for me.

683
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,760
All right. Thank you.
Let's watch it.

684
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,280
No! She can't marry
that guy, Daniel.

685
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,040
I want her to marry
Dustin Hoffman.

686
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,960
Yeah. Okay. Okay,
wait just a second.

687
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,080
<i>Elaine!</i>

688
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,880
<i>- Elaine!
- Whoa-oh!</i>

689
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,280
Yeah!

690
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,000
- Yeah.
- Do they live happily ever after, Daniel?

691
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,680
<i>Well, I don't know. I don't know.
They didn't make a Graduate 2.</i>

692
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,960
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

693
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,080
That was a great movie, Daniel.
I'm so happy you let me watch it.

694
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,080
I would have never seen it
had you not asked me to see it.

695
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,280
Carla, do you...
do you wanna be my friend?

696
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,880
- I am your friend.
- No, no, no. L-I... No, I don't...

697
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,880
I like that one part where he's trying
to get away from his parents.

698
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,880
I don't mean "friend" friend.
I mean boy-girlfriend.

699
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,760
Are you getting
the pepper spray?

700
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,280
No. I'm thinking.

701
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,160
Okay.

702
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,560
Okay.

703
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,680
Okay.

704
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,440
<i>One bedroom, one bathroom,
hardwood floors...</i>

705
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,840
<i>- eat-in kitchen, working fireplace.
- That is good.</i>

706
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,760
- I knew it. I knew it.
- This... I love those Georg...

707
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,960
<i>That's a Georgian window, Mrs Tate. That's
a classic. That's a San Francisco classic.</i>

708
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Hi, Daniel.

709
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,040
Hi!

710
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,680
Mr Vitello, s-she's my friend.
She's my friend.

711
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,640
- Wh-What are you doing here?
- I came to tell you the best news.

712
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,560
Wh-Wh... What's that?
What's that?

713
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,200
I got my own apartment,
my very own apartment.

714
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,880
Nobody lives there but me,
and I move there in two weeks!

715
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,880
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

716
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,120
Sorry, Mr Vitello. Sorry.

717
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,080
See, not a marshmallow in the bunch.

718
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,840
Okay, okay, okay,
see that guy right there?

719
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,560
That's my friend,
and he's... he's a bandmaster.

720
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,320
And see that guy right there
with the big baton?

721
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,840
That guy's name
is Wally Williams...

722
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,480
and, and, and he's a drum major, and
they, they, they call him Walkin' Wally.

723
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,680
- Why?
- I don't know.

724
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,480
All right, perfect.
Once again from the top.

725
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,280
- Hi, everybody!
- Hey, Danny.

726
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,840
- Hi.
- Hey, Danny. Uh, how's it goin'?

727
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:20,520
- Good.
- I wasn't expecting to see you till Monday.

728
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,680
Uh... Yeah, just 'cause... just 'cause
I wanted... I wanted to bring Carla in...

729
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,320
so that she could see
where I work.

730
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,360
- Hi, Carla. - Hey, Carla.
- She... She's my girlfriend.

731
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,160
Ohh!

732
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,040
No, I... They're
not laughing at you.

733
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,520
You just missed marching band rehearsal, and
right now we're working with the Dixieland band.

734
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,640
Ohh.

735
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,240
But you know what?
I was just talking to Wally.

736
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,800
And we decided it would be great
to hear the band from the audience.

737
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,240
<i>Wow, Carla. A new boyfriend.</i>

738
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,760
<i>- And now a dance?
- Yeah. The dance is this Friday.</i>

739
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,440
<i>- Mm, that's exciting.
- Well, I was just calling, Heather...</i>

740
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,160
<i>because I wanted to tell you
the good news...</i>

741
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,640
and I want to look special,
with nice make-up on...

742
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,480
and I don't think
I could do it myself.

743
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,960
<i>Just go to the mall. They have
lots of make-over places there.</i>

744
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,280
<i>- You know, they'll just do it for you or show you how.
- Really?</i>

745
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,560
- Free make-over demonstration over here.
- Really?

746
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,400
- We can do wonders for you, I promise.
- Good. Thanks.

747
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,720
- Hi, miss. We're having a free
make-over demonstration. - No, thank you.

748
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,280
- Free make-overs.
- Oh, it's free?

749
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,480
Wow. But over there, it's 35.

750
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,320
- But it's free over there.
- Thank you.

751
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,360
And smile. Perfect! Beautiful.

752
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,560
Now, this is the new you.

753
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,080
The old you.

754
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,280
Good.

755
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,680
Not so good.

756
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,680
Okay. Anyone else
for a free make-over demonstration?

757
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,160
But when are you gonna do
the rest of my face?

758
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,680
This is a demonstration, and
this demonstration was absolutely free.

759
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,480
Oh, but how much is it
to buy the other half of my face?

760
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,520
About $50.

761
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,320
- But I don't have $50.
- Oh.

762
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,080
Well, then I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take the
next customer then, so if you could just move aside.

763
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,200
But you didn't say anything
about $50 before.

764
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,920
Come on. Everybody knows
the whole thing isn't free.

765
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,840
- But that's not fair.
- Life isn't fair.

766
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,040
Okay, if you'll just step aside.
Thank you so much for coming in.

767
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,760
- That's not fair.
- Bye-bye now.

768
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,240
Next.

769
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,720
<i>Well, you walk right in</i>

770
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,040
<i>And you walk right out, hmm</i>

771
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,200
<i>You walk right in there</i>

772
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,440
<i>Walk right out</i>

773
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,480
<i>Well, my baby keeps on walkin'</i>

774
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,080
<i>All she want to do
is walk right in, yeah</i>

775
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,240
<i>She walk right out</i>

776
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,760
<i>She walks right in there</i>

777
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,320
<i>She walks right out</i>

778
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,480
- Happy Halloween.
- Hi.

779
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,560
There's just too many people out there
who'll take advantage of you.

780
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,360
I don't think
you should go to the dance.

781
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,760
- Mother!
- What?

782
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,800
- I have to go to the dance.
- Well...

783
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,640
- You said I could.
- I know, I know. Okay, okay.

784
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,640
Can you do a whole new make-up?

785
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,600
No, I won't do that, Carla.
Now, you have such a lovely face.

786
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,760
You don't need
all that make-up. No.

787
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,520
- Well...
- What?

788
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,720
How about if you taught me
how to dance?

789
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,120
Wow, Mom!

790
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,200
<i>I feel the earth move
under my feet</i>

791
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,400
- But I can't do that with my arms.
- Yes, you can.

792
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,960
Look at me.
It's very simple.

793
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,120
<i>I feel my heart
start to tremblin'</i>

794
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,680
<i>- Whenever you're around
- I feel the earth</i>

795
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,240
Thomas Porter, at my school,
he used to go like this.

796
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,480
- Oh, no, no, Carla. Stop. No, no, don't. No, Carla.
- And then the teacher would come and...

797
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,560
- All right.
- Darling, just don't move your hips like that.

798
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,920
Don't do this. Don't do that. Just
keep it calm down there. That's right.

799
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,480
Give me your hand.

800
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,280
- Okay. -
Whoo! - Wow!

801
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,320
And then the dip thing!

802
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,520
Oh, dear! I'm terrible!

803
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,720
You're funny, Mom!

804
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,920
Oh, my baby. I love you.

805
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,640
- I love you.
- You're silly.

806
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,160
You're silly. Oh, dear.
Oh, dear, what's the matter with me?

807
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,800
- Wow.
- What's the matter with... I might be having a breakdown.

808
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,280
- But, Mom...
- Oh, dear.

809
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,080
I have to learn my slow dances too.

810
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,760
No, but slow dances, dear, they're...

811
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,680
they're a bit of a problem because you don't
want to get too close, you really don't.

812
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,880
You want to keep time to the music.

813
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,480
<i>Want to do it</i>

814
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,560
- Stand up and I'll show you how you do it. You just sort of...
- Yeah.

815
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,760
<i>You made me want you</i>

816
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,480
<i>- And all the time you knew it
- All the time you knew it</i>

817
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:29,160
<i>- Yeah. Well, all the movies I've s-seen,
Mom, they all... - I guess you always knew it</i>

818
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,640
- It's slow, like this.
- No, no. I don't think so, Carla.

819
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,400
When they start to play a slow song,
I think what might be best is...

820
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,280
you and your partner should immediately
go and get yourselves a soda.

821
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,320
<i>- That might be nice.
- But there were times</i>

822
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,320
<i>Dear</i>

823
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,960
Happy Halloween, Dad!

824
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,880
Look what Winnie made me.

825
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,840
My pumpkin's a duck.

826
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,680
- No, I'm a swan.
- Oh, yeah, a swan. Of course. You...

827
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,120
I feel so delicate.

828
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,240
Oh, honey, well, you have
always been delicate to me...

829
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,480
and you were always beautiful.

830
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,480
What is it? What... Ohh!

831
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,880
- Oh, look at you!
- Careful.

832
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,920
<i>- It's Swan Lake.
- Yeah.</i>

833
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,480
Oh, you're beautiful.
Now, Carla, let me just take that off.

834
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,720
'Cause I don't think that's gonna fit
in the back seat of the car.

835
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,880
And, Radley, you'd better get going,
otherwise you're gonna be late.

836
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,400
Oh, wait!
Oh, wait just one minute.

837
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,800
- My, uh, boyfriend is coming...
- Here...

838
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,160
- and he's gonna go with us.
- Boyfriend?

839
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,640
Don't make that face, Mom.
He's very nice.

840
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,840
- He has two jobs, Mom.
- What kind of jobs does he have, Carla?

841
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,720
- Well, he wor... One w... He works at the bakery.
- The bakery.

842
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,600
And then the other one is, he's a music...
works in the music department at the university.

843
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,160
- I don't know...
- That's nice.

844
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,160
- Oh! That's him! - L... I... -
Radley, come here just one moment.

845
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,440
- Do you believe this?
- What?

846
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,440
This guy has the nerve
to come to our very own home.

847
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,680
- I mean, what does he want with her anyway?
- Honey, she's a very attractive girl.

848
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,720
- She's very pretty anyway, and he just...
- I'll tell you what he wants. He wants to have his way with her. That's what he wants.

849
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,880
Hi, Daniel.

850
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,440
- Hi. You look really pretty.
- Thank you.

851
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,360
This is my idea of a nightmare.

852
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,960
Mom!

853
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,000
- I want you to meet Daniel.
- Oh.

854
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,040
And Daniel, this is my mother
and my father.

855
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,960
Hello... Ohh!

856
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,680
What is... What?

857
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,720
- Give me your paw, Daniel.
- Hello.

858
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,760
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Look, do, uh...

859
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,360
- Do you have a head? You know, a head.
- Sorry.

860
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,840
I did... I didn't...

861
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,920
Oh, he's the boy at school.
Yes, well, I'm gonna find my car keys.

862
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,240
Don't worry,
'cause I've been house-trained.

863
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,160
- That's a joke, Mom.
- You're gonna have a wonderful time tonight.

864
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,600
- Okay! - Yeah. -
Sure. - Sure, dear.

865
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,840
- So, that's an excellent costume you picked out there.
- Goodbye.

866
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,000
- You don't wanna miss that party.
- What's that right there? - Oh.

867
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,720
- Trick or treat!
- My dad gives these instead of candy.

868
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,560
Oh! Up and down, and not across.

869
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,640
- Thank you! Okay.
- Bye, Carla.

870
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,920
- Bye, Mom. - Bye.
- Bye. - Be good.

871
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,840
- Oh, dear.
- Well...

872
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,120
<i>I am not the person
who is singing</i>

873
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,760
<i>I am the silent one inside</i>

874
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,600
<i>I am not the one
who laughs at people's jokes</i>

875
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,840
We're not responsible for lost items...

876
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,040
so please make sure you pick up
your wings and your antlers.

877
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,960
Also, for those interested...

878
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,080
the first-quarter grades are posted
downstairs on the bulletin board.

879
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,520
Who's next?

880
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,000
I want to see if I passed.

881
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,400
- Come on, Daniel.
- Um, well, o-okay.

882
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,920
She said it was downstairs.

883
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,600
<i>He who makes the monsters</i>

884
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,240
<i>He who strips my confidence</i>

885
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,640
I passed it.

886
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,440
I passed it, Daniel!

887
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,440
I passed my subject
in a regular school...

888
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,160
with real tests
and regular teachers.

889
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,480
I did it, Daniel!

890
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,480
I love Polytechnic School!

891
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,320
I love my teachers!
I love everybody, Daniel!

892
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,440
But... But, Daniel...

893
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,560
you didn't fail by much,
just a smidge.

894
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,680
My... Ohh.

895
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,400
I didn't... I didn't want to
fail by a smidge. I wanted...

896
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,920
I- I-I wanted to...
I wanted to get out of one class...

897
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,440
just 'cause I passed, not 'cause I was...
n- not 'cause I was too old.

898
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,400
It's o... It's o... It's okay, Daniel.
Don't... Don't be upset.

899
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,520
No! No, it isn't okay!
It isn't...

900
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,320
Everybody... Everybody's right!
Everybody's right, Carla!

901
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,600
Every... I am... I'm dumb!

902
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,440
Everybody's right, Carla!
Everybody...

903
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:26,160
Carla... C-Carla, can you... C-Could
you go away for a second? Please?

904
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,160
Okay. Okay.

905
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,680
At my special school
they taught us...

906
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,480
that first you learn
the easy courses.

907
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,080
Then after you learn those,
you try the harder courses.

908
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,200
Only they're not so hard any more...

909
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,880
because you learned
the easy stuff first.

910
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,800
See?

911
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,920
An-Another reason I got mad is 'cause
I- I didn't want you to think I was dumb.

912
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,680
I could never think that.

913
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,480
<i>It's amazing how you</i>

914
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,840
<i>Can speak right to my heart</i>

915
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,840
<i>Without sayin'a word</i>

916
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,840
<i>You can light up the dark</i>

917
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,680
<i>Try as I may</i>

918
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,560
<i>I could never explain</i>

919
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:01,560
<i>What I hear
when you don't say a thing</i>

920
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,560
<i>The smile on your face</i>

921
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,920
<i>Lets me know that you need me</i>

922
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,000
<i>There's a truth in your eyes</i>

923
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,400
<i>Sayin'you'll never leave me</i>

924
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,440
<i>The touch of your hand</i>

925
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,360
<i>Says you'll catch me</i>

926
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,760
<i>If ever I fall</i>

927
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,640
<i>You say it best</i>

928
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,520
<i>When you say nothin'at all</i>

929
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,880
Okay, you're disappointed.
Disappointed in what?

930
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,880
- Uh, me? You? Us? What?
- Well, no, dear, not us.

931
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,480
But, I mean, of course
it has been bumpy at times.

932
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,600
But... But I always thought
we'd end up like this, you know.

933
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,120
- Somehow sailing along together.
- Oh, well, good, good. You're not disappointed in us.

934
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,640
'Cause I love sailing with you. The girls,
they never really liked sailing much.

935
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,120
- Yeah.
- You disappointed with the girls?

936
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,800
Well, I feel like I'm the mother of a
dedicated underachiever, a gay workaholic...

937
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,240
and Carla, who thinks she can conquer this
whole terrifying world that we live in.

938
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,880
Honey, they're doing fine.

939
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,240
They're not drug addicts; they're not
axe murderers; they're not Democrats.

940
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,960
I don't know. Tell me... I don't know
why I am talking like this anyway...

941
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:21,320
but honestly, Radley, sometimes I think that there
must be some mothers out there in the world...

942
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,680
who are better equipped
to handle Carla.

943
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,840
Elizabeth, stop it, will ya.

944
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,760
I mean, I know that I fail
in some horrible way. Do you know...

945
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,080
Oh, I'll shut up. I promise.
Radley, I'm gonna shut my mouth.

946
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,880
Honey, you're just trying
to be honest with yourself.

947
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,560
- It's okay.
- It's not fair, Radley. It's not fair.

948
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,120
First you're judged as a person,
and then you become a parent...

949
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:49,640
and not only are you judged as a person, but you're
also judged by how well your children are doing.

950
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,280
I mean, not who they are, not what they
think, but just how well they're doing.

951
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,880
- Elizabeth.
- What?

952
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,640
They're doing just fine.
We are doing just fine.

953
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,080
- What is this?
- Fire.

954
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,200
- And what is the blue?
- That's the police.

955
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,520
- And finally, the green.
- The hospital.

956
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,200
- That is excellent. - Uh,
Elizabeth, how many... - Oh! Thanks.

957
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,640
- Now what... Oh, just...
- how many of these extinguishers did you buy?

958
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,760
Not enough, obviously.
Hold on just a second.

959
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,720
- L... I know what I'm gonna do. - What are you
doing now? - I'm gonna put it in the kitchen.

960
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,800
This is... All right.

961
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,600
Dad, she put one in my bathroom.

962
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,560
Well... Good luck,
person in her first apartment.

963
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,240
- Oh, pumpkin.
- My first apartment.

964
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,760
Yes.

965
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,760
Now, if you feel lonely or if you need
anything, call dear old dad, okay?

966
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,000
- I will.
- All right.

967
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,000
- All right... -
Well... - say goodbye.

968
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,920
Thank you, Mom.

969
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,960
- Elizabeth.
- Don't worry.

970
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,880
- Oh, dear. I got a little bit of lipstick on you.
- I'll be okay.

971
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,720
- All right, of course we have to go. Good. Let's go, then.
- All right.

972
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,800
Oh, one moment. Oh! Forgot.

973
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,640
This is for you, dear. This is for you to
remember every time you leave the house.

974
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,000
- Uh, I showed it to her earlier.
- It's a list that I...

975
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,600
- I... It's written down, and I see it. - All
right. Good. All right, honey. - Okay. Bye.

976
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,120
- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

977
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,840
Goodbye...
Do you smell gas?

978
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,640
- Drive safe.
- Bye. - Bye!

979
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,000
And don't worry!

980
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,640
<i>I'm free to do what I want</i>

981
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,200
<i>Any old time</i>

982
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,320
<i>I said, I'm free
to do what I want</i>

983
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,160
<i>Any old time</i>

984
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,080
Hello.
This is my apartment.

985
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,200
Would you like to sit down?

986
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:39,480
<i>I say, love me, hold me</i>

987
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,520
<i>'Cause I'm free</i>

988
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,560
<i>To do what I want</i>

989
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,040

01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,640

<i>Any old time</i>

994
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,360
Listen up, everybody. The Falcon Bar
presents body shots at table number 4.

995
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,080
- Body! Body! Body! Body!
- My turn!

996
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,240
Body! Body! Body! Body!

997
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,280
Body! Body! Body! Body!

998
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,640
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

999
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,400
The regular... regular couples
don't do that, Daniel.

1000
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,600
- They're from college.
- Yeah.

1001
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,520
- Huh.
- Yeah.

1002
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,800
Daniel, I want us to be friends...

1003
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,040
for a really long time.

1004
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,960
Um, well, I-I don't think so.

1005
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,600
Why not?

1006
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,000
Uh, well, j-just 'cause
I... I may have to move to Florida.

1007
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,320
- Why?
- To live with my mom.

1008
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,960
You have to leave?

1009
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,760
Well, uh...

1010
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,240
'C-Cause my dad
won't pay my rent any more...

1011
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,640
'cause I...
'cause I failed my classes.

1012
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,960
So, um, after the new year's
I have to go...

1013
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,520
because... 'cause... 'cause I only make
350 dollars a month...

1014
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,720
and... and my... and my rent's
500 dollars a month.

1015
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,280
<i>Mrs Robinson,
you're trying to seduce me.</i>

1016
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,680
<i>Aren't you?</i>

1017
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,840
<i>Well, no.
I hadn't thought of it.</i>

1018
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,640
<i>- I feel very flattered.
- Mrs Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?</i>

1019
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,080
<i>- It's all right.
- It's not all right. It's the worst thing I ever...</i>

1020
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,000
What's the... What's the matter?

1021
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:52,320
Strange things are...
are happening to my body.

1022
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,560
Me too.

1023
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,520
I kinda feel like...

1024
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,400
we should be doing something more
than kissing.

1025
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,880
Me too.

1026
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,760
What did they do
after they kissed?

1027
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,200
They do it,
and then he smiles...

1028
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,120
and then she...
and she smokes a cigarette.

1029
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,520
Mmm, but I don't like smoking.

1030
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,680
Uh, w-well, me neither.
But, uh... I just like to smile.

1031
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,520
But... Yeah, I know.
Doing it. Sure.

1032
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,440
Yeah.

1033
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,440
Did you ever?

1034
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,040
Oh, I...

1035
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,360
Oh, sort of, I did it.

1036
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,240
- But you sort of what?
- Well, it's just 'cause I was with a bunch... some older guys...

1037
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,480
a- a-and they... they all chipped in
and they paid this girl...

1038
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,960
and she had... she had a reputation...

1039
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,520
to... to kiss me,
and then, and then, you know...

1040
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,600
and do some other stuff, you know.

1041
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,200
And then... And then...

1042
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,240
And then what?

1043
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,560
Well, i... it's just that there was...
there was a lot of kissing...

1044
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,360
and there was a...
there was a lot of, um, hugging...

1045
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,000
and there was a...
there was a lot of rubbing.

1046
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,720
And then... See, 'cause the thing was, I...
'Cause I finished before I was supposed to. See?

1047
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,440
'Cause I... You know.
You have to be a guy to understand that.

1048
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,640
- 'Cause, see... 'Cause guys and girls are different.
- Daniel.

1049
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,280
- Guys have a thing.
- Did you love her?

1050
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,480
I sure...
Well, I sure thought I did.

1051
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,520
Hmm.

1052
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,640
But not... not like I love you.

1053
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,400
'Cause I... I... I...
I love you every minute.

1054
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,040
I love you more than band music...

1055
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,960
and cookie-making.

1056
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,480
That's... That's a stupid thing
to say, I know, I...

1057
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,680
No.

1058
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,600
That's the first time...

1059
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,720
anybody's ever
said that to me before.

1060
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,800
I love you too, Daniel McMahon.

1061
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,120
I don't want you to leave.

1062
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:51,040
Me neither.

1063
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,600
The reason I'm always saying no to you
is because of what you ask for, Carla.

1064
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,160
But Daniel
never asked for the money.

1065
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,040
- He would just come and move in with me.
- That's the same as asking for money.

1066
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,160
But it's my idea.

1067
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,280
- And, see, his rent is $500, and he can't afford it, Mom.
- Honey. Carla.

1068
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,400
Carla, he cannot move in with you.

1069
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,840
- But it's my place.
- No, it is not your place.

1070
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,000
It is the person who pays for the rent.
That is the boss of the apartment.

1071
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,920
B- But Dad pays the bills here,
and you're the boss.

1072
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,720
That's different.
Radley, please.

1073
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:29,560
- Dad, tell Mom that it's not very different.
- Please.

1074
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,360
Honey, your mom is right
on this one.

1075
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,520
Oh, really.

1076
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,720
- Mom is right.
- Oh, pumpkin.

1077
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,920
I'm telling you,
that boy sees her as a rich girl.

1078
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:50,360
Well, she is a rich girl,
but I don't think he's after her money.

1079
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,360
But seriously,
aren't you concerned?

1080
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,360
Carla is young,
she's full of love.

1081
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,640
This is the first love she's ever had.
She's feeling that for the first time.

1082
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,760
This is just a harmless
flirtation, a crush.

1083
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,560
That's all it is.

1084
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,520
So, we can do...

1085
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:11,800
Or we could try, um, page 39.

1086
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,240
I marked that.

1087
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:17,360
And page 84...

1088
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,320
is okay.

1089
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,880
But I don't want to do page 155...

1090
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,480
But... I... If I...
If I remember correctly...

1091
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:31,000
t- t-there's a page...
it's, uh, 146.

1092
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,840
And i-i... it looks pretty good.

1093
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,520
How much do you weigh?

1094
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,800
Uh, well, let's see. L... I-I...
See, 'cause... 'cause I weigh 145...

1095
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,280
and four ounces.

1096
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,240
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

1097
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:56,120
- Well, that sounds okay.
- Yeah. See... Yeah.

1098
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,640
So, d-do you want to do it now?

1099
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,360
'Cause I... I got the, um...

1100
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,040
I got protection...

1101
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:15,360
at the family planning place.

1102
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:20,120
And, uh... See- See, 'cause, uh... I...
I even got ones that glow in the dark.

1103
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,760
And... And... And see, they... 'cause
they made me practise on a banana.

1104
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,120
- Do you want me to show you how to do it?
- No.

1105
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,000
Okay.

1106
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,160
So, are you ready?

1107
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,720
'Cause, 'cause I'm ready.

1108
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,760
Ready?

1109
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,200
Are you r-ready?

1110
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,400
Come on, 'cause... 'cause we can do it
in the... in the bedroom, if you want.

1111
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,280
No, I'm not ready.

1112
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,960
L... Daniel.

1113
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,760
I don't want to do it right now.

1114
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,880
I was thinking that we could wait
till the next holiday...

1115
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,920
because holidays are special...

1116
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,120
and Thanksgiving
is coming up soon...

1117
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:15,000
Oh, 'cause, uh,
I feel special right now, Carla.

1118
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,320
But Thanksgiving, there's a turkey
and there's more than two desserts.

1119
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,080
Yeah.

1120
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,080
It's like a magic.

1121
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,880
- Oh.
- But I don't... I don't wanna do it now.

1122
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,360
- Uh...
- Well, let's get your bike.

1123
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,440
So I just save these
for Thanksgiving, right?

1124
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,240
- Yeah, Thanksgiving.
- Yeah. Okay.

1125
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:44,200
<i>You always tell me</i>

1126
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,560
<i>That it's impossible</i>

1127
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,280
<i>To be respected</i>

1128
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,480
<i>And be a girl</i>

1129
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,800
<i>Please be careful with me</i>

1130
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,640
<i>I'm sensitive</i>

1131
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,640
<i>And I'd like to stay that way</i>

1132
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,160
- Very careful. Good girl. That's right. It's hot.
- Wow.

1133
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,080
- Oh, that looks good.
- Looks good.

1134
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,000
Put it down over here,
'cause this is nice, cold marble.

1135
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,640
Yes!

1136
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,320
Good! That's good. All right, now curl
your fingers. Don't get your fingers in.

1137
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:29,120
And we thank You that we are all here together
again for the first time in many years...

1138
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:33,560
making this a Thanksgiving
for each of us to remember.

1139
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,360
Amen.

1140
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,200
- Potatoes.
- Good.

1141
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,080
So, Caroline, please tell me how,
with your horrible temper...

1142
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,000
you think you're going to be able
to manage teaching second grade.

1143
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,320
- Oh, don't talk like that about your sister.
- I don't have a horrible temper.

1144
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,080
- I love children. - She's a good
teacher. - I just get mad at adults.

1145
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,280
- Mm-hmm. And her sister, occasionally.
- Thanks, Winnie.

1146
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,200
- Yeah!
- Oh, just occasionally her sister.

1147
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,960
- Have you seen her temper?
- But, Carla, do you know what I did?

1148
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,000
- Are we almost done?
- What's your hurry?

1149
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,920
Carla, why are you in such a hurry?

1150
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,560
I don't want to get home too late.

1151
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,440
Yes, Mom,
I took all the right buses.

1152
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,160
Will you thank Winnie
for making me the food bundle?

1153
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,160
Okay, good night, Mom.

1154
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,080
Happy Thanksgiving.

1155
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,960
<i>John Elway recovers
on the 13-yard line!</i>

1156
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,440
This is so good.

1157
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,920
It's, uh... Uh, this is...
Last year...

1158
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,000
Uh, last year,
um, I ate tids and bits...

1159
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,760
and it... and it just... it just doesn't
have that Thanksgiving feeling.

1160
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,320
Yeah.

1161
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:45,920
Well, Winnie made everything
except the sweet potatoes.

1162
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:49,280
I made that and put
all the little marshmallows on top.

1163
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,120
Oh, 'cause...
'cause that was my favourite part.

1164
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,080
- Eh, no, it wasn't.
- Yeah, it was.

1165
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,600
Well, I'm stuffed.

1166
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,720
Well, it's... it's Thanksgiving. Remember the...
'm-m-member what we said we were gonna do on Thanksgiving?

1167
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1168
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,920
I wonder who thought up sex
in the first place, Daniel.

1169
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,480
L- I-I think it was Madonna,
actually.

1170
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,240
But, Daniel...

1171
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,160
I'm kind of scared.

1172
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,200
Well, you... you don't
have to be scared, Carla.

1173
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,120
'Cause you know why?

1174
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,600
'Cause I would...
'Cause I would never hurt you.

1175
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:51,440
'Cause you... you're the last person
in the world that I'd ever hurt.

1176
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,600
Okay.

1177
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,600
- Carla?
- Just a second.

1178
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,120
That's nice underwear.

1179
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,040
Yeah.

1180
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,920
I got it from my sister's closet.

1181
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:12,320
I've never been naked
in front of anyone before.

1182
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,040
Just you.

1183
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,320
Should we have some music,
Daniel?

1184
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,320
Uh, i-i-it's okay.
I'll get some music.

1185
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,240
Okay.

1186
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,200
I know why you're smiling.

1187
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:18,520
- Why?
- When someone smiles like that, they're in love.

1188
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,200
Really?

1189
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,520
Oh, Carla, there you are. You know, I've
got some new art books for you to look at.

1190
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,800
And I want you to select a few paintings
that we can discuss later. All right?

1191
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,600
- Yeah.
- All right.

1192
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,160
- Well, I like "The Lace Maker. "
- Mm-hmm.

1193
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,920
And this one right here.

1194
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,040
That's the famous
"Girl with the Red Hat. "

1195
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,960
- That's such a pretty painting.
- She...

1196
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:50,040
But I think we should look at our Sister Wendy, because
she's going to be in Florence this week. I'm very excited.

1197
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:54,840
<i>I'm going on a grand tour in search of some
of the finest art treasures in the world.</i>

1198
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,720
What are...
You know something?

1199
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,760
- What?
- You look different to me, dear.

1200
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,440
<i>- What's going on, huh?
- Beginning my grand tour in Florence.</i>

1201
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,880
Strange.

1202
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,960
<i>...and sometimes played at funerals.</i>

1203
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,840
Um...

1204
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,280
Hello?

1205
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,240
Oh, hi, Dad.

1206
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,720
Yeah. Um, wait.

1207
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,560
Uh, well, I was... I was wondering
i- if... if you could change your mind...

1208
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,080
a- a-about not giving me the money,
just 'cause...

1209
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,560
just 'cause I...
I met this girl and then...

1210
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,480
Um...

1211
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,720
Oh, y-yeah.

1212
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,280
Well, Dad, just... Wh... Uh...

1213
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:49,800
What about just giving me, uh, enough... enough money just
until I... I fi... I find a better job that... that pays...

1214
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,960
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1215
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,000
Okay... Yeah, 'cause it...
It's just that sometimes I forget.

1216
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,360
Yeah.

1217
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,360
Um, yeah, I m... I miss you too.

1218
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,760
Uh, I'm, uh...

1219
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,680
How... How are you, Da...

1220
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,560
Okay, bye.

1221
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,800
<i>If you're happy and you know it
clap your hands</i>

1222
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,600
<i>If you're happy and you know it
clap your hands</i>

1223
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,880
<i>If you're happy...</i>

1224
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,280
Oh, I know what you guys
are gonna do tonight.

1225
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:49,080
Hey, the Daniel McMahon bike rack.

1226
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,040
Hey!
Take that bike off my porch!

1227
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:56,440
<i>If you're happy and you know it
clap your hands</i>

1228
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,920
Ernie! Ernie!

1229
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,120
Thank you, San Francisco!

1230
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,800
Thank you, Elvis McMahon.

1231
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,440
Ernie!

1232
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,760
The Spanish mustang!

1233
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,120
- Uh, hey, that smells like a good year, pal. Come on. Come on inside.
- Well, I...

1234
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,600
I love Carla, Ernie.
Carla loves me. There's a fact.

1235
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,800
Okay, most people at school
make fun of me...

1236
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,520
and they... and they... and they never...
and they never talk to me, Ernie.

1237
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,320
They never, ever talk to me.

1238
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:42,240
And she... she... 'Cause she's the... she's
the only one that makes me feel like a person.

1239
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,920
- Oh, come on, now.
- To Carla!

1240
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,880
Now... Now... Come on, now!
Now, that's... All right. Here.

1241
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,760
- Let's go... What's that? What's that?
- Got ya.

1242
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,200
- Aw, Ernie!
- See how I did that?

1243
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,600
- I love to drink, Ernie.
- Oh, yeah? Come on.

1244
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,240
- Yeah. It makes me feel good.
- Oh, yeah?

1245
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,720
Yeah. Wait, is that...
is that why people drink?

1246
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,640
Oh, people drink
for lots of reasons.

1247
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,840
Some to be happy, some to forget,
some to be brave.

1248
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,280
I think... I think I wanna...
I think I wanna be brave, Ernie.

1249
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,600
No. Only cowards
get brave that way.

1250
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,200
Forget drinking.
Forget all that stuff.

1251
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,600
You gotta find what makes you happy.
Danny, what makes you happy?

1252
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:20,000
Uh...

1253
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,880
- Come on. What makes you happy?
- I wanna... I wanna take a ride in your Mustang.

1254
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,440
That's, uh...
That'd make me really happy, Ernie.

1255
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,600
You never did that, and that...
t- t-that would make me very happy.

1256
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,440
No, I can't take that car out in winter
weather. It'll ruin her paint job.

1257
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,840
Some other time. Anything else
would make you happy? Come on.

1258
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,560
Yeah.

1259
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,840
Help me... Help me find a job
so that I can be with Carla forever.

1260
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,360
I'm sorry your father
won't change his mind.

1261
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,120
See, he s... he s... he said
he'd paid for me long enough...

1262
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,840
and that he... he said...
he said it's my mother's turn.

1263
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,800
I'm very angry right now, Ernie.

1264
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,680
Oh, I can understand anger.
I know about that.

1265
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,560
No! No, no, no, no. Easy now.
There. Easy. Come on, now, easy.

1266
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,800
Watch my guitar.
Now, easy.

1267
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,240
You know what I do sometimes
when I get angry? You know what I do?

1268
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,240
I call up a buddy.
I call a pal. Hmm? See?

1269
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:21,080
And, uh, somethin' like this.
How are ya? See?

1270
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,000
That's it. That...

1271
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,680
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1272
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,120
Yeah?
That's it. See? See?

1273
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,080
- Yeah.
- Patting. Patting is good.

1274
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,320
P... Patting. That's it.

1275
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,680
Heather!

1276
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,960
All right, guys, what do we think
about this for the country club, hmm?

1277
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,000
- Mm-hmm. That is so chic.
- Very.

1278
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,560
- Where'd you get that?
- At Michelle's, uh, Soho boutique, actually.

1279
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,680
Where is Carla?
We're gonna be late, aren't we?

1280
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,480
You know what? You always do that,
Mother. You know who she is.

1281
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,400
- She's the one... - Oh, please. -
That you refer to as my special friend.

1282
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,080
- Ohh.
- All right, tension alert.

1283
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,280
You know what? Honey, why don't you go
start the car, and I'm gonna go find Carla...

1284
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,520
- and you...
- Mmm.

1285
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,560
Wait, Mother,
you never even met Michelle.

1286
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:08,400
- Come on!
- I cannot believe it. You're still doing the look.

1287
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,520
- Oh, wow. Dad, she's still doing the look.
- Look...

1288
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:13,760
- You know what? - I just... - Mother,
we've had this conversation several times.

1289
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,800
- I don't wanna have it any more.
- I just hope you outgrow it, that's all.

1290
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,840
Yeah, a-and I'd hoped
you'd accept it.

1291
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,120
Mother, being gay
is not a diagnosis.

1292
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,600
It's not a disease I'm going to recover
from or a phase I'm going to outgrow.

1293
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,680
I know what being gay is, okay?

1294
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,040
I give to gay causes. I support gay
parades. They even gave me a plaque.

1295
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,440
Yes. So why support them
and not me?

1296
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,800
- Because I'm not their mother.
- Yes, I know this. You're mine.

1297
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,480
So why can't you just say it?
I have a gay daughter.

1298
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,280
<i>- I have a gay daughter.
- It's not like I'm asking you to go on Oprah, mother. Just say it to me.</i>

1299
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,240
- Oh, look at this. - I have. - Look at
this evolution coming down the stairs.

1300
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,880
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Ohh.

1301
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,440
Caroline and Heather did my make-up.
Both sides.

1302
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:55,240
Oh, yeah. Look at that. Well, honey,
let's... Uh, the limousine is waiting for you.

1303
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,640
- Let's go out there, princess... -
Ohh, beauty. - And slip into your...

1304
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,600
Carla. Your gentleman caller
just arrived. He's on the porch.

1305
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,320
- Oh, your Prince Charming. Let's go find Prince Charming.
- Ohh... Oh, it's Daniel!

1306
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,240
- We're gonna check on the limo.
- All right.

1307
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,960
- I'll put his bike away.
- This earring is driving me crazy.

1308
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,760
I can't take it. I'm not...
I'm never gonna wear it again.

1309
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,920
- Hi.
- Wow.

1310
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,240
You look really handsome.

1311
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,720
Yeah, you look r-really pretty.

1312
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,240
Oh. Did you talk to your dad yet?

1313
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:27,000
Oh, n... Well, 'cause I... 'cause I
don't... I- I-I don't need my dad any more...

1314
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,120
'cause I...
'cause I have an idea for... for us.

1315
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,760
I knew you'd come up
with something.

1316
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,680
- Yeah.
- We're coming, Dad!

1317
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,320
<i>- Okay!
- So deck the halls with boughs of holly</i>

1318
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:45,160
<i>- 'Tis the season to bejolly
- To bejolly</i>

1319
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,160
<i>Yeah, don we now our gay apparel</i>

1320
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,480
<i>- It's Christmas time

1321
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,520
- You know my mother Pucky.
- Of course I know Pucky.

1322
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,400
So, how are the plans going
for Caroline's wedding?

1323
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,480
- We're excited.
- What about you, Heather?

1324
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,200
- Any young chaps on the horizon for you yet?
- Oh!

1325
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,160
You know what? No. You know, the literary
world is just a lot of reclusive writers...

1326
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,160
and, you know,
serial killers, so...

1327
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,280
- Caroline, where's the wedding going to be?
- It's gonna be at St John's Church.

1328
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,360
- Oh, right here in Sutter Hills.
- Uh, New Zealand.

1329
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:25,200
- Hey.
- It's not in New Zealand, Jeff.

1330
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,800
It's in Sutter Hills.

1331
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,840
Carla...

1332
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,200
I- I-I'm kind of afraid
of your family.

1333
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,360
I feel that way too
sometimes, Daniel.

1334
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,280
- You do?
- Yeah.

1335
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,960
But all you have to do
is be brave...

1336
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,600
and then you could say
anything you want...

1337
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,720
'cause you feel more comfortable.

1338
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:53,600
E- Excuse me, I'll be...
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

1339
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,080
- Here you are, sir.
- Very nice bottle.

1340
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,200
Yes, sir, you picked
a very nice bottle. Green.

1341
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,880
So that...
So that'll make me very brave?

1342
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Sir, it's 110 proof.
It'll make you very brave.

1343
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,160
- Thank you.
- Thank you, and merry Christmas.

1344
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:14,080
Yes, it is.

1345
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,760
Thank you, Martin.

1346
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,160
My publishing company
is going to merge next month.

1347
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,840
Ah, Dr Longhurst,
master of the root canal.

1348
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,320
- Elizabeth. Elizabeth Russell.
- Mmm.

1349
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:35,280
That's that young dental hygienist
who married the Tate boy.

1350
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,360
- You know, Ridley?
- Radley.

1351
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,280
- Radley.
- I should've married him.

1352
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,200
His father Orson built this club.

1353
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,040
Oh, Carla, did you receive that
Dustin Hoffman book that I sent you?

1354
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:48,200
Yeah. I'm going to give it
to Daniel for Christmas.

1355
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,680
Don't tell Ernie.

1356
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,920
- I don't know any Ernie.
- Good.

1357
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,840
- Merry Christmas.
- It still is.

1358
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,600
Carla, come here.

1359
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,200
- Sit down there. This is a surprise.
- Where is... Where is Daniel?

1360
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,320
He's missing everything.

1361
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,400
Ladies and gentlemen, everybody,
may I have your attention, please?

1362
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,480
Olive juice.

1363
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,000
- Some months ago...
- What are you saying?

1364
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,680
- Olive juice.
- While I was soliciting petition signatures at a sorority house...

1365
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,800
- Why?
- Because from far away...

1366
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,160
- I had this wonderful...
- it looks like "I love you. "

1367
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,080
That's a very good trick!

1368
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,920
And if I said it was love at first
sight, that would be disingenuous.

1369
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,640
- "Disin... " What?
- Untruthful. - Oh.

1370
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:43,960
She had just come back from a softball game and
had the worst case of hat hair I've ever seen.

1371
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,880
Je... Oh, my God.

1372
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,920
It looked terminal.

1373
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,040
"Hat hair. "

1374
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:55,320
But Cupid's arrows
overcame her dishevelled coif...

1375
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,680
and I did fall in love with her,
very much in love.

1376
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,560
And next month
she's going to make me...

1377
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:05,440
the happiest man alive
by becoming my wife.

1378
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:10,080
And now I would like to dance
to our favourite song...

1379
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,000
"Baby, I'm Yours. "

1380
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,400
My favourite song is
"Michelle, My Belle. "

1381
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,520
- What? What did you say?
- Nothing.

1382
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:27,360
<i>- Baby, I'm yours
- Baby, I'm yours</i>

1383
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:29,520
<i>- And I'll be yours
- Yours</i>

1384
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:36,320
<i>Until the stars
fall from the sky</i>

1385
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:41,920
<i>Yours until the rivers
all run dry</i>

1386
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:46,560
<i>In other words, until I die</i>

1387
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,440
<i>- Baby, I'm yours
- Hi.</i>

1388
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,600
Uh, I just... C-Caroline and Jeff...

1389
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,880
w- would you mind
j- j-just to sit down for ju...

1390
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,480
Olive juice.

1391
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,200
Could you sit down as well?

1392
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,840
- Just give him a minute.
- He might...

1393
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:10,280
- All right, let's just see what he has to say.
- Maybe he has a surprise.

1394
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,160
My name is Daniel McMahon...

1395
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:18,480
and I... I'm in love
with a girl too.

1396
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,000
A- A-A-And she...
she does not have hat hair.

1397
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:38,520
- That's was a joke, Mom. - He's a stand-up
comic. It was a good joke. - Mmm. Yes.

1398
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:41,800
Her... Her- Her na...
Her name is Carla Tate...

1399
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,200
and she love... s-s-she loves me too.

1400
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,760
And I have never had that before.

1401
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,560
And my... my dad...

1402
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,440
is... is, uh...
he's gonna send me to Florida.

1403
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,680
And I want her to...
I w-w-want her to come along with me.

1404
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,000
Oh! Wow!

1405
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,840
- That is out of the question.
- He's just kidding.

1406
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,920
- That is out... - Please. - Excuse me. Look
what I've done. - He's just kidding, dear.

1407
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,520
He's full of surprises, Mom.

1408
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,760
And we love each other so much...

1409
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,480
that last Thanksgiving...

1410
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,680
we did it.

1411
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:36,080
And it was... it was so beautiful.

1412
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:39,280
- That is not what... But he's
saying that... - Daddy. - Mark.

1413
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,360
- Daddy, please go up there and do
something. - B-But, Mom... - O-O-Okay.

1414
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:45,200
- I'd like to sing a song for her. - That's not what he
was saying... - It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

1415
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:47,840
And here's our song.

1416
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:51,760
<i>Seventy-six trombones
led the big parade</i>

1417
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,160
No, that's not
what it is, what...

1418
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:59,080
<i>With 110 cornets close at hand</i>

1419
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,280
Stop laughing!
Stop laughing at me!

1420
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:06,680
Stop laughing at me!
You stop laughing at me!

1421
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,280
- Honey. Honey. Honey.
- That's not funny, Daniel!

1422
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:14,160
Honey... Baby, please...
Baby. Baby, baby. It's okay.

1423
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,720
- It's all right.
- Stop laughing at me!

1424
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,000
Sir. Sir, if you would
kindly step this way, sir.

1425
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,600
Step this way, sir, please.
Uh, everybody dance, please!

1426
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,520
Play something.

1427
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,640
All right, Jeff, get the girls home.
We'll call you later.

1428
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:39,760
- I hate what he did.
- Calm down. I know.

1429
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:41,280
- I know, I know, dear.
- Charles!

1430
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,640
- Now, just get in this car, sit down... - Where
the hell is he? - Sit down and relax. Why did...

1431
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,560
- I don't know where Charles is. Is she okay?
- Where is he?

1432
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,280
- I think he's probably in the restroom. -
Well... - Gary, did you see our limousine driver?

1433
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,080
Carla, Carla, I'll be right back.
Just sit right there.

1434
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,280
Oh, for God's sake!
Where is that man?

1435
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,680
- Is she all right?
- Yes, she's fine!

1436
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:03,200
Carla. Carla.

1437
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:08,600
Why did you do that, Daniel?

1438
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:13,240
- I'm s... I'm sorry.
- Why did you tell everybody our love secrets?

1439
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:16,240
- I'm sorry, Car...
- No!

1440
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:21,400
You made everyone laugh at me!

1441
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,760
I'm sorry, Carla. I never... I don't... I
mean, I don't think everybody laughed at you.

1442
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:29,280
I don't care if you're sorry,
Daniel!

1443
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,760
God!

1444
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,680
You're stupid!

1445
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:39,040
What you did was stupid,
and I don't want to ever see you again!

1446
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,320
So? I don't even care!

1447
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,240
I never... I don't care!

1448
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:48,600
I never... I don...
I don't wanna see you either!

1449
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,880
- Shut up! Leave me alone!
- I think you're stupid too!

1450
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,400
- I think that you're really stupid!
- Carla!

1451
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,760
- I want you to leave me alone!
- Carla!

1452
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,720
- Mom, make him leave
me alone. - Here. - Whoa!

1453
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:01,400
- No, no, no. No, no. - Charles,
get her in the car. - You're stupid!

1454
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,640
- No, I'm not stupid. - I'm not...
I'm not stupid! - Just go in.

1455
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:06,320
- Gary! Make sure he gets home!
- I'm not... I'm not stupid!

1456
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,440
- Get a cab. Get him home.
- I don't love him.

1457
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,440
- I know.
- You're stupid.

1458
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,840
- Go home, Danny. Just get in.
- Here. Good.

1459
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,720
<i>'Round yon virgin
Mother and child</i>

1460
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,800
- Let's go, Charles.
- We'll be out of here in a minute, Dr Tate.

1461
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:25,600
<i>Holy infant
so tender and mild</i>

1462
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:33,080
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

1463
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:36,240
<i>Sleep in heavenly</i>

1464
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,600
<i>- Why did he do it?
- Peace</i>

1465
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:42,160
Danny had too much to drink and he
didn't know what he was saying, pumpkin.

1466
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,360
He didn't mean to embarrass you.

1467
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:49,680
Everything is going to be fine.
It's all going to work out in the end.

1468
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,520
<i>I don't understand</i>

1469
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,360
<i>How the sun keeps shinin'</i>

1470
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,920
<i>And I don't understand</i>

1471
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,280
<i>Why the seasons change</i>

1472
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,200
Oh, he's fine.
Yeah, he's a friend of the band.

1473
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:17,200
<i>- And I don't have a clue
- Oh, yeah. That's the kid who's leaving.</i>

1474
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:21,160
<i>What makes the rivers flow</i>

1475
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,680
<i>Loving you is all I know</i>

1476
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,360
<i>I can't tell you why</i>

1477
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:34,720
<i>The stars come out
in the evenin'</i>

1478
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:39,560
<i>And I can't tell you
where they go</i>

1479
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,640
<i>When they're gone</i>

1480
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:47,400
<i>And I don't have a clue</i>

1481
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,480
<i>What makes a flower grow</i>

1482
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,920
<i>Loving you is all I know</i>

1483
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:01,520
<i>I don't know how the world
keeps on spinnin' 'round</i>

1484
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:05,200
<i>I don't know why the sky
don't come fallin'down</i>

1485
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:08,360
<i>I just know that I would die</i>

1486
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:12,560
<i>Without your touch, oh</i>

1487
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:16,560
<i>I don't know why the tide
needs to reach the shore</i>

1488
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:21,360
<i>I just know that I need you
for forevermore</i>

1489
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:26,320
<i>- Knowin'that I get inside our love
- All aboard!</i>

1490
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,840
<i>I don't understand</i>

1491
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,720
<i>How the sun keeps shinin'</i>

1492
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:38,480
<i>I don't understand</i>

1493
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:42,960
<i>Why the seasons change
and change and change</i>

1494
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,640
<i>And I don't have a clue</i>

1495
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:51,600
<i>What
What makes the rivers flow</i>

1496
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:55,680
<i>Loving you is all I know</i>

1497
01:34:55,800 --> 01:35:02,640
<i>Is all I know, is all I know
Is all I know</i>

1498
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:08,560
<i>Loving you is all I know</i>

1499
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,840
All right,
let's start the rehearsal.

1500
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:15,320
The groomsmen over here, and we'll
have the bridesmaids come up and...

1501
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,160
Excuse me, but are they going
to continue to act like clowns?

1502
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,080
Well, they're just having fun.
They're good guys.

1503
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,160
- All right, excuse me.
- Ohh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

1504
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,760
I'm so sorry, but, you know,
Cousin Anne...

1505
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:29,920
she was not exactly thrilled
with her hotel accommodations.

1506
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:34,080
- Hi. - Okay. - Not that she has
any idea what a hotel accommo... Oh.

1507
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,520
- I'm sorry, who is... Are you a groomsman?
- No. This is my assistant Mark.

1508
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:41,240
Okay. Cousin Anne's very happy.
Let's move on.

1509
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,440
- All right. - Let's do move on,
all right? - Excellent. All right.

1510
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,360
- Everybody, we're gonna start with a...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

1511
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:48,680
Would you mind if I had just a few
minutes alone with my family, please?

1512
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,120
- Fine. - Thank
you. - Okay, listen.

1513
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:54,000
- I'd just like to say that the only reason
I'm even here... - Oh, Heather. - Huh?

1514
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:57,040
Is because it's Caroline's dream to have
all of her sisters at her wedding.

1515
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:00,520
But this might be the very last time I
attend a family function without Michelle.

1516
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:03,120
Duly noted. Let's rehearse, okay?
Come on. Let's go. Let's rehearse.

1517
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:06,720
- Yeah, and if Daniel is not here...
- Dad, I mean it.

1518
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,960
- I have no one to dance with, Mom. - You have someone you can
dance with, honey, right here. - We'll talk about this, okay? Shh.

1519
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,600
You can dance with your cousin Theodore.
I'm sure he would love to dance with you.

1520
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:16,920
You know... Hello! Guys! This... It's, like,
Danny, Michelle... Would you give me a break here?

1521
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,960
It's the middle child's wedding.
You know what I'm saying?

1522
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,040
- The middle child's wedding. I am the middle
child. - Caroline. - Honey. Caroline, honey.

1523
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,680
- Honey, we know that. - My wedd...
No! - No, no, excuse me. - Calm down.

1524
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,160
- I think it's just as important that I have somebody here that I want here. That's all I'm saying.
- All you do... Danny and Michelle...

1525
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,840
- My wedding comes once in a lifetime.
- Listen to me for one minute.

1526
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,440
- Come here. Come here. - This
is ridiculous. - Listen to me.

1527
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,640
- Be quiet! - Please.
Everybody, please. - Shh!

1528
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:37,360
This is a Tate family wedding.
I'm very proud of that.

1529
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,440
And, Caroline,
I'm very proud of you.

1530
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,000
But we have hundreds of guests
and family who are attending...

1531
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:46,680
so I think it would behove us
to suppress the minutiae...

1532
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,040
long enough to show everybody
how proud we are to be Tate family.

1533
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:54,000
- Now, let's rehearse.
- Well said. Well said.

1534
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,960
<i>But my favourite actor's Dustin Hoffman. Did... Did
you... Did you ever see that movie, The Graduate?</i>

1535
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,720
Is that the one where, uh, he's in a
dress, or is that the one with the camels?

1536
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,680
- Deming. This station is Deming. Next stop is El Paso.
- And then... And then...

1537
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:13,440
And then s-she goes off to get, get married
to somebody else, and see... and see...

1538
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,440
Dustin knows
that she still loves him.

1539
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,040
A- A-And...

1540
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,920
And then he gets
all confused and, and mixed up...

1541
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:25,440
and then... and then he goes
and he tries to rescue her.

1542
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,200
All aboard!

1543
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:41,360
All aboard!

1544
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:45,800
<i>- Do, do-do-do, do-do do-do, do-do-do-do,
do - O-Okay. Okay, bye! I'll see you later.</i>

1545
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:48,200
Nice talking to you.

1546
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:06,440
Uh... I-I-I
was going to Florida...

1547
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,200
and I-I-I changed my mind, and I want...
I wanna go back to San Francisco.

1548
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,920
<i>Do, do-do-do, do-do
do-do, do-do-do-do, do</i>

1549
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:15,280
You want to exchange
your ticket?

1550
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,600
Yes! Yes, I want...
Um, okay. Okay.

1551
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,280
<i>And here's to you
Mrs Robinson</i>

1552
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:30,240
<i>Jesus loves you more than you will know
Hey, hey, hey</i>

1553
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:33,120
<i>- Do Flipper! - God, you're
a freak. - Hey, hey, hey</i>

1554
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:37,960
- Yea! Yeah! Do more, Heather.
- No.

1555
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:41,960
I'm not doing any more. Can we just
play, like, another game or something?

1556
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,640
Yeah, but I don't wanna play...

1557
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:47,680
Pin the Penis
on the Naked Guy again.

1558
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:50,720
- Yeah, I'll second that.
- Come on, you guys! This is fun.

1559
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:53,520
I mean, we gotta have fun.
This is my last night single.

1560
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,640
<i>God bless you, please
Mrs Robinson</i>

1561
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,120
<i>Heaven holds a place
for those who pray</i>

1562
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:03,920
<i>Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey</i>

1563
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:07,440
- You go, Carla.
- Okay. Now it's my turn.

1564
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:10,160
I wish I could
see Daniel again.

1565
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:12,360
- Oh, Carla, don't be sad.
- Oh, Carla, don't get sad.

1566
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,480
- Come on. You gotta be happy. This is my sisters happy night thing.
- No.

1567
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:20,520
But I wish I could see him
again just for a little second...

1568
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:23,520
to tell him
that I don't hate him.

1569
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:26,920
<i>Where have you gone
Joe DiMaggio</i>

1570

<i>A nation's turns

<i>What's that you say
Mrs Robinson</i>

1573
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:39,240
<i>Joltin'Joe has left
and gone away</i>

1574

<i>Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey</i>

1575
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:09,160
Hi. You look like you need a ride.
Come on. Dad says it's okay.

1576
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,440
- O-Okay.
- Hi. I'm Jenny.

1577
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,840
- You want a pretzel or a marshmallow?
- Yeah, thank you.

1578
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:16,240
I'm really hungry.

1579
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:26,280
Who presents this woman
to be married?

1580
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,320
- We do.
- We do.

1581
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:31,640
- Please be seated.
- Okay.

1582
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,320
Thanks, Fred!
Thanks for the ride!

1583
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:49,440
Excuse me. The soup kitchen
is around in the parish hall.

1584
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:51,720
But it won't be open until 5:00.

1585
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,920
But I-I, see, I don't...
I don't want any soup.

1586
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,840
- L-I came to see a girl in the wedding.
- I don't think so.

1587
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,000
- But can I... Carla...
- I said I don't think so.

1588
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:03,400
Okay.

1589
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:08,440
I give you this ring
as a symbol of my vow.

1590
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,200
I give you this ring
as a symbol of my vow.

1591
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:14,440
And with all that I am
and all that I have...

1592
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,160
And with all that I am
and all that I have...

1593
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,640
I honour you
in the name of God.

1594
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,560
I honour you
in the name of God.

1595
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,240
The union of husband
and wife in heart...

1596
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,320
body and mind is...

1597
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,080
- Ginger. - What?
- Intended...

1598
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:35,360
- by God for their mutual joy. - Did you
just throw something at my head? - No.

1599
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:38,600
And for the health
and-and comfort...

1600
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,720
gi... given one another in...

1601
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,720
- prosperity... - Radley, what is
going on? - Someone's throwing...

1602
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,320
Well, what on Earth
is this happening?

1603
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:47,400
And for the gift
and heritage of children.

1604
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,720
- Is this your idea of a joke?
- They are laughing right now...

1605
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,400
- Please, this is not funny.
- At the wedding.

1606
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:56,360
But to reverently and
deliberately in accordance...

1607
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,960
with the purposes for which
it was instituted by God.

1608
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,840
Danny?

1609
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,800
Daniel.

1610
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:11,600
- Carla Tate.
- Daniel!

1611
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,840
- What?
- Oh, my God, it's Daniel.

1612
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:15,600
Meet you out front
in the lobby.

1613
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:19,320
Mark, the homeless boy
is up in the organ balcony.

1614
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,360
I'm gonna go back down.

1615
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,520
- What are they up to?
- Okay.

1616
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:31,360
- Don't make trouble.
- Whoa!

1617
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,760
- No. Is he all right?
- Daniel? Are you okay?

1618
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:46,040
I think...
He seems to be okay.

1619
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:49,760
I don't wanna be apart
ever again, Daniel.

1620
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:52,120
- Yeah, never again.
- I love you.

1621
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,240
Carla, Carla.

1622
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,880
I wa-wa-want to get married.

1623
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:01,080
I want... I want to spend... I want
to spend the rest of my life with you.

1624
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,840
You know, I thought our worst problem
was gonna be parking.

1625
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,880
Carla Tate, will you marry me?

1626
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:12,160
Did he say marry her?

1627
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,480
- Just call up...
- Winnie, not right now!

1628
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,840
Yes, I will, Daniel McMahon.

1629
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:32,760
Daniel, stand right here.

1630
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,040
- Okay.
- And a little bit quiet.

1631
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:39,800
<i>- Just be quiet.
- This is good. It's like Where's Waldo?</i>

1632
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:44,440
E- Excuse me, um... Mother,
could you say something, please?

1633
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,200
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm...
I'm so terribly sorry...

1634
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:51,320
for this slight inconvenience, but
you know how children will be sometimes.

1635
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,760
In any event, I think we should proceed
with our very lovely ceremony...

1636
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,160
and Carla will retire
as a bridesmaid...

1637
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:02,760
and she will come and join us with
Daniel, and we will finalize these vows.

1638
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,920
- Well done.
- Thank you. You have been fabulous!

1639
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,360
Love is in the air.

1640
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:35,440
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, as
best man of these festivities...</i>

1641
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:39,240
<i>it is my one duty of the evening
to make a toast.</i>

1642
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:41,240
<i>To the bride and groom!</i>

1643
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,920
Go along. It's all right.
Have a good time, all right?

1644
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,200
- Elizabeth, it should have been filmed for a TV special.
- Hi!

1645
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:35,080
- And that boy jumping off the balcony!
- Oh, wasn't that... Well, well, we didn't exactly plan that.

1646
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,800
- We're gonna be calling you Granny soon.
- Well, I hope so. Oh, what's the matter?

1647
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,200
She broke her shoe.
I can't take her anywhere.

1648
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:40,440
It's all right.

1649
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,400
- Mom?
- Yes?

1650
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,560
- Is it time to plan another wedding?
- Radley!

1651
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,800
- Uh, I don't think you need...
- I know that you don't like Daniel now...

1652
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,080
but in time...

1653
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:58,320
Oh! Everything's perfect,
and your daughters are so beautiful.

1654
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:00,880
- I know they are beautiful, Mary.
- But don't you have a son?

1655
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,160
No, no.
Cousin Vivian has a son.

1656
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,680
- Oh! Thank you.
- Vivian. Yes. That's very... Okay.

1657
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:06,880
- Mom.
- What, honey?

1658
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,840
- You do like him?
- Oh, I like him. It's just I don't know if you're ready...

1659
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,480
- Hi, Radley. - Did you think so? -
You don't think I'm ready to be married?

1660
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:18,600
Oh, Carla.
Will you please listen to me?

1661
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:20,520
Please listen
to what I'm saying.

1662
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:24,160
When you think you're in love, your eyes
are closed to all logic and reason.

1663
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:29,000
- It's not the time to make a big decision.
- No, but my eyes are not closed, Mother!

1664
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,600
Dear, Carla,
we can have this discussion...

1665
01:47:31,720 --> 01:47:33,920
without you getting upset
in front of everybody, Carla.

1666
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:37,600
- My eyes are not closed, Mother!
- Please, Carla.

1667
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:41,120
- Carla!
- Is everything all right?

1668
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,640
Just... Oh! Wh...
Are you all right?

1669
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:46,080
No, it's fine.

1670
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:51,360
Carla, wait a minute! Wait!

1671
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,760
Carla! Wait!

1672
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:56,200
My God, this looks bad.
I better go tell the girls.

1673
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:59,000
Carla, stop it! Stop! Carla!

1674
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,400
Oh, my God.

1675
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:04,520
Carla, just wait a second.
I just want you to understand!

1676
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:06,560
- Carla, listen to me. Listen.
- What? What?

1677
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:10,160
It's not that I don't like Danny. It has
nothing to do with whether I like Danny or not!

1678
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,080
- Yes, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

1679
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:15,360
- What's wrong with him, Mother?
- Nothing is wrong with him, Carla.

1680
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:19,880
He's fine. He's perfectly fine.
I'm just asking for you to wait.

1681
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,280
Danny's the first boy you've met,
and I think you can do better!

1682
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:27,360
No, but I can't do better
because I'm not better.

1683
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:30,280
- You're better. You're better.
- Stop touching me!

1684
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,480
- You're better!
- I'm not a baby!

1685
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,440
No, I'm not better.

1686
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,160
I'm just me, Mom.
Can't you see me?

1687
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:42,040
- I just...
- You never look at me!

1688
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,440
And no matter
how long I wait...

1689
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,240
I can't be a painter,
and I can't play tennis.

1690
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,840
- And I'm not an artist.
- Okay, but I...

1691
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,720
But I know how to do some things.

1692
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,960
- Yes. Yes.
- And I can love.

1693
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:04,000
And I love Daniel,
and he loves me very much.

1694
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:06,960
I know he does,
but, Carla, I just...

1695
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:09,120
don't think that
he can take care of you!

1696
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:12,120
He can barely take care
of himself.

1697
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,720
We can take care
of each other!

1698
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,040
We don't need you, Mother!

1699
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:20,720
But don't worry.
You don't have to come to my wedding.

1700
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:25,040
I'll do my own wedding. I hated
everything you did for Caroline's wedding.

1701
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,120
Okay.

1702
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:30,000
I hated the dumb hats
and these dumb shoes...

1703
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:32,840
and your big, ugly centrepieces.

1704
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,840
The only thing I like is this dress.

1705
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,760
- This is pretty.
- Okay.

1706
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:41,200
I'm gonna keep it.

1707
01:49:41,320 --> 01:49:45,040
- Oh, my God! Come back inside, dear, please.
- No!

1708
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:47,640
- I'm gonna do my wedding all by myself.
- Please, Carla.

1709
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:51,440
And if you don't like Daniel,
I don't care. Don't come.

1710
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:54,280
Because Daniel
will be there for sure.

1711
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:57,360
- I'm going home, Mother.
- Carla, come back!

1712
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,880
- No!
- Please!

1713
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,080
Ohh! Oh, C...

1714
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,880
But, Carla... Carla!

1715
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:17,880
Y- Your mom's not gonna
help throw our wedding?

1716
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,840
- No.
- Are you sure?

1717
01:50:19,960 --> 01:50:23,240
'Cause she... she throws
a really nice wedding.

1718
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,760
Yes, I'm very sure.

1719
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:29,640
She's not planning the wedding
because we are.

1720
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,360
Ow! Oh, you almost got me.

1721
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:41,400
<i>- Please come to our wedding on February 14 at St Francis Church.
- Heather?</i>

1722
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,520
Guess what. Carla's
getting married this weekend.

1723
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:50,240
<i>The bridesmaids are going to be you,
Heather and Rachel from school.</i>

1724
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:52,480
Yes, you plan it.
I will chip in.

1725
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:55,920
<i>And some other school friends
are coming too.</i>

1726
01:50:56,040 --> 01:51:00,200
Oh, tell Carla I said thank you
so much for including Michelle.

1727
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,120
<i>But be on time.</i>

1728
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:05,520
<i>Daniel made a special
arrangement with the church...</i>

1729
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:08,360
<i>and we're going to be married...</i>

1730
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:11,640
<i>in between another wedding
and a funeral.</i>

1731
01:51:15,560 --> 01:51:19,360
- It's almost time.
- Uh, yes. Yes, Winnie.

1732
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,240
- There's your suit, Dr Tate. - Thank
you. Thank you. - It's been pressed.

1733
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,320
- See you at the church.
- Yes.

1734
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:26,440
Where were you this morning?

1735
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:32,040
Carla asked me to talk to Danny
about responsibilities, about bravery.

1736
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:36,880
- I'm going to that wedding, Elizabeth.
- Mm-hmm.

1737
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,120
I'm gonna go
to that wedding.

1738
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:42,960
Carla refuses to let me pay for
the wedding, but she does want me...

1739
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:47,080
to walk her down the aisle,
and I'm gonna walk her down the aisle.

1740
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,240
When you reach a certain age and
you're not talking to your children...

1741
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:59,440
I think you're missing
a very important part of the journey.

1742
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,240
You better get going.
You're going to be late.

1743
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:45,840
- Hi!
- Watch your step.

1744
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,600
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

1745
01:52:56,720 --> 01:53:00,440
I'm so proud of you.
I love you.

1746
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,280
That's the mother,
the boyfriend...

1747
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,680
and the baker, Danny's boss.

1748
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,280
That's the housekeeper
and the son-in-law.

1749
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:17,440
<i>At last</i>

1762
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:59,840

w- when we didn't make it up yet.

1764

And we came up with our own vows now,
at the last minute.

1765
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,520
Okay... Okay, you... We... We say our vows,
and then you say your vows.

But we'll still pay you

Okay. Carla Tate?

I love you very much...

1770

and I wanna make you happy.

1771
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:37,600
And, uh, I, I take you
as my wife...

1772

1773
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:48,200
And then it... it's my turn.

That's all right.
Just try it again.

That doesn't matter.
It... It doesn't matter.

1781
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:19,760
I just wanted to say...

1782
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:23,760
that I love you very much...

1783
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:26,840
and I wanted
to let everybody know...

1784

That's all.

1787
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,440
Oh, uh, uh... Just wait... One... One
moment. We have to do the rings. The rings.

1788
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:45,440
- Danny.
- Now, please take this ring.

1789
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:48,880
Okay, w-with this ring,
I give you my love...

1790
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,880
and... and I...
my promise and my, my joy...

1791
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,920
that for wherever you are,
I will always love you.

1792
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,160
I feel exactly the same way.

1793
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:04,360
Oh, wait. Just one more.
I'm sorry. One more moment.

1794
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:08,200
And now, by the power
vested in me...

1795
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,440
Here it comes.

1796
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:13,360
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1797
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:17,360
Go in peace.

1798
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:20,120
Now you may do it.

1799
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:22,680
Now you can kiss your bride.
