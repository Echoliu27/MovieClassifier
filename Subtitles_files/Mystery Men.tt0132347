1
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,556
Would you like
something sweet?

2
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,743
What do we got here, fellas,
an antique show?

3
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,545
All right, boys, fan out!

4
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,912
What a wrinkle fest this is.

5
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,150
Hey, beat it, you broads!
Come on!

6
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,621
All right, sit down
and shut up!

7
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,461
We're the Red Eyes.
So, everybody, freeze!

8
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,998
Get their valuables, boys. I
want watches, wallets, jewelry.

9
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,526
Get me some silver chains.
I want wigs. I want toupees.

10
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,964
Keep an eye out
for me, will ya?

11
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,211
No, not mine! Leave me alone!
I'm a veteran!

12
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,204
No! Not that!

13
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,344
I love crashing parties!

14
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,855
Hey, cake!

15
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,285
Pardon me, Fatty.

16
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:46,356
But if you're going to eat
cake, you ought to use a fork.

17
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,959
You might just as well
shovel it in.

18
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,176
People who don't close
their mouths when they chew

19
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,509
make me furious.

20
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,280
One for you. Drat.

21
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,083
And for you!

22
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,863
Come on, come on.

23
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,794
Want a little whipped cream,
Mr. Cherry Top?

24
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,030
Get him, get him.

25
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,609
Is that all you got, huh?
Is that all you...

26
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,549
Throw it!

27
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,916
Not today,
my vermilion-eyed varlet.

28
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,355
Oh, blast.

29
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,915
Out of the way!

30
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,203
Yes, this one should stick.

31
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,035
Oh, my! That's way
too tight, man!

32
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,289
It's Captain Amazing!

33
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,768
It's Amazing! I'm out of here!

34
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,320
C.A., you were,
if I may say, amazing.

35
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,629
Yeah?
Yeah.

36
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,530
Let's go meet the press.

37
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,096
He is good.

38
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,402
He is rather ripping,
isn't he?

39
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,929
The spinning and the hurting
and the kicking.

40
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,836
I guarantee you he hogs
the credit on this one.

41
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,043
Well, I think we have to

42
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,536
at least concede him
the assist here, Roy.

43
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,982
No, no. You see? That's
exactly what's holding us back.

44
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,985
Don't put him on the pedestal,
put us on the pedestal.

45
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,579
Here he comes.

46
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,958
Bravo and huzzah, Captain.
Splendid work, as usual.

47
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,727
No autographs till
we finish with the press.

48
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,463
We're not...
Allow me to introduce myself.

49
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,465
Blue Raja,
master of silverware,

50
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,401
forks a specialty,
at your service.

51
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,869
My colleague, the Shoveler.

52
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,270
Big fan of your work.

53
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,907
And standing rather painfully
aside is our cohort, Mr. Furious.

54
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,042
How's it hanging?

55
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,169
So you guys...

56
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,071
They're superheroes.

57
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,083
We fight crime. Call it
what you will. Quite right.

58
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,553
That's great. Just, you know,

59
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,788
keep up the good work.

60
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,722
You as well, sir. You as well.

61
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,864
Did you see... Did you...

62
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,459
Did you hear that?
"Keep up the good work. "

63
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,667
The good work.

64
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,802
He's making fun of us.

65
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,538
No, Roy. He saluted us. That was real.

66
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,573
I thought he was sincere.
What's up, fellas?

67
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,508
Hello.
Nice to see you.

68
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,012
I saw the action
out there tonight.

69
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,313
What you guys need is
a little bit of firepower.

70
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,650
Well...

71
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,380
I'm a weapons designer.

72
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,121
I've got what you need.

73
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,590
All right.
We'll come back.

74
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,294
We'll visit all of you
people later. Thank you, sir.

75
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,492
I don't live here.
I'm here for the ladies.

76
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,559
Here, take my card.

77
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,397
My name's Heller.
Say it with me.

78
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,274
Heller.
Heller.

79
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,800
All right. Thank you.

80
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,746
Goodnight.

81
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,514
I don't know why you encourage
those people.

82
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,449
Those people look up to us.

83
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,112
Oh, that's true.

84
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,420
You know the drill.

85
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,480
Please sign my hat,
Captain Amazing.

86
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,952
Herman, give me a flash.

87
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,761
Hey, how are you tonight?

88
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,730
Captain, how did you know
where to find the Red Eyes?

89
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,566
Becky, it's what I do.

90
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,568
Thanks to you,
the city's almost crime-free.

91
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,868
So what do you do
with your free time?

92
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,140
I wish that I had
some free time.

93
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,810
People are saying that you're so "amazing"
you're gonna put yourself out of a job.

94
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,211
Have any comments on that?

95
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,681
That's one problem
I look forward to.

96
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:32,379
And is it true that you lost
your Pepsi endorsement?

97
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,051
I hadn't heard that.

98
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,457
Thanks so much for your questions.
Thank all of you so much.

99
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,292
You sure, you have no comments
regarding your Pepsi situation?

100
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,771
Look who we got.

101
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,332
You again. Wannabes.

102
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,177
This city already
has a superhero.

103
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,013
Perhaps you've heard of him.
Captain Amazing.

104
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,243
Thank you.

105
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,851
Do yourself a favor, Maguire.

106
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,886
Don't flip my switch tonight.

107
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:12,382
And what exactly
would that do?

108
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,095
Don't turn around, Roy. Don't
do it. Don't turn around.

109
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,497
It's nothing. Keep walking, Roy.
Keep walking.

110
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,466
It's not worth it.

111
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:27,606
I think you know exactly what
that would do, checkerhead.

112
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,606
What?

113
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,476
Don't mess with
the volcano, my man.

114
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,511
'Cause I will go Pompeii
on your butt.

115
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,822
Oh, my golly.
Good grief.

116
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,529
You keep dreaming, wannabe.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,163
Let's go.
Dream on, moron.

118
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,633
I will keep dreaming. I will
keep dreaming, my friend.

119
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,533
And when I wake up,
you better hope,

120
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,678
you better hope you're asleep.

121
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,048
Don't reengage him.
He's a silly...

122
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,215
Sweet dreams!

123
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,316
He's immature.

124
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,444
Lilac.

125
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,023
C.A., I'm doing my best.

126
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,894
Your best? Quick question:
Is this your best?

127
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,930
I realize you're upset.

128
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,598
Victor, I'm positioned.

129
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:31,136
Do you understand what that means?
On a very personal level here,

130
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,906
to know that the companies
that make these fine products

131
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,899
want me to be their
spokesperson? Their voice?

132
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,079
I think right now we should
focus on the positive.

133
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,775
Tonight was good.

134
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,681
Yeah? You think so?

135
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:48,477
'Cause I was worried it was,
I don't know, pathetic!

136
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,389
"Amazing triumphs
at a nursing home!"

137
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,051
That's great copy, Vic.

138
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,250
I'm a publicist,
not a magician.

139
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,562
You want big news,
you have to have big fights.

140
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,522
A superhero needs a supervillain and,
thanks to you, we've got none left.

141
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,203
Then get the Death Man.

142
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,364
Death Man is dead.

143
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,239
Okay. Father Doom.

144
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,571
Life without parole.

145
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,944
Apocalypta's doing 50 years.
Armagezzmo's in exile.

146
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,745
Baron Von Chaos got the chair.

147
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,847
Really?

148
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,249
Casanova Frankenstein
is locked up in a nuthouse.

149
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,048
Casanova Frankenstein.

150
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,987
Now, there was a supervillain.

151
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,924
You know, he just...

152
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,660
He's got those eyes, you know?

153
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,024
I can't do it, but...

154
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,164
And that voice...
Such pure evil.

155
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,967
The battles we used to have.
Extraordinary.

156
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,299
"Used to. "

157
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,765
That's the problem,
Captain. "Used to. "

158
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,041
Let the record show

159
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,410
that this parole hearing
has officially begun.

160
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:40,058
We now commence the 17th parole
hearing of Casanova Frankenstein.

161
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,699
Dr. Leek, you may begin.

162
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,162
Thank you.

163
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,108
Gentlemen of the board,
the man who sits before you,

164
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,774
the once infamous evil genius,
is entirely cured.

165
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,180
What?

166
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,282
I give you my word

167
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,550
that he's of no more danger
to the city than I am.

168
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,355
This is outrageous.

169
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,721
Yes.

170
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,222
Mr. Casanova
Frankenstein,

171
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,052
do you have anything to say
on your own behalf?

172
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:15,659
Blessed disciples
of Hippocrates,

173
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,571
my heart is split in two.

174
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,306
It brims

175
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,871
with such sorrow
for my abominable crimes.

176
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,812
And yet,

177
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,086
it swells with love

178
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,115
for you,

179
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,992
for this sanctuary,

180
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,860
this place of healing.

181
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,696
Within my soul,
I feel the choir singing

182
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,133
Beethoven's immortal
Ode to Joy

183
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,197
where all men

184
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,410
become brothers.

185
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,147
Am I too late to cast my vote?

186
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:09,120
Not at all, Lance. I was
just about to remind the board

187
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,725
that Casanova once had our city
in a stranglehold of terror.

188
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:18,323
Parole is not an option
for this man, this monster.

189
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,932
We cannot risk
the danger of releasing him.

190
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,535
I could not agree
with you more.

191
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,526
Excellent.

192
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:30,409
However, I did just have dinner
with an old friend recently.

193
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,378
Maybe you've heard of him?
Captain Amazing.

194
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,579
Captain Amazing?

195
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,210
He asked if I would read this.

196
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,088
"Dear members of the board,

197
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,557
"we all know that society
cannot exist

198
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,754
"without absolute justice,

199
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:53,896
"but society is also
built upon compassion.

200
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,269
"Let us set the tone
for the new millennium

201
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,771
"by making a historic
gesture of forgiveness.

202
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,298
"Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you,

203
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,636
"let us grant
Casanova Frankenstein

204
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,715
"a second chance. "

205
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:17,182
With Captain Amazing's
recommendation and protection,

206
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:21,252
I suppose we could consider.

207
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,419
I pronounce you

208
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,762
cured.

209
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,937
Hello, Champion City.

210
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,514
Daddy is home.

211
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,033
Hi, everybody.

212
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,703
You know, tooth decay
and gingivitis can be a crime.

213
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,139
That's why I use
Mighty Whity toothpaste.

214
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:11,102
Because I want my teeth
to look amazing.

215
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,813
I'm gonna bring this up again.

216
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,048
It's 150 bucks apiece.
We each chip in.

217
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,484
My cousin knows this guy who
knows a publicist.

218
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,355
What are we gonna publicize? The fact
that we get our butts kicked a lot.

219
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,291
Maybe if you didn't smack me in the face
with the shovel every time we went out...

220
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,360
All right now. ... we'd have
some more wins to brag about.

221
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,229
I'm sorry, I just have a
tendency to lose my concentration

222
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,398
when I've got a salad fork
stuck in my rear end.

223
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,568
I get it. Your shovel
in his face is my fault.

224
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,871
You threw a spoon
at the guy, Jeff.

225
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,072
What was up with that?

226
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,207
I'm embarrassed about that.

227
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,308
I thought it was a fork.

228
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,409
You're the master of cutlery.

229
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,746
You can't throw a knife sometimes
when someone's trying to kill me?

230
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,614
You can't use
a rake sometimes?

231
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,715
No, I'm the Shoveler.

232
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,084
I'm the Blue Raja.
I'm not Stab Man.

233
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,121
I'm not Knifey Boy.
I'm the Blue Raja.

234
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,189
That's another thing.

235
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,290
What?

236
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,659
You could get a little bit of
blue in the uniform somewhere.

237
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,296
You've got green. There's
a little flowery thing.

238
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,165
It doesn't make
a lot of sense.

239
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,965
Just step out of our
literal minds for a moment.

240
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,771
Hey, look what I'm doing.
Look at that.

241
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,073
I'm putting 150 right on
the table. Who's in with me?

242
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,209
I don't have 150, do I?

243
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,845
If I did, I wouldn't have
plundered my mother's silverware.

244
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,046
It's a waste of money.

245
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,846
You know who doesn't think
it's a waste of money?

246
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,350
Little Mr. Captain Amazing.

247
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,451
Well, Captain...

248
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,221
If we had a billionaire like
Lance Hunt as our benefactor,

249
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,189
yeah, we could spend 150.

250
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,058
Lance Hunt is Captain Amazing.

251
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,892
Don't start that again.

252
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,599
Lance Hunt wears glasses. Captain
Amazing doesn't wear glasses.

253
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,601
He takes them off
when he transforms.

254
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:46,004
That doesn't make any sense.
He wouldn't be able to see.

255
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,076
Hi, thanks for waiting.

256
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,909
Hey, thanks for dropping by.

257
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,013
Do you know what you want?

258
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,015
Allow me to begin, my dear.

259
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,384
The Blue Raja is quite partial
to the salad ni9oise.

260
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,987
My dressing of choice
is ranch lite,

261
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:05,048
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd hold the Bacon Bits.

262
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,860
Seeing as it's your first night and
all, I suppose I'll "fork-give" you

263
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,996
if you "fork-get. "

264
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,331
Who's next?

265
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,301
Can I get a meatball sandwich
on white with mayo?

266
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:19,371
I'll have a steak, please. Very
rare. That means pink, not bloody.

267
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,006
And could I get some ice?

268
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:24,109
I had a little mishap defending
justice at the nursing home.

269
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,909
I thought I heard on TV
that was Captain Amazing.

270
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,883
Let's all be good little automaton droids
and believe everything we hear on TV.

271
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:39,119
I'll just go place
your order now.

272
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,396
A trifle strident with that bit
of crumpet, weren't we, Furious?

273
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,127
I am a ticking
time bomb of fury.

274
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,669
All I'm saying is, when we
split the check three ways,

275
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,338
the steak-eater picks
the pocket of the salad man.

276
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,973
Just give me the money, Jeff.

277
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,241
Yes, fine.

278
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,710
Every time we split it
three ways.

279
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,701
It's flipping robbery.

280
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,381
Well, you should order more.

281
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,211
Do you see what I see?

282
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,721
Hello?

283
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,989
It's Tony C.

284
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,517
And Tony P,
leader of the Disco Boys.

285
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,297
But why, pray tell,
would he be back in town?

286
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,377
Maybe it's time to do a
little following to find out.

287
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,176
No,
it's already 10:30.

288
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,481
I'm gonna get killed
by my wife as it is.

289
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,146
Yes, and I've had quite enough
excitement for one night, thank you.

290
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,522
My mistake. I thought I was hanging
out with serious superheroes:

291
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,157
The Shoveler
and the Blue Raja.

292
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:50,261
But, apparently, I'm hanging
out with Lazy Boy and...

293
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,363
Good night, Roy.

294
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,464
Yes, toodle-oo.

295
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,797
Hang on a second.
Lazy Boy and the...

296
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,169
And the Recliner!

297
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,265
Yeah, Lazy Boy
and the Recliner!

298
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,806
Guys, are you coming?
Are you...

299
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,549
Okay, fine. I guess tonight

300
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,685
the lone wolf

301
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,348
hunts alone.

302
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,831
Testicles rising.

303
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,327
Can't breathe. Can't breathe.

304
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,512
Butch needs his vest back.
He's got a game on Saturday.

305
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,584
Well, it's my vest too.
I bought it for him.

306
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,213
The only thing I need...

307
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,655
Okay.

308
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,249
How long you gonna
do this, Eddie?

309
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,159
It's been 12 years.

310
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,150
I know.

311
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,797
You got a family
to look after, Eddie.

312
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,491
The kids are worried sick
about you.

313
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,796
But still you go out, night after
night, running around the city for what?

314
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,032
Lucille, God gave me a gift.

315
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,779
I shovel well.
I shovel very well.

316
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,984
Oh, baby, you shovel better
than any man I've known

317
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,720
but that does not make you
a superhero.

318
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:56,988
All I...

319
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:57,979
Oh, no.

320
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,126
You're a good husband

321
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,459
and a good father,

322
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,960
but that's all, nothing more.

323
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,435
You're right.

324
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,102
I believe in you, Daddy.

325
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,102
Roland, do not
encourage your father.

326
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,720
Well, if it isn't
our old friends, the Red Eyes.

327
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:32,282
Good evening. We weren't expecting
to see you again so spoon...

328
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:39,696
Red Eyes, Red Eyes.
What a treat.

329
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:43,766
We weren't expecting to
see you again so spoon.

330
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,571
Jeffrey.
Yeah?

331
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:49,974
Mom, how many times have I
asked you not to barge in here?

332
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,976
What's burning?

333
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,077
Incense.

334
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,680
I can't even count how many
rules you're breaking right now.

335
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,783
One: Always knock. Two: Don't
sniff around outside my door.

336
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,019
Three: Do not interrogate me.

337
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,120
Jeffrey.

338
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,179
What?

339
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,117
Are you into marijuana?

340
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,293
You're cheesing me off
so bad right now.

341
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,861
Just, please... Good night.

342
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,096
I'm sorry.
Jeffrey, please...

343
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,164
Goodnight.

344
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,223
Okay. Goodnight.

345
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,137
God, she's just so...

346
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,336
All right, let's see
what's shaking

347
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,943
at the Chez Casa Casanova.

348
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:53,760
Ah! The old disco room.

349
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:01,806
Just as I left it.

350
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:06,472
You've been locked up for 20 years. A
lot of things have changed since then.

351
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:12,042
It must have been hard for you, the
way times and styles have changed,

352
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,854
to hear the people saying
that disco is dead.

353
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,882
Disco is not dead!
Disco is life!

354
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,561
Yes, Tony, that is the passion
I remember.

355
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,037
Stick with me, Tony,
and you will dance again

356
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:35,030
when I rule this town.

357
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,048
Have you met
my psychiatrist?

358
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,353
Come out, come out
wherever you...

359
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,288
There we go.

360
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,590
Looks like we got
a little terrace party.

361
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,822
I want you to spread
the word to all of my gangs.

362
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,794
Tell them that
Casanova Frankenstein is back

363
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,368
and that Casanova Frankenstein
is planning something

364
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,360
a little bit different.

365
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,073
Kaboom.

366
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,206
Mama pajama!

367
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,355
What kind of crazy man
blows up a crazy house?

368
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,759
And now, if you will excuse
me, I am expecting a visit

369
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,819
from a very old friend.

370
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:43,904
Look what we got. A little
booty call from Captain Amazing.

371
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:52,181
This is a fine,
elegant Harvey Wallbanger.

372
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,951
Even when it's sucked
by scum like you?

373
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,017
Captain Amazing.
What a surprise.

374
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,927
Really? I'm not
so sure about that.

375
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,666
Your first night of freedom,
and you blow up the asylum.

376
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,500
Interesting choice.
I knew you couldn't change.

377
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,937
I knew you'd know that.

378
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,072
Oh, I know that.

379
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,803
And I knew you'd know
I'd know you knew.

380
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:21,206
But I didn't. I only knew
that you'd know that I knew.

381
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,177
Did you know that?

382
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,718
Of course.

383
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,278
Please, won't you join me?

384
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,578
With pleasure.

385
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,890
Oh, quick thought.

386
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,860
Would you mind removing
the submicronic laser

387
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,463
in the ring on the index
finger of your left hand?

388
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,032
Of course. And, if it
wouldn't be too much trouble,

389
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,034
go ahead and disengage

390
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:47,004
the psychotropic bacterium
dart-launchers in your slippers.

391
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,539
Done.

392
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,611
The cold fusion ultrasonic neuro-stunner
in your drink stirrer, turn it off.

393
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,673
We know each other so well,
don't we, Lance?

394
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,944
We've always been each other's
greatest nemesises.

395
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,614
Nemesis...

396
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,453
What's the plural on that?

397
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,988
Nemeses.

398
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:09,718
Whatever.

399
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,830
You're going to prison
for life this time, Casanova.

400
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,365
You see, here in
Champion City,

401
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,233
we still do
a fairly brisk trade

402
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,537
in justice.

403
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:23,497
I thought it was all about the publicity
and keeping your sponsors happy.

404
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,144
See, it's that kind
of cynicism that I truly feel

405
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,846
is starting to poison society.

406
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,781
Oh, looky here.

407
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,051
A multi-frequency
radio detonator.

408
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,188
You should be more careful when
discarding incriminating evidence.

409
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,725
Oh, no. This is
an amusing little gizmo.

410
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,694
It's really quite cool.

411
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,895
Yeah? What is it?

412
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,292
Yuck.

413
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:54,836
It's a chloroform-deploying
portable enticement snare.

414
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,501
Ah, dang!

415
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,813
Oh, Lancie,

416
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,252
you really are so predictable.

417
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,701
Morning, Sally.

418
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,802
You're late!

419
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,170
Yes, I know.

420
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,739
I was up all night, trying
to defend the city from evil,

421
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,741
but I'm sure you don't
really care about that.

422
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,078
Work starts at 0:00!
It's 0:25!

423
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,480
So I guess all the junk's
probably ruined by now.

424
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,951
Sucker, when are you gonna tear
down that jeep like I told you to?

425
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,953
I thought we went
through this yesterday.

426
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:45,723
That old jeep is actually
an armored car of some type.

427
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,192
It was meant to withstand bombs. I
can't just rip it apart with a crowbar.

428
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,025
Just junk it.

429
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,730
If you gave me
the proper tools, I could...

430
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,721
Junk it!

431
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,735
I'm willing to have
this discussion with you,

432
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,297
but I think we should deal with
it like two people who respect...

433
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,809
I want it junked.

434
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,811
Okay.

435
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:09,212
Right now, I'm kind of like
a powder keg

436
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,716
and you're the match.

437
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,251
If you tell me to
junk it one more time...

438
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,620
Junk it now! You got that?

439
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,274
That little sucker
just saved your life.

440
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,812
Just junk it,
you miserable cuss.

441
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,269
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

442
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,104
Champion City's best-known billionaire,
Lance Hunt, has disappeared.

443
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:12,543
Police hope to enlist the help of
Captain Amazing in the search for Hunt,

444
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,845
but have, so far, failed to contact
the city's beloved superhero.

445
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,349
He makes a wonderful trophy,
don't you think?

446
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,858
I really think we need
to talk about your plans here.

447
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,226
Here are my plans, Lancie.

448
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:34,532
Tomorrow night,
I'm going to kill you.

449
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,301
Right. That's the part that
really doesn't work for me.

450
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:42,331
When the clock strikes 12:00,
cuckoo, cuckoo,

451
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,974
you will be dead,

452
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,503
and my city will be given
a new state of mind.

453
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,780
Clearly you gotta go with
what you're comfortable with,

454
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,583
but, I don't know, I just
keep coming back to this place.

455
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,752
I'm spitballing here,
but maybe

456
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:59,423
we release the captain
to the authorities.

457
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,026
I say that you're completely
reformed. Wink, wink.

458
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,028
There is rejoicing
in the streets.

459
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:08,532
At that point, you do the whole
destruction of the city thing.

460
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,402
I mean, is it
a perfect plan? No.

461
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,305
And I think that's what
I like about it.

462
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,842
Jeez. Okay.

463
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,446
That's great.
Turn off the lights now.

464
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,882
It was just an idea!
Wait, I got a better one.

465
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,285
You let me live,
I am your sidekick.

466
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:32,553
I'm like Amazing Boy
or... Casanova?

467
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,559
Are you sure
Captain Amazing is in there?

468
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,654
Yeah, I'm sure.
Let's go.

469
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,065
Wait! Hear that?

470
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,636
We must have hit
a trip wire.

471
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:22,606
It could be a photon
eviscerator heating up.

472
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,010
It could be a cybernetic atom
scrambler. They target moving objects.

473
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,979
Sounds more like a heat-seeking
anthrax projection gun to me.

474
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,848
Quickly, cover your
mouth. No, let's bolt!

475
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,883
Don't move! Don't breathe!
Let's bolt!

476
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,185
Don't move! Don't breathe!

477
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,319
Let's bolt!

478
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,356
It's the sprinkler.

479
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:46,330
Isn't that just fabu?
I'm positively soaked.

480
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,137
What do we got here?

481
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,403
I think they're supposed to be
jive superheroes.

482
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,940
They made a big mistake
coming to Casanova's place.

483
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:05,916
What's so funny?

484
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,546
That's your power?
You have guns?

485
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,121
Couldn't you be a little more
creative than that?

486
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,057
Do forgive the impertinence,

487
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,060
but what the devil does a
pistol have to do with disco?

488
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,161
Weak.

489
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,254
At best.

490
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,658
Check out the guy with the
pipe. Are you the disco plumber?

491
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,636
There's no theme
at all here, mates.

492
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:29,073
Buddy, if you're gonna carry
a chain, make it a gold chain.

493
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,775
See what I'm saying? And that's
just off the top of my head.

494
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,377
Yo, what's up, Tiger Lily?

495
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,176
The top of your head, huh?

496
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,155
We'll never get in there.
There are too many Disco Boys.

497
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,259
Look, I'm telling you. Amazing's
in there. I saw him go in.

498
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,561
There's never any evil trios,
are there?

499
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:54,226
No, they've all got to travel
in gangs like little babies.

500
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,668
Maybe it's time
to level the playing field.

501
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:58,659
How?

502
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,206
I'm talking about recruiting.

503
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,075
There's plenty of guys out there who
would kill to get in on our action.

504
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,144
Plenty of posers,
you mean.

505
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,512
Yeah, maybe a few.

506
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,415
But there's got to be a
couple of guys out there, like,

507
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,350
like a human torch.

508
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:17,521
Or like a guy who can shoot
stinging foam into your eyes

509
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,252
or something like that.

510
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,960
There's the Sphinx,
of course.

511
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,061
The what?

512
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,362
The Sphinx.

513
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,530
I know this guy.

514
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:30,000
Big crime fighter from down south.
Big-league hitter down there.

515
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,435
What's his power?

516
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,836
He's terribly mysterious.

517
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,539
That's it? That's his power?

518
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,041
He's mysterious?

519
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,076
Terribly mysterious.

520
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,738
Plus, he can, like,

521
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,814
cut guns in half
with his mind.

522
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,910
Really? I hadn't heard that. I think.

523
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,986
We'll have to track
this Sphinx guy down.

524
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:52,616
Meantime, I have an idea
where we can get another guy.

525
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,225
I'm free for lunch tomorrow.
How about you?

526
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,928
Nothing I couldn't
move around.

527
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,309
Why don't you guys
go on ahead?

528
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,177
I gotta take care
of something.

529
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,508
Oh, I see.

530
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,151
Good cause there,
saving homeless animals.

531
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,860
Yeah.

532
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,264
Hog queen?

533
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,334
What?

534
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,666
You're into motorcycles.

535
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,966
Oh. No. Not really.

536
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,403
'Cause I got a motorcycle.

537
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,311
Yeah, what kind?

538
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,579
It's a Harley.

539
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,638
A Harley.

540
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:54,952
Compatible. It's a Harley compatible.
Basically, the same engineer.

541
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,521
Look,

542
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,355
I hope we're cool
about last night.

543
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,359
Last night?

544
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,058
Like I said, I was kind of
in scary mode back there.

545
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:10,059
Sometimes that comes off as a
little threatening or whatever.

546
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,935
I don't find you threatening.

547
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,406
You're very kind.

548
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,704
At all.

549
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,710
Listen, I still feel like

550
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:23,113
I should make it up to you
somehow, just in some way.

551
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:27,317
I should take you out to dinner or
something to make up for being so scary,

552
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,419
or whatever.

553
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,717
I'm really busy.

554
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,292
Right.

555
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,631
Our little chess game
continues.

556
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,467
Yeah?

557
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,836
We're looking for the one
they call "The Invisible Boy. "

558
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,274
All my life,
I've been ignored by people.

559
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,843
Finally, after years
of being overlooked,

560
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:56,212
I found I have
the power to disappear.

561
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,749
It's real ironic how
it happened 'cause...

562
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,740
Can we come in?

563
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,286
Yeah, sure. Come on.

564
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:03,387
Thank you.

565
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,619
Dad, I'm going to my room
with three strange men.

566
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,227
And that's pretty much it.

567
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,030
So, let me get this straight.

568
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:15,693
You do have the ability
to become invisible?

569
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,434
Yes.

570
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,403
But you can't give us
a demonstration?

571
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,466
No, I can only become invisible
when no one's watching.

572
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:27,377
So, you're only invisible
to yourself?

573
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,816
No. If I look at myself,
I become visible again.

574
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:38,379
So, you can only become invisible
when absolutely nobody is watching you?

575
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,825
Yes.

576
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,453
Do forgive our incredulity,

577
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:48,257
but I'm wondering how you can be certain
you've achieved transparency at all?

578
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:54,194
When you go invisible,
you can feel it.

579
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:57,908
I'm leaving.

580
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,276
Thanks a lot.
It was nice to have met you.

581
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,479
Wait, guys. Don't go. Where
you guys going? Don't go.

582
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,449
Can I come?

583
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,618
Look, no offense, kid,

584
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,387
we're about to go up against
a really powerful supervillain,

585
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,523
Casanova Frankenstein.

586
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:15,325
That means we gotta find a lot
of superheroes really quickly.

587
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,794
And to tell you the truth, we have
no idea where to even start, so...

588
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,593
I know tons of superheroes.

589
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:21,799
I'm sure
you know a lot...

590
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,900
No, no, no, seriously.

591
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:26,170
I'm out there all the time at the
costume shops, martial arts stores

592
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,238
talking to guys
and making connections.

593
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,765
If you want to break in,
you gotta network,

594
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,844
and I know how to network.

595
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,142
Sorry, kid.

596
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,875
Come on.

597
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:39,375
Haven't you guys
ever been a kid?

598
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:43,051
Haven't you guys
ever had a dream?

599
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,731
Let me see, who else have
I met? There's the Pincher.

600
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:55,799
"Pincher. "

601
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,900
The Pickler.

602
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,368
Princess Headbutt.

603
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,470
White Flight and the Black
Menace. They work together.

604
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,962
Slow down, slow down.

605
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,707
Then there's,
Professor Pink Belly,

606
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,243
and Lucky Pierre
and The French Tickler.

607
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,276
"French Tickler. "

608
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,915
You've got all
their telephone numbers?

609
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,016
Yeah, most of them.

610
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,385
We've got to figure out a way
to get them all in one place.

611
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,854
That's quite right.

612
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,522
Some kind of a tryout.

613
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,013
Yes, a tryout.

614
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,293
Throw in a barbecue and a couple
of kegs, they'll all show up.

615
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,596
The mooch factor's pretty high
with this crowd.

616
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,588
A barbecue,
that's a good idea.

617
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:32,236
What? Bugger all, it's
the Spleen. Play dead.

618
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,303
Who's that?

619
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,102
Turn your head.
Don't say anything.

620
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,154
Hiya, fellas.

621
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,625
Word on the street is you're
looking for superheroes.

622
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:55,726
Not really.

623
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,027
Actually,
we're just leaving.

624
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,096
Rotten luck.

625
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,265
Oh, here we go.

626
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:02,399
Perfect timing.

627
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,424
That's for you.

628
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:05,936
Hamburger, right?

629
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,029
Yes, thank you.

630
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,537
Enjoy.

631
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:12,509
Why are you guys always dissing
me? It hurts my feelings.

632
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,845
I'm a superhero too.
I have powers.

633
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,247
Really? Like what?

634
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,715
So glad you asked.

635
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:19,783
Oh, no.

636
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,851
Excuse me.

637
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,615
Excuse me. Excuse me.

638
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:28,459
It all started when I
was just 13 years of age.

639
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,527
One day, while walking
with some friends,

640
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,895
I accidentally cut the cheese.

641
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:36,133
Well, in my
adolescent awkwardness,

642
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:39,661
I blamed it on an old gypsy woman
who happened to be passing by.

643
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,862
Big mistake!

644
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,375
The gypsy woman placed a curse
upon my head.

645
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,311
Because I smelled it,

646
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:51,840
she decreed I would
forevermore be he who dealt it!

647
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,750
Let me illustrate.

648
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:54,851
No,
you don't have to.

649
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,787
It's not necessary, really.

650
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,791
Let's see.

651
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:04,057
Distance: 7 meters.

652
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,857
Air speed: Normal.

653
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,723
Compensate for
air conditioning.

654
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:12,903
Pull my fingers.

655
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:13,894
Don't do it.

656
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,339
Oh, dear God.

657
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,067
S.B.D.!

658
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,120
Silent but deadly.

659
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,788
That's good shooting.

660
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,923
That was amazing!

661
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,359
It's disgusting.
Don't encourage him.

662
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,725
You guys are recruiting
for superheroes.

663
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,432
Where you holding
the tryouts?

664
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,900
We don't know yet,

665
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,734
as soon as we figure that out,
we'll get in touch immediately.

666
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:51,706
Bet we'd get a big turnout if we did
it somewhere with a swimming pool.

667
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,504
Oh, no. No, no, no.

668
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:58,407
Absolutely not. Nope. No.

669
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,056
I don't deserve this.

670
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,183
I know.

671
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,194
A lot of other men
I could have married.

672
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,496
I understand.

673
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:16,695
If one person vomits in my
pool, I'm gonna divorce you.

674
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:18,862
That's fair.

675
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,038
Come on, kids!

676
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:29,341
State your name and power.

677
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,348
I am the Waffler.

678
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:34,618
With my griddle of justice,
I bash the enemy in the head

679
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,520
or I burn them like so.

680
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,656
Don't do that.

681
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,860
I also have my truth
syrup, which is low fat.

682
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,962
And I've been working
on a theme song.

683
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,865
Waffle man,
I am the Waffler

684
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:52,234
Golden crispy,
bad guys are history

685
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,039
And I'm running.
Just think about it.

686
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,508
Do you have a health plan?
Maybe dental? Eye?

687
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,576
Next.

688
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,569
Hi. I am Pencilhead.

689
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,548
And I am
Son of Pencilhead!

690
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,917
We erase crime.

691
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,051
Two generations of...

692
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,786
Right.
Yes, thank you.

693
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:10,887
Did I do all right?

694
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,789
Yeah, I think they liked us.

695
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,850
Now, say...

696
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,254
I'm the Ballerina Man.

697
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:21,924
I don't need to see that.

698
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,366
Thanks.

699
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,342
I am...
Hey!

700
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,746
You copied me.
You copied me.

701
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,148
Did not!
Liar!

702
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,743
Ladies, now let's play nicely.

703
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,492
I'd say there's potential.

704
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:58,928
I be the Bullfighter.
I fight the bull!

705
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:02,236
Greetings, fellow crime
fighters. I am Radio Man.

706
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,174
I am Squeegeeman.

707
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,442
Do you sense its power?

708
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,543
Yes.

709
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:11,106
P.M.S. Avenger. I work 4 days a
month. Is there a problem with that?

710
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,849
No.
No.

711
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,917
Whatever you say.

712
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,085
We'll get back to you.

713
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:16,186
Quite all right.

714
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,287
Whatever.

715
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,881
Okay, that's it.

716
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:32,062
That was
a complete waste of time.

717
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,429
Like so many things we do.

718
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:40,210
Hi. Hi, you guys.
Am I too late to try out?

719
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,279
What time is it?
I don't have a watch on.

720
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,341
Yeah. Sorry. You'll have to pretend
to be a superhero somewhere else.

721
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,781
Really? I see.

722
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:51,421
That's fine.

723
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,434
Look out!

724
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,913
Look out!

725
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,492
I guess I'll just have to
take my ball and go home.

726
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,029
No. You can't go.
Miss, please.

727
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,031
Where you going?
That was cool.

728
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,728
Wait. Stop her.

729
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,502
Hold on. Stop her.
Settle down.

730
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,338
That was great.

731
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,872
We might be able to squeeze in
one more interview.

732
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,709
Yes, seeing as how you
schlepped your ball all this way.

733
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,843
Appreciate that. Thanks.

734
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,312
You're really good.

735
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,605
What's up?
I'm the Spleen.

736
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,617
I'm the Bowler.
How you doing?

737
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,245
You're very attractive.

738
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,254
That's because
it's ambrosia.

739
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,358
Why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself.

740
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,927
Help us understand why
we should choose you

741
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,062
over all the other
qualified applicants.

742
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,163
What other
qualified applicants?

743
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,860
Eddie, please.

744
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,665
Start at the top.
Where did you get your powers?

745
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,529
I got my powers
from my father.

746
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,470
Okay. Who's he?

747
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,943
Have you ever heard of
Carmine the Bowler?

748
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,311
Have we ever heard...

749
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:25,281
Cor blimey, don't tell us
you're the Bowler's daughter.

750
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,618
I seem to remember there being a
little controversy around his death.

751
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,420
That's right. The police
said it was an accident.

752
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:33,623
He'd come home late one night
and fell down an elevator shaft

753
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,191
onto some bullets.

754
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,395
I've always suspected
a bit of foul play.

755
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:40,023
As have I.

756
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:42,432
So now daddy's little girl
is all grown up,

757
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,768
looking for a little revenge,
is that it?

758
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:47,499
Yeah, that is it.
Is there a problem with that?

759
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,738
Why don't you tell me?

760
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,839
I don't know. You tell me.

761
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:56,446
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

762
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,185
All right. You've seen
what I can do.

763
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:04,354
You either want to use
my talents or you don't.

764
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:07,057
If you don't, I seek another
cabal, and we do it that way.

765
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,259
We need you.
We definitely need you.

766
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,250
Indeed.

767
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:11,929
Bowler... Evelyn...

768
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,397
Carol.

769
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,265
Will you join
our little ragtag trio?

770
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:19,269
I think you mean quartet...

771
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,966
What are you talking about?
There's five of us.

772
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:26,808
Nobody's green lit new
memberships, so just chill out.

773
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:30,380
Granted, you've got a good
arm. I'll give you that.

774
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,148
But we're in a lead cad...

775
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,650
Cadre.

776
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,018
You're in.
Welcome aboard.

777
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,953
Guys, would you...

778
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,922
What? What's the problem?

779
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,554
Welcome.

780
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,158
What?

781
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,890
Nothing. No problem.
Welcome aboard.

782
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,039
So what's up? Are Spleen
and I on the team or not?

783
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,875
In my opinion, which used
to matter around here,

784
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,577
we shouldn't be
flinging memberships

785
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:03,413
at every guy who puts together a
pair of matching gloves and boots.

786
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,382
You guys just be sure to jump
in when the action starts.

787
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,318
You do your share,
we'll keep you around.

788
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,419
Maybe.

789
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,489
So you're a British man who
converted to Islam like Cat Stevens?

790
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:18,292
No. Until the early part of this century,
India was part of the British Empire,

791
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,897
whose government there
was called the British Raj,

792
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,299
after the Hindi word
for "sovereignty. "

793
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,400
Furthermore...

794
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,869
Wait. So sorry. What?

795
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:28,138
Dad.

796
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,608
No, he's not
a commie nor a fruit.

797
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,743
Sorry.

798
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:36,079
His ignorance embarrasses me.

799
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,316
Sorry, but am I to understand
you've inserted your father's skull

800
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,352
inside of that ball
for bowling?

801
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:44,844
No. The guy at
the pro shop did it.

802
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,659
That was Casanova's limo.

803
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,896
You bet your sweet bippy it was.
Let's turn this sucker around!

804
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:55,058
He's probably got
Amazing in there.

805
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,537
Here we go.

806
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,605
I feel carsick.

807
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,733
Great.

808
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,803
So tell me, who can we count on
seeing at my banquet tomorrow?

809
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,548
All the top gangs
are gonna be there, Cas.

810
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:14,518
They want to know
what you got up your sleeve.

811
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,657
Mr. Casanova,
I think we're being followed.

812
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,870
Let us say hello.

813
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,349
What's he doing?

814
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,881
He's either very smart
or very dumb.

815
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:08,199
Hello.

816
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:11,305
I would like a double burger
with the large fries.

817
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:14,277
Do you boys
want something to drink?

818
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,512
We think you did something
bad to Captain Amazing.

819
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:20,683
We would like you
to tell us where he is.

820
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,916
Captain who? This name does
not ring any bells with me.

821
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,756
I don't like your tone,
Frankenpuss.

822
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,359
Do yourself a favor
and don't punch my clock.

823
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,886
I'm a Pantera's box
you do not want to open.

824
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,396
It is Pandora.

825
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,965
Please don't correct me.

826
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:37,300
It sickens me.

827
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,668
You guys never learn, do you?

828
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,734
Apparently we don't, ass.

829
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:44,674
I know you.

830
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:45,836
You don't know me.

831
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,244
You knew my father.
Sal.

832
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,645
Carmine.
Carmine.

833
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:52,882
Carmine? The Bowler?

834
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:53,950
Yep.

835
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:55,418
You're Baby Bowler?

836
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,653
Is that a problem?

837
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:57,712
Hello.

838
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,116
I'm the guy that gave
your daddy the shaft.

839
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,319
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you:

840
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,796
Where is Captain Amazing?

841
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,528
And a diet Pepsi
with a little bit of ice.

842
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,040
Hey, Shove!

843
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,380
Boys, let's go.

844
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:29,313
Fork yourself!

845
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:35,989
Pull!

846
00:51:54,378 --> 00:51:56,045
Come on, Roy,
let's get out of here.

847
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,140
Come on, Furious! Let's go!

848
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,284
People who live
in glass houses, shouldn't.

849
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,185
Because this is what happens!

850
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:06,289
Come on!
That's enough!

851
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,224
Come on. Get out of the way.

852
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,395
The roof is on fire! The roof!

853
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:15,598
The roof is on fire!

854
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,297
We don't need no water.
We don't need no water.

855
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,133
Here comes Daddy.

856
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:37,110
Go, go, go!

857
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:59,776
I would like to make a toast to
our first straightout victory.

858
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,244
Stunning victory.
Here, here.

859
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:03,146
The relationship you have
with your mother

860
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:05,214
affects every other
dynamic in your life.

861
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,377
What? What?
It's true, quite true.

862
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:12,151
Yes, a father's role is vital in a
child's life as well. I know this.

863
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,457
No, I'm not disrespecting you.

864
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:18,628
You have to respect me too. You have to
allow me to have conversations in a bar

865
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:20,797
and talk to my new friends.

866
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,891
Anyway, I'm an adult now.

867
00:53:24,068 --> 00:53:25,768
Do you want to go
back in the bag?

868
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,864
Is that how we're gonna do
it now? You make the rules.

869
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,240
If you don't zip it...

870
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:37,880
Sheesh.

871
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,651
I was going to say that parents
can be quite problematic.

872
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:42,983
Tell me about it.

873
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:51,728
There's not enough beer in the
world. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

874
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,163
It's okay. It's okay.
Listen.

875
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,165
You've got to live
in truth. Correct?

876
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,965
The woman's a tiger.

877
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:06,576
Barkeep, another round

878
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:10,445
for my sweet team
of superfriends.

879
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,412
Barkeep, another round
for the super,

880
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,886
super bellies.

881
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:20,089
That's what's so cool
about this team:

882
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,027
Everyone has their own powers for
all these different situations.

883
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:25,828
Pull my finger.

884
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:33,336
What?

885
00:54:33,337 --> 00:54:35,305
I was just thinking.

886
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:38,999
I was wondering when we might
see your super power.

887
00:54:41,345 --> 00:54:44,576
It'll happen, kid.
Don't worry.

888
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,719
I say, "sabatage. "
"Sabatage?"

889
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,954
The Shoveler
is hammered!

890
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,288
The Shoveler is hammered!

891
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,133
So what's the name
of this team?

892
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,401
How about the Super Squad?

893
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:08,861
How about the Six Dead Guys
in Their Stupid Costumes?

894
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,508
No. The Magnificent Dead Guys.
How about that?

895
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,773
What about
the Legendary Superfreaks?

896
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:17,472
Way too positive.
They totaled our car.

897
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,591
Ready?

898
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:29,650
Ready!

899
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:32,461
Aim.

900
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:33,589
Aim!

901
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:36,128
I love you!

902
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,058
Fire!

903
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,479
Six Very Nearly Dead Guys With
a Temporary Reprieve.

904
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,048
That's it. That's your name.

905
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,516
Six Jive Turkeys.

906
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:54,617
Dig, man?

907
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:55,985
Yeah! Dig, man!

908
00:55:55,986 --> 00:56:00,355
That's your name.
Kill you later, superlosers!

909
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:08,956
Criminy.
You're the Sphinx.

910
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,828
And you are fools.

911
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:12,969
Tonight

912
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:15,000
you proved

913
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,765
your inexperience.

914
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,510
The wise man knows
that he is weakest

915
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,446
when he thinks himself strong.

916
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:25,815
Whoa.

917
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,648
This is serious.

918
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:29,742
Terribly mysterious.

919
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,887
Casanova Frankenstein

920
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,851
is no ordinary villain.

921
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,725
To fight him,

922
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,695
you must have
extraordinary skill.

923
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,231
Thank you for that
little piece of information.

924
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,000
I wouldn't have thought...

925
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,434
Excuse me!

926
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,136
Does anybody have any manners?

927
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,237
I don't know. Do I?

928
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,505
I don't know. Do you?
Do I?

929
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:52,375
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

930
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:54,310
I don't know. You tell me.
Do I mind what? Do I?

931
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,611
Silence!

932
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,681
We'll have to
separate you two.

933
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:01,413
Is that what you want?
You want to be separated?

934
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:03,084
He started it.

935
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:08,452
You must be
like the wolf pack,

936
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,894
not like the six pack.

937
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,659
Teamwork. Yes!

938
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:17,461
You were not ready to face
so great an enemy.

939
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:22,266
Not until you have vanquished
the enemy within yourselves.

940
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:23,696
Yes!

941
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,742
It's cool, isn't it?

942
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:30,313
It goes right up to the point
of being, like, confusing.

943
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:34,410
It's leadership.
It's what we've been missing.

944
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,717
Yes, I quite agree.

945
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:41,023
Sphinx, will you guide our
motley little gang of men at arms?

946
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,793
Hey! Wait a minute.

947
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,728
Are you serious? Come on.

948
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:48,097
Will you shape us,
mold us?

949
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:51,133
Please unify us
and make us whole.

950
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,034
To learn my teachings,

951
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,198
I must first teach you

952
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,202
how to learn.

953
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,221
Learn to hide your strikes
from your opponent,

954
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,317
and you'll more easily
strike his hide.

955
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,769
How many weapons do you wield?

956
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,828
Just one, Sphinx.

957
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:31,673
No. The fist, the knee,
the elbow, the head!

958
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,609
You must lash out
with every limb

959
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,170
like the octopus
who plays the drums.

960
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,814
Why am I doing this again?

961
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,388
When you can balance
a tack hammer on your head,

962
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:48,586
you will head off your foes
with a balanced attack.

963
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,461
And why am I wearing the
watermelon on my feet?

964
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,668
I don't remember
telling you to do that.

965
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,870
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait.

966
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,789
I believe in my powers.

967
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,296
I believe in my powers.

968
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:34,798
I believe in the powers
of my teammates.

969
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:38,165
I believe in the powers
of my teammates.

970
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:42,845
I trust in my powers.

971
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:45,846
I trust in the powers
of my teammates.

972
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:49,745
I trust in the powers
of my teammates.

973
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:54,390
This team must learn
to work together

974
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:58,555
or, mark my words,
it will be torn apart!

975
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,861
Now, gather round.

976
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,894
Gather round.
Embrace one another.

977
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:09,438
Gather round.
Embrace one another quickly.

978
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,736
Roy.

979
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:17,079
Why do you stand aside
while the others practice?

980
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,878
"Practice?"

981
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:21,584
That's not practicing.
That's group hugging.

982
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:24,213
We should be busting in
on Casanova right now.

983
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:28,981
He who questions training, only
trains himself at asking questions.

984
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:32,660
What?

985
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:40,736
Who was looking for
the pinking shears?

986
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:41,871
Oh, that was me.

987
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:46,536
Yes, work well on
your new costumes, my friends.

988
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,869
For when you care
for what is outside,

989
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:53,278
what is inside cares for you.

990
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,417
The clock is ticking here.

991
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:59,021
Are we gonna sew dresses all day
or are we gonna rescue Amazing?

992
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,723
I need a thimble.
Does anybody...

993
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:02,091
Patience, my son.

994
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,260
To summon your power for
the conflict to come,

995
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:07,389
you must first have power
over that which conflicts you.

996
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:11,327
Am I the only one who finds these
sayings just a little formulaic?

997
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:14,203
"If you want to push something
down, you have to pull it up. "

998
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,272
"If you want to go left,
you have to go right. "

999
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:21,043
Your temper is very quick, but until
you learn to master your rage...

1000
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,536
Your rage will
become your master?

1001
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:26,482
That's what you
were gonna say, right?

1002
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:27,950
Right?

1003
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,248
Not necessarily.

1004
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,980
That's it. I'm out of here.

1005
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,891
Thanks for all the advice, Mr. Misterioso,
but it's time to get busy with it.

1006
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,059
Come on, Eddie.
Let's go.

1007
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,127
No, Roy.

1008
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:39,595
I think he's getting results.

1009
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,463
Yeah, and the biggest one is
that we're all out of here.

1010
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,992
Come on, Jeff. Let's peel
some wheelies. Let's go.

1011
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,803
I don't want to leave
the Sphinx.

1012
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,738
Okay, how about
the rest of you?

1013
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,441
Do you want to play Suzie
Homemaker with Captain Conundrum

1014
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,536
or do you want
to be superheroes?

1015
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:06,180
Okay, I don't need a compass to
tell me which way the wind shines.

1016
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,024
Roy, wait.
Let's talk about this.

1017
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,859
No, let's not talk about it!

1018
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,262
You want to sit here, make Halloween
outfits with Little Red Riding Hood

1019
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:15,755
or you want to
take care of business?

1020
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:21,834
Well, I guess from now on I
ride in a wolf pack of one.

1021
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,081
We should go after him.

1022
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,216
He's okay. Just let him go. He's a baby.

1023
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,385
We've never gone
into battle without him.

1024
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:38,053
If you love him so much,
why don't you marry him?

1025
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,922
I don't know. Why don't you
marry him? Why don't you?

1026
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,523
Why don't you?
Why don't you?

1027
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:43,492
Bowler, Shoveler, please!

1028
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:48,497
Sphinx, what wisdom can you give
us in this, our most clouded hour?

1029
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,193
Yeah, what do we do?

1030
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,069
The loss of manpower
can be replaced

1031
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,198
by the addition
of firepower.

1032
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:02,111
Well, I won't use guns. I've
been crystal clear about that.

1033
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,445
He won't even
use a knife.

1034
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,015
You're not going to start
with that again, are you?

1035
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:08,007
Casanova will have
many weapons.

1036
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,911
To beat him, you will have to have
more than forks and flatulence.

1037
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,761
Heller.

1038
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:30,036
"Dr. A. Heller:
Weapons designer,

1039
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,039
"innovator, inventor,
world changer. "

1040
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:56,932
Why does he live in a
deserted amusement park?

1041
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,992
Because he's
an eccentric genius.

1042
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:02,071
I'll take point. You two
flank. Let's triangulate.

1043
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:03,906
Equilateral or isosceles?

1044
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:04,999
Just go.

1045
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,825
Who would want
to rent a chicken?

1046
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:29,024
This is weird in here.
It's scary and weird.

1047
01:04:40,477 --> 01:04:42,311
Oh, there's
another chicken.

1048
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:44,303
Crazy chicken world.

1049
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,156
Dr. Heller?

1050
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:00,790
We come in peace.

1051
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,632
Shovel Head?

1052
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:06,368
The Shoveler. Yes, sir.
We met at the old folks' home.

1053
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:09,430
Of course.
Fork Man?

1054
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:13,242
I'm the Spleen. If you want to know
what my power is, pull my finger.

1055
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,477
Please, don't!
Don't, sir. Don't.

1056
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:19,548
Dr. Heller, we're on a
mission. We've come for weapons.

1057
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:22,951
Shouldn't we see a diploma
or something first?

1058
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:26,684
You came to the right place,
baby. Step into my office.

1059
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,484
Where are your friends?

1060
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,125
What friends?

1061
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:40,302
Your friends. I thought you
guys were in a club or something.

1062
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:42,905
You mean a team? A Super Team?

1063
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:44,006
Yeah.

1064
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:48,569
Apparently, it's now the
Super Sphinx Team or something.

1065
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:50,212
You had a falling out?

1066
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:51,647
Yeah, kind of.

1067
01:05:54,751 --> 01:05:56,785
Is it okay if I just
have the coffee?

1068
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,853
I'm not very hungry.

1069
01:05:57,854 --> 01:05:59,117
Sure.

1070
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,320
Hey,

1071
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,388
what time do you get off work?

1072
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,960
Half hour. Why?

1073
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:15,270
No reason. I was just thinking
maybe I could...

1074
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,706
It might be a good idea
if I walked you home.

1075
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,309
The city's been
real, real dangerous

1076
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,335
since Amazing went M.I.A.

1077
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:28,083
I've been working on
some jujitsu moves that...

1078
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:32,254
Just probably be safer on
everybody's part if...

1079
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:37,318
Also, it would be great
to just walk you home.

1080
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:40,759
Sure.

1081
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:49,570
This will even things up
a little bit. What is it?

1082
01:06:49,906 --> 01:06:51,139
Look at this!

1083
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:53,542
Don't point at me.

1084
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:56,308
You're gonna kill somebody.

1085
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:59,448
Listen, everything here
is nonlethal.

1086
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,477
"Nonlethal"? What?

1087
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,420
I don't make anything
that's deadly.

1088
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,823
I see.
How delightfully eccentric,

1089
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:11,560
while, simultaneously, being
a complete waste of our time.

1090
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,462
No offense. Shall we?
Thank you, Doctor.

1091
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:14,529
I said good day.

1092
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,731
See you, Doc.

1093
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:19,568
That is why, in general, a
mad scientist is less desirable

1094
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:22,334
than a garden-variety
scientist.

1095
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:26,475
Incoming!

1096
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,511
Look out! Out of the way! Watch out!

1097
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,263
Doc, you're a genius.

1098
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,435
A canned tornado, huh?

1099
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:03,879
Totally nonlethal,
but totally effective.

1100
01:08:04,147 --> 01:08:05,948
What is this thing you were
handling before?

1101
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,516
That's a shrinker.

1102
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:10,452
How do you know?
Oh, a manual. Cool.

1103
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:14,523
That's a high-temperature
fabric adhesive liquid projector

1104
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:17,653
based on simple
dry-cleaning technology.

1105
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:22,164
You aim that at a guy,
and I'll tell you something

1106
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,534
his clothes get so tight
he can't even breathe.

1107
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,069
I can trick that out
with a clam shell holster.

1108
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:29,237
It comes with
a leather carrying case.

1109
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,640
It's got a wad cutter
and a full warranty.

1110
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:32,774
Nicely done.

1111
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,343
What do you call this?

1112
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:36,211
Careful, careful.
That's a blame-thrower.

1113
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:39,181
"A blamethrower"?
I'm sorry.

1114
01:08:39,182 --> 01:08:41,216
Your bad attitude
is hurting this team!

1115
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,118
Stop spitting on me!
I already took a shower!

1116
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,487
You need another shower
'cause you stink!

1117
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,089
Want me to get
that zit for you?

1118
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,457
I'm really shaking!

1119
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,325
I'm sorry! I'm sorry
if I spit all the time!

1120
01:08:54,664 --> 01:08:56,932
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1121
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:59,402
No, no, no. No.

1122
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:03,739
Doctor, you are a genius.

1123
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,968
That's what the card says.

1124
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,672
I still want to be with them
when they go rescue Amazing.

1125
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,980
So why don't you just go back?

1126
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,282
No, I couldn't go back. I just
left this morning. That would be...

1127
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,484
This is my place.

1128
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,816
That would be ridiculous.

1129
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,887
They're your friends.
They'll understand.

1130
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,990
It's clearly what
you want to do.

1131
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:26,261
That actually could work.
I'm Mr. Furious, right?

1132
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,230
I'm unpredictable.
I'm a loose cannon.

1133
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:30,432
I go storming off. Why
can't I come storming back?

1134
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:32,701
I mean, it's all in
how you play it, right?

1135
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:34,536
Or don't play it.

1136
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:39,100
Just go back, say you're sorry
and help them save Captain Amazing.

1137
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:42,944
You think there's a really
angry way I could say I'm sorry?

1138
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,613
Just 'cause
that's kind of my...

1139
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:47,879
I gotta stick with the anger
thing 'cause people like that.

1140
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,681
Maybe people like you for
who you really are.

1141
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:56,958
You know?

1142
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,830
Okay, I'm gonna go.

1143
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,364
You should go find
your friends.

1144
01:10:21,284 --> 01:10:22,284
Good.

1145
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:26,221
Now, the three of you will be
like the eagle's claw.

1146
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:29,516
You will snatch up the hostage
and carry him to safety.

1147
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:34,653
We three scouts are like the eagle's
eye: Ever watchful for danger.

1148
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:36,998
Are you ready?

1149
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,200
Yes.
Ready.

1150
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:42,638
Then let operation Three-Eyed,
Three-Legged Eagle begin.

1151
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:48,677
Shotgun!

1152
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:50,612
I think not, my friend.

1153
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:01,021
Silly twit.

1154
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,551
Give me a second.

1155
01:11:08,231 --> 01:11:09,331
Hey.

1156
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:10,356
What's up?

1157
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,525
Not a lot.
What's up with you?

1158
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,693
Nothing much.

1159
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:19,307
Have you seen
my address book?

1160
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:20,776
No. What did it look like?

1161
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:26,313
It's denim. It says "Hang loose"
on it with a picture of a kitten.

1162
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:28,849
No.

1163
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:33,822
You should probably think
about where you saw it last.

1164
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:35,188
Right.

1165
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:44,925
I should probably...

1166
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:51,336
Eddie, there's something
I want to say, okay?

1167
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:55,310
I'm angry about being
left out of this mission,

1168
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,813
and I'm angry about what's
happening with this team,

1169
01:11:57,848 --> 01:12:00,578
but I'm... I'm...

1170
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,287
Oh, boy.

1171
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,520
Temperature rising.

1172
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:12,588
Vision blurring.

1173
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,231
Rage taking over.

1174
01:12:16,232 --> 01:12:17,499
Roy, I got an idea.

1175
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,533
Why don't you come with us?

1176
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:19,626
Okay.

1177
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:21,833
Rage subsiding.

1178
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,535
Pulse slowing.

1179
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,068
Anger fading.

1180
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:34,442
That was
quick thinking, Eddie.

1181
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,387
I wouldn't want anyone
to get hurt.

1182
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:10,185
Drink, drink!

1183
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:11,278
Mazel tov!

1184
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:19,194
Right then. I'll go
and scout out a way in.

1185
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:20,495
What should the signal be?

1186
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,097
"Karee, karee, karoo. "

1187
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:24,532
No, no, what about,
"Whippoorwill, whippoorwill"?

1188
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:25,800
No. "Karee karoo. "

1189
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:26,791
Yes, but isn't that better?

1190
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,603
Not interested.

1191
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,698
Enough with the cuckoo!

1192
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:31,973
We have to find
an open window.

1193
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,174
That's what I just said.

1194
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,041
Go, go!

1195
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,748
Does everyone have a drink?

1196
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:44,853
Yes, we all do!

1197
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:45,912
You're all good?

1198
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:49,385
Good. Well, it is wonderful
in my heart

1199
01:13:50,493 --> 01:13:54,062
to see so many
familiar faces once again.

1200
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:57,055
The Susies,
assassins from the East.

1201
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:03,705
The Suits, downsizing all
those who dare oppose them.

1202
01:14:03,706 --> 01:14:07,108
And the Furriers,
always dressed to kill.

1203
01:14:11,714 --> 01:14:17,052
And the Frat Boys, still on
probation for lethal hazing.

1204
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:18,119
Phi Zeta!

1205
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,454
And, of course,
the Not So Goody Mob,

1206
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,993
putting the rhyme into crime!

1207
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:27,162
The pleasure's all mine,
Frankenstein.

1208
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:30,198
We're about to perpetrate some
evil on these Champion City people.

1209
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:32,701
Rapping, snapping, capping.

1210
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:37,435
Tonight, we are having quite
a party, a surprise party.

1211
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:40,999
I have a little something
up my sleeve,

1212
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:44,804
and I'm not just talking about
the wart on my elbow.

1213
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:53,982
I have created
a beautiful machine

1214
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:57,454
that is going to encourage
our fellow citizens,

1215
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:00,729
to share my vision

1216
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,330
of the world!

1217
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,627
Can you dig it?

1218
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,997
What about Captain Amazing?

1219
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,440
That is an excellent
question, Big Tobacco.

1220
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:19,344
What are we gonna do about the greatest
superhero Champion City has ever known?

1221
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:24,477
For the answer, I want
you all to walk this way.

1222
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,481
Dude, can we bring
the brewskis?

1223
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,793
Yes, of course. You may
absolutely bring the brewskis.

1224
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,667
Things look
pretty quiet to me.

1225
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:49,144
Invisible Boy,
did you just let one go?

1226
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:50,645
No, that wasn't me.

1227
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:51,807
Well, it wasn't me.

1228
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,115
Don't run! He'll shoot!

1229
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,061
Is he doing what
I think he's doing?

1230
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,905
Just go with it.

1231
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:30,819
Can anybody see anything?

1232
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:31,986
Hey!

1233
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,755
Who said, "Hey"?
Not me.

1234
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,623
Eddie, you don't
have to say, "Not me," okay?

1235
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,626
If someone says, "Who?"
And you say...

1236
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,391
Hey, morons,
over here.

1237
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,022
It's Captain Amazing!

1238
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,433
We've been looking for you.

1239
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,926
Turn on the light switch
behind you.

1240
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:54,999
My, my. Well, well.
We meet again, Captain?

1241
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:56,578
We're here
to rescue you.

1242
01:16:56,579 --> 01:16:57,705
Yeah.

1243
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:02,083
I'm Blue Raja. Do you recall
me? Master of silverware.

1244
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,919
You told me to keep up the good
work after the Red Eye skirmish.

1245
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,356
I meet so many people in
this business, but I think so.

1246
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:11,593
Could you two locate the master
ignition switch on the main console?

1247
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:13,728
Maybe you could open that up?

1248
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:15,697
Have you out in two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

1249
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:17,165
Frightfully uncomfortable. Great.

1250
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,433
How does this work?

1251
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,068
I've seen one of these things.

1252
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:22,871
You've got to push
this thing in and twist it.

1253
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:24,139
Don't force it!

1254
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,640
She's right,
my little friend.

1255
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,610
This contraption is, in fact,
a weapon of mass destruction.

1256
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:30,912
Casanova plans to turn it
against the city at midnight.

1257
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:32,881
Something's happening.

1258
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:38,119
Okay, very good. On the wall to your left
you should see two toggles side-by-side.

1259
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,249
"Toggles"? What do you mean?
You talking about switches?

1260
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:42,991
I see them, Captain.

1261
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,125
Thank you.

1262
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,660
Flip the first toggle.

1263
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,719
Flipping.

1264
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:50,298
Excellent work.

1265
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,366
Now, flip the...

1266
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:52,467
Jolly good work, team!

1267
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:55,528
Could you just
stay over there, please?

1268
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,431
Of course.

1269
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:01,472
Sorry.

1270
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,112
Now flip the second toggle.

1271
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:05,513
Do as he says.

1272
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,539
The man knows
what of he speaks.

1273
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,351
I'm just gonna
ask you directly:

1274
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,320
Do you know billionaire
Lance Hunt?

1275
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:13,846
It's me.

1276
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,392
No, I'm kidding with you.
I've always wanted to do that.

1277
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:18,526
What's next?

1278
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,461
I just told you,
flip the second toggle.

1279
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,163
Again?

1280
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,222
What do you mean?

1281
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,500
Flip the toggle twice?

1282
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:26,668
No, no, no.

1283
01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:29,900
Don't do that. Just flip it
again now, one time. Flip it.

1284
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,040
Does he understand
what I'm asking?

1285
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:36,477
Hold on a second. Exactly how
many toggle flips in total,

1286
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,470
are involved
in this procedure?

1287
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:42,380
I just... It's... Seven!

1288
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:44,485
Seven?
Flip it!

1289
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:45,753
Seven?

1290
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,689
Everybody, hold the phone.

1291
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:51,626
You phrased that incorrectly. We need
to know how many toggle flips are needed,

1292
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:54,762
not counting the gratuitous
toggle flip you may have asked for

1293
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:55,830
in a moment of panic.

1294
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:56,764
Flip it!

1295
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,033
Could we just start again?

1296
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:01,069
Is there some sort of
reset button on this thing?

1297
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,638
No, you little freak, there's
no button for resetting.

1298
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:05,540
Flip the switch, lady.
Don't stare at me.

1299
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:07,041
Lift your left arm.
Flip it, you moron!

1300
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:08,376
You're a moron!

1301
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:09,477
I am not a moron.

1302
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,746
Do not call her a moron.
That's not cool.

1303
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,448
I will do it!

1304
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:15,149
Flip the switch, lady!
Don't look at me like that!

1305
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,948
It's this one, yes?

1306
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,411
Wrong switch.

1307
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:40,942
Everybody heard me say
"reset button," right?

1308
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,810
Oh, my God,
we killed him.

1309
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:46,613
What do you mean "we"?
I was right here.

1310
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,996
I'm gonna check his pulse.

1311
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,339
I don't think
he's gonna pull through.

1312
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,832
Somebody's coming.
We gotta get outta here.

1313
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:16,906
Everybody should just keep
holding their horses.

1314
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,649
Go, go, go.

1315
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,722
What the hell, man?

1316
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,597
This sucker's dead.

1317
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:38,396
What happened to him?

1318
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:44,196
As you can see,
I have taken Captain Amazing

1319
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,608
out of the picture.

1320
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,704
It's time for us to rule.

1321
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:56,317
Tonight at midnight, I'm
going to do to Champion City

1322
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:58,844
what I have done
to its greatest superhero.

1323
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:04,022
And there'll still be time
to go up, get down and boogie.

1324
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:07,128
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1325
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:08,858
Where's
Captain Amazing?

1326
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:10,965
There's been
a bit of a cock-up.

1327
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:14,425
Guys, I think we got a little
bigger fish to fry right now.

1328
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,238
What the hell was
that machine in there?

1329
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,901
I don't know. But I know
where we can go to find out.

1330
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,709
The vermin are back, Tony.

1331
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:33,247
Vermin should be
exterminated, Casanova.

1332
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:38,752
A fish fork is no match
for my machine!

1333
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:42,995
But I think we should take out
some insurance.

1334
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:45,800
Don't you think?

1335
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:47,635
It's
a psychofrakulator.

1336
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:51,973
It creates a cloud of radically
fluctuating free-deviant chaotrons

1337
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,941
which penetrate
the synaptic relays.

1338
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:57,208
It's concatenated with a
synchronous transport switch

1339
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,544
that creates
a virtual tributary.

1340
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:04,452
It's focused onto
a biobolic reflector.

1341
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:08,856
And what happens is that
hallucinations become reality

1342
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,759
and the brain is literally
fried from within.

1343
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,827
Where would you get
something like that?

1344
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:13,895
I don't know.

1345
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:15,930
They used to say
it couldn't be built.

1346
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:19,734
The equations were so complex that
most of the scientists who worked on it

1347
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:21,202
wound up in the insane asylum.

1348
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:24,605
Which is where Casanova's been
hanging for the last 20 years.

1349
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:27,441
If he turned that thing on the city,
it'll waste everything in sight.

1350
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,643
Not "if. " When.

1351
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:29,811
We need Captain Amazing.

1352
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:32,079
Yes, but, unfortunately,
we just killed him.

1353
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,276
Unfortunately,
you killed him.

1354
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,184
Just because you're having
problems at home

1355
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:37,652
don't mean you can go around
killing people.

1356
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:42,113
"Oh, sorry. Mummy. I'm
English. I didn't mean it. "

1357
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:45,126
K- I-L-L-E-D.
You killed him.

1358
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,662
You killed him. You did. You were
the one who flicked the switch.

1359
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:50,792
It's the same difference.
He's still dead.

1360
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:52,667
You did kind of...

1361
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:53,862
Sphinx!

1362
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:58,940
What in heaven's name
do we do?

1363
01:22:58,941 --> 01:23:00,408
Sometimes,

1364
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:04,974
the true hero is the one
with the courage to run away.

1365
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,281
I like the way
this man thinks.

1366
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:08,443
Let's run.

1367
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,551
We can't run.

1368
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:13,351
Oh, yes. It's been
established that we can run.

1369
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:19,725
This is egg salad loaded with cholesterol.
The wife won't even let me touch it.

1370
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:25,300
Hardly seems to matter now. 'Cause
chances are, we're already dead.

1371
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:27,735
Amazing is gone.

1372
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:30,771
There's no use waiting for the
cavalry, because as of this moment,

1373
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,740
the cavalry is us.

1374
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:34,709
Yeah, but I don't
wanna get frakulated.

1375
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,210
Psychofrakulated.

1376
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,512
We still get frakulated.

1377
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,247
This is our fight,
whether we like it or not.

1378
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:40,815
Just we few.

1379
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:43,046
We're not your
classic superheroes.

1380
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:46,250
We're not the favorites.
We're the other guys.

1381
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:49,782
We're the guys nobody
ever bets on.

1382
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,027
But I tell you what I think.

1383
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,828
You and that ball of yours have an
appointment that you've gotta keep.

1384
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:59,997
Invisible Boy, I think
it's time you were seen.

1385
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:02,696
Sphinx, you have
trained us well.

1386
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:07,575
Dr. Heller, you might just
have given us the edge we need.

1387
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:10,636
Spleen, I don't wanna
stand behind you.

1388
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:13,176
But I'll fight beside you
with pride.

1389
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:16,209
Jeff, you've got
a rare and beautiful gift.

1390
01:24:16,952 --> 01:24:19,717
The city needs you
tonight. And, Roy,

1391
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:21,689
in all the years
I've known you,

1392
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:24,182
I've never seen you
walk away from a fight.

1393
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:26,694
Why, you lifted
a city bus once, man.

1394
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:29,926
I think you've got what it
takes to handle Casanova.

1395
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,659
We're all in over our
heads, and we know it.

1396
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:37,038
But if we take on this fight,
those of us who survive it

1397
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:41,442
will forever after show our scars
with pride and say, "That's right.

1398
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:44,677
"I was there.
I fought the good fight. "

1399
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,747
So, what do you say?

1400
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:51,743
Do we all gather together and
go kick some Casanova butt,

1401
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:55,156
or do I eat this sandwich?

1402
01:24:55,157 --> 01:24:58,752
I say, what the fork.
Let's do it.

1403
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:02,697
If we're gonna bust
into that mansion,

1404
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:04,332
you're gonna need more than
a station wagon.

1405
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,367
At the auto yard, there's this
old Herkimer battle jitney.

1406
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:07,702
Sally's always telling me
to junk it.

1407
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:10,204
Wait. You have
a Herkimer battle jitney?

1408
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:13,374
That's the finest non-lethal
military vehicle ever made.

1409
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:16,210
All right, we'll meet at the
junkyard. We'll go from there.

1410
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:18,578
I shall need more forks,
I'm afraid.

1411
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:21,615
Those of you with loved ones,
say good-bye before we go.

1412
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,585
You may not get
another chance.

1413
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:31,759
Sei gesund.

1414
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:42,668
Hey, Mom.

1415
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:45,605
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

1416
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:48,068
I was just...

1417
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,579
I'm a superhero, Mother.

1418
01:25:58,186 --> 01:25:59,820
A superhero?

1419
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,056
An effete British superhero,
to be precise.

1420
01:26:02,057 --> 01:26:05,186
I am pilfering your tableware
because I hurl it.

1421
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:09,730
I hurl it with a deadly accuracy.
The Blue Raja is my name.

1422
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:12,733
Yes, I know. I don't wear much blue,
and I speak in a British accent.

1423
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:14,702
But if you know your history, it
really does make perfect sense.

1424
01:26:14,703 --> 01:26:18,339
The point is, your boy's a
limey fork-flinger, Mother.

1425
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:21,208
Hard cheese to swallow,
but there it is.

1426
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:23,371
What will the bridge
club think?

1427
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:29,675
You need more forks?

1428
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:36,516
These belonged to your
great-great grandmother.

1429
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:39,226
I was saving these
for your wedding day.

1430
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:44,222
But from the looks of it, that
day, it's probably a long way off.

1431
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,463
Mom, you're taking this
incredibly well.

1432
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,305
I've always known
you were special,

1433
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:55,209
but I just never realized
how special.

1434
01:27:00,816 --> 01:27:02,340
I'd better get going.

1435
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:04,452
I've got a city to save.

1436
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:06,182
Jeffrey?
Yeah?

1437
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:07,913
Do the accent.

1438
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,961
I'd love to stay and chitchat,
but I fear I must away with me.

1439
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:17,164
Our metropolis is in
the clutches of madmen.

1440
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:19,500
Jeffrey? Cheerio.

1441
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:20,668
I really should get going.

1442
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:22,034
Okay.

1443
01:27:25,307 --> 01:27:27,241
Thanks, Ma.

1444
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:39,312
I said I was gonna leave
you, and I meant it.

1445
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:44,782
The city's in peril, Lucille.
We're the best hope they've got.

1446
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:48,087
Eddie, please don't start.

1447
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:50,598
I don't expect you
to believe me.

1448
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:54,262
I just came by
to tell you that I love you.

1449
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,766
Tell the kids I love them.

1450
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:00,435
And now, good-bye.

1451
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,600
Good-bye, Eddie.

1452
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:06,241
I won't be here
when you come home.

1453
01:28:06,715 --> 01:28:08,883
Well, that's a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

1454
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:12,684
Otherwise, there may not be
a home to come back to.

1455
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,360
Wish me luck.

1456
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:34,942
Hi.

1457
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:35,976
You okay?

1458
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,212
I wanted to say
I had a great time tonight.

1459
01:28:38,213 --> 01:28:40,381
And you were
really nice to me.

1460
01:28:40,382 --> 01:28:43,918
And I would love to,
to ask you out sometime.

1461
01:28:43,919 --> 01:28:47,388
But if I don't call you, I want
you to know it's because I'm dead.

1462
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:50,624
Me and my team, we're gonna
take on Casanova Frankenstein.

1463
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,294
And it's pretty much
a suicide mission.

1464
01:28:53,295 --> 01:28:57,527
So, if there is anything that
you wanna say to me,

1465
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:01,569
now would probably be a good
time to say it, just 'cause...

1466
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:03,637
Yeah, I got
a question for you.

1467
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:04,905
Cool. Kick it.

1468
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:06,602
What's your name?

1469
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:09,677
Do you mean my secret
identity? 'Cause I couldn't.

1470
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,408
No, I just,
you know, mean your name.

1471
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:15,239
My name.

1472
01:29:17,152 --> 01:29:18,346
Okay.

1473
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:23,515
It's Phoenix.

1474
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:27,024
Phoenix Dark.

1475
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:30,361
Dirk. Phoenix...

1476
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,700
Dark-Dirk.

1477
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:36,103
It was...
I was christened Dirk Steele,

1478
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,371
and I changed it to Phoenix.

1479
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,500
Forget about it.
It's okay.

1480
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:47,848
It's Roy.

1481
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,645
That's my name.
My name is...

1482
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,489
My real name is Roy.

1483
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:17,637
Just be Roy.

1484
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:31,525
Roy, the Roy. Yes, I'm Roy.

1485
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:33,193
Who is Roy? Roy is who?

1486
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,062
He's freaking out, man.

1487
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:37,798
Where's the guy who pretends
not to be Roy?

1488
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:39,967
We've had quite enough
of that. Just stop it.

1489
01:30:39,968 --> 01:30:42,970
Just snap out of it.
We're tired of it.

1490
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:47,431
I'm a wannabe. A true wannabe,
in the worst sense of the...

1491
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:49,677
You guys are gonna have to go
fight this battle without me.

1492
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:52,179
You start doubting your
super powers, you are shafted.

1493
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:55,683
If I had any super powers, I guess
I would be in trouble, but I don't.

1494
01:30:55,684 --> 01:30:57,311
What do I do?
I go...

1495
01:30:58,687 --> 01:31:01,121
What are you talking about?
You lifted a bus once.

1496
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,991
Precisely.
That story's legendary.

1497
01:31:03,992 --> 01:31:07,087
It was really more of a push,
really, than a lift.

1498
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:10,026
That still takes incredible
superhuman strength.

1499
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:12,833
It does, to push
an entire bus out the way.

1500
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:15,903
Actually, the driver kind of
had his foot on the accelerator,

1501
01:31:15,904 --> 01:31:18,105
just in the beginning, just to get
it going, then it actually was me.

1502
01:31:18,106 --> 01:31:20,234
But he kind of...

1503
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:24,511
Oh, shit.

1504
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,777
Excuse me.

1505
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:36,890
It's a process which results in
an accelerated flow of electrons

1506
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:39,059
that creates such
a powerful magnetic force.

1507
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,620
This is basically
like a huge electromagnet.

1508
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:44,925
Actually, it's
an electro-nuclear-magnet.

1509
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,667
It's the next
inevitable phase.

1510
01:31:46,668 --> 01:31:49,169
Vis, can you
close up those jockey boxes?

1511
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,304
Right on it.

1512
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:53,798
Let's get suited up.
We're out of here in five.

1513
01:31:58,279 --> 01:31:59,679
It's time.

1514
01:32:01,783 --> 01:32:03,182
Let's go.

1515
01:32:55,036 --> 01:32:56,236
Shotgun!

1516
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,871
I've already called it,
didn't I?

1517
01:32:57,872 --> 01:32:59,006
Have a seat, my friend.

1518
01:32:59,007 --> 01:33:00,338
Everybody ready?

1519
01:33:00,842 --> 01:33:02,743
And we have lift-off.

1520
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,678
May the forks
be with us.

1521
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:11,618
I'm sorry.
Too much throttle.

1522
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:13,287
That's cool.
I'm just gonna go.

1523
01:33:13,288 --> 01:33:14,721
Yo, sit down!

1524
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:16,020
All right,
here we go.

1525
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:32,102
Vaya con Dios.

1526
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:38,545
Somebody do something.
We need him.

1527
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:41,148
Let's do this.
You're a very furious man.

1528
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:43,083
Do you understand that?
No.

1529
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:46,286
You got a lot to be furious
about, and I'll tell you why.

1530
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:50,491
You're not well-liked. You're
abrasive and off-putting.

1531
01:33:50,492 --> 01:33:52,860
You try and say pithy things,
but your wit is a hindrance,

1532
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:54,862
and so therefore,
nothing is provocative.

1533
01:33:54,863 --> 01:33:57,965
It's just mixed metaphors. Now,
doesn't that make you angry?

1534
01:33:57,966 --> 01:33:59,933
Does it infuriate you?
No.

1535
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:02,961
It should. Are you angry? Come on, man!

1536
01:34:03,171 --> 01:34:05,239
Your penmanship is atrocious.

1537
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,174
You dress
like a male prostitute.

1538
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:15,545
Get real! I have
no powers whatsoever.

1539
01:34:15,917 --> 01:34:18,519
If he has no powers,
maybe I've got no powers.

1540
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,287
Maybe I can't turn
invisible at all.

1541
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:22,089
Do not go there,
my son.

1542
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:25,058
When you doubt your powers,
you give power to your doubts.

1543
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:29,196
I don't mean to be alarmist,
but it's half 11:00 already.

1544
01:34:29,197 --> 01:34:31,765
Thirty minutes till Casanova
blows up the city.

1545
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:35,896
Listen. We've got
a blind date with destiny.

1546
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:40,374
And it looks like
she's ordered the lobster.

1547
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:45,769
We're gonna ram the gate!

1548
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:07,396
What do you think? Should we
knock or just let ourselves in?

1549
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:25,210
Hit the ground!

1550
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:43,733
They're shooting!

1551
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:03,616
I hope this magnet
thing works.

1552
01:36:17,405 --> 01:36:19,874
It's working.

1553
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:31,976
Go! Go!

1554
01:36:34,422 --> 01:36:37,119
Everybody, into
the disco room.

1555
01:36:40,862 --> 01:36:44,059
Everyone, through here.
Keep moving.

1556
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:46,895
Focus, people. Focus.
Let's go.

1557
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:54,806
Hello?

1558
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:04,514
Wait!

1559
01:37:13,094 --> 01:37:14,892
Laser eye.

1560
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:28,709
I knew I should have brought
my large pie server.

1561
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:31,770
If we can't get through that
door, this battle is over.

1562
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:39,080
This is it. My time has come.

1563
01:37:40,488 --> 01:37:43,253
What are you
talking about?

1564
01:37:43,624 --> 01:37:45,425
Wait. Invisible Boy.

1565
01:37:45,426 --> 01:37:46,593
I wouldn't do that, if...

1566
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:48,328
Come back here.
You'll be cremated.

1567
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:49,863
It's all about me now.

1568
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:51,732
I'm the only one
that can save us.

1569
01:37:51,733 --> 01:37:52,866
He's right.

1570
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,334
Good luck, son.

1571
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:55,535
Nobody look at me.

1572
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:58,205
Don't look at him,
or it won't work.

1573
01:37:58,206 --> 01:37:59,799
I am transparent.

1574
01:38:00,274 --> 01:38:03,506
I am like the window.
I am see-through.

1575
01:38:03,778 --> 01:38:05,576
I'm like Saran Wrap.

1576
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:18,923
I did it! I'm invisible!
I really do have super powers.

1577
01:38:19,327 --> 01:38:21,090
Can you see me?

1578
01:38:21,329 --> 01:38:22,990
Yes.

1579
01:38:24,165 --> 01:38:25,999
Two hands there, son.

1580
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,267
Maybe you should put some shorts
on if you wanna keep fighting evil.

1581
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:34,174
Furriers, you will stay here
and delay the attackers.

1582
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:39,279
Not So Goody Mob, fight from behind.
The rest of you, into the atrium.

1583
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,181
And spread yourself out
for a second wave of attack.

1584
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:55,794
The door. Door.

1585
01:38:55,930 --> 01:39:00,094
On three. One, two, three.

1586
01:39:14,182 --> 01:39:15,615
Shrink them.

1587
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:32,894
I say, they've gone from
junior to missy petite.

1588
01:39:34,202 --> 01:39:36,727
Now that's a wedgie
she won't soon forget.

1589
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:40,465
My pants feel like
they're shrinking too.

1590
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:47,948
This way!

1591
01:39:47,949 --> 01:39:49,177
Look out!

1592
01:39:54,589 --> 01:39:56,056
I got a bone to pick with you.

1593
01:39:56,057 --> 01:39:58,758
Hold it, Little Daddy.

1594
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:01,354
You know what?
Y'all make me sick.

1595
01:40:10,705 --> 01:40:13,401
Give me that gun.

1596
01:40:16,744 --> 01:40:18,011
I got them.

1597
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,036
Disco forever!

1598
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:21,882
Invisible Boy, Spleen.
Susies.

1599
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,859
Dig this, Shovel Man.

1600
01:41:22,843 --> 01:41:24,477
Duck! It's the Susies!

1601
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:25,812
Grab the gun.

1602
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:26,803
It's stuck.

1603
01:41:27,615 --> 01:41:29,049
Coast clear?

1604
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:30,745
Shoot anyway.

1605
01:41:33,621 --> 01:41:34,854
I'm scared.

1606
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:36,323
No, you're not scared.
Be strong.

1607
01:41:36,324 --> 01:41:39,059
Say it with me
"I ain't scared of no Susies. "

1608
01:41:39,060 --> 01:41:40,160
I am scared of the Susies.

1609
01:41:40,161 --> 01:41:41,394
Say "I'm not scared
of no Susies. "

1610
01:41:41,395 --> 01:41:43,364
Come on. You ready?

1611
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:45,389
Let's go!

1612
01:41:53,541 --> 01:41:55,771
Dive! Dive!

1613
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:08,280
I'm hit!

1614
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:09,489
Where?

1615
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,691
I'm hit! Medic!
Medic! Man down!

1616
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:13,960
Man down! I can't feel my ass. What?

1617
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,962
I can't feel my ass.
What?

1618
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:17,364
Your powers still work?

1619
01:42:17,365 --> 01:42:20,266
My powers?
Weapons check.

1620
01:42:22,036 --> 01:42:24,337
Fire in the hole! Pull!

1621
01:42:28,909 --> 01:42:30,241
It'll do.

1622
01:42:30,845 --> 01:42:34,508
Go check on Spleen, okay?
Okay. All right.

1623
01:42:37,852 --> 01:42:39,419
You ought to run, Tony P.

1624
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,821
You can't hurt me,
Baby Bowler.

1625
01:42:43,124 --> 01:42:44,887
'Cause I'm protected

1626
01:42:46,694 --> 01:42:50,494
by the god of hair care.

1627
01:42:51,265 --> 01:42:53,666
And it's time to send you
back to your daddy.

1628
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:54,868
You killed my father.

1629
01:42:54,869 --> 01:42:57,338
That's right.
'Cause I'm a killer.

1630
01:42:57,538 --> 01:43:00,974
And you're not.
Let's face it, kid.

1631
01:43:00,975 --> 01:43:03,137
You don't have
the guts to kill me.

1632
01:43:03,444 --> 01:43:06,713
You're right. I don't
have the guts to kill you.

1633
01:43:06,714 --> 01:43:09,683
Because I'm better than you.
Yeah, that's right.

1634
01:43:09,984 --> 01:43:11,383
A lot better.

1635
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:16,186
You know, I may even find the
courage to forgive you someday.

1636
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:29,295
Carmine, on the other hand, feels
differently than I do about forgiveness.

1637
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:34,641
Now I'm going back to graduate
school. That was the agreement.

1638
01:43:34,642 --> 01:43:37,610
We're doing it. We're winning.
We're gonna pull this off.

1639
01:43:37,611 --> 01:43:39,841
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

1640
01:43:40,581 --> 01:43:44,484
Tell your funny-looking friends to
put down their weapons, Mr. Furious.

1641
01:43:44,485 --> 01:43:47,020
Just get out of here. He's
crazy. Save yourselves.

1642
01:43:47,021 --> 01:43:51,322
Put them down or I will slash your
girlfriend's pretty little throat.

1643
01:43:51,692 --> 01:43:54,218
Eddie, Jeff, do what he says.

1644
01:43:58,866 --> 01:44:00,595
Thank you.

1645
01:44:00,935 --> 01:44:04,803
It's so easy to get the best of
people when they care about each other.

1646
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,400
Which is why evil
will always have the edge.

1647
01:44:08,876 --> 01:44:12,505
You good guys are always
so bound by the rules.

1648
01:44:19,453 --> 01:44:22,047
You see, I kill my own men.

1649
01:44:28,496 --> 01:44:30,430
And lucky me.

1650
01:44:30,965 --> 01:44:32,899
I get the girl.

1651
01:44:33,868 --> 01:44:36,064
No!

1652
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:07,566
Don't worry. It will all
be over so very quickly.

1653
01:45:12,006 --> 01:45:13,339
What are you doing?

1654
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:16,009
They must have ripped the "Q"
section out of my dictionary,

1655
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:19,275
'cause I don't know the
meaning of the word "quit. "

1656
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:36,255
You want
a little fisticuffs? Okay.

1657
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:41,628
Get him, Roy.

1658
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,536
Come on, Roy!

1659
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:04,324
It's the funkyskunkulator!

1660
01:46:04,325 --> 01:46:05,458
We've got to stop it.

1661
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,052
Don't touch any toggles.

1662
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:11,357
Rage taking over.

1663
01:46:11,498 --> 01:46:13,933
Ja. We've heard
all that before.

1664
01:46:15,569 --> 01:46:16,969
No, no.

1665
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,730
Rage really taking over.

1666
01:47:10,357 --> 01:47:13,156
Frak-you later, Frankenpuss.

1667
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:21,995
Yeah!

1668
01:47:40,587 --> 01:47:42,146
Get out of here.

1669
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:49,122
Hit the deck.

1670
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:55,026
How do we shut
this thing down?

1671
01:47:56,003 --> 01:47:58,237
Group hug!

1672
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:00,036
Yeah! Okay!
Yeah!

1673
01:48:05,913 --> 01:48:07,013
Hurry up!

1674
01:48:07,014 --> 01:48:08,846
Get her closer to the hole!

1675
01:48:12,286 --> 01:48:14,948
Dad, this is the way
it has to be.

1676
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:18,657
The upshot is you won't be killed
because you're already dead.

1677
01:48:18,859 --> 01:48:20,693
No, I'm not going with you.

1678
01:48:20,694 --> 01:48:24,597
If there's a time for separation,
let me tell you something, this is it.

1679
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:25,732
Lift me up.

1680
01:48:25,733 --> 01:48:26,799
Push her up.

1681
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,769
Help me lift her up.
Help her.

1682
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:33,502
You can do it. Hold on.

1683
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:38,244
Do it!

1684
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:39,406
I love you, Dad!

1685
01:48:50,157 --> 01:48:52,225
Run! Run!

1686
01:48:52,226 --> 01:48:53,489
Let's get out of here!

1687
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:55,721
Run for your lives!

1688
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:01,299
Run!

1689
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:11,000
Go!

1690
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:21,481
Go! Go!

1691
01:49:33,834 --> 01:49:36,636
No one could survive the chaos
we've just witnessed here.

1692
01:49:36,637 --> 01:49:40,630
But as the dust begins to settle over
the ruins of the Casanova's mansion,

1693
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:43,009
the question remains.

1694
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:47,072
Who were these brave heroes that gave
their lives to save our city tonight?

1695
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:50,283
Did that frakulator work, or
what? What's the deal there?

1696
01:49:50,284 --> 01:49:52,618
Look. Something's moving.
People are coming out.

1697
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:54,520
Could you tell us
what's going on?

1698
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:56,055
Hi. Excuse me.

1699
01:49:56,056 --> 01:49:59,026
Can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

1700
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:00,860
We did it.
We won.

1701
01:50:00,861 --> 01:50:02,056
Hey, that's my team.

1702
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:05,793
We struck down evil with
the mighty sword of teamwork

1703
01:50:06,033 --> 01:50:07,633
and the hammer
of not-bickering.

1704
01:50:07,634 --> 01:50:10,970
We are number one. All others
are number two or lower.

1705
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:12,370
Who are you guys?

1706
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:14,407
They call me the Shoveler.

1707
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:16,843
That's my dad.

1708
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:19,579
My hero.
I'm the Bowler.

1709
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:20,706
Hello.

1710
01:50:23,484 --> 01:50:26,586
Blue Raja,
master of silverware. Hi, Mom.

1711
01:50:26,587 --> 01:50:29,454
I mean, cheerio, Mummy.

1712
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:31,324
Jeffrey.

1713
01:50:31,325 --> 01:50:32,492
And you, sir.

1714
01:50:32,493 --> 01:50:34,760
What's your name
and your superpower?

1715
01:50:34,761 --> 01:50:35,751
My name's Roy.

1716
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:39,599
I'm in a super amount of pain right
now. Could you please leave me alone?

1717
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:44,103
His name's Mr. Furious, and his
power comes from his boundless rage.

1718
01:50:44,104 --> 01:50:48,074
Excuse me. Could I say something? I
think we would all like this victory

1719
01:50:48,075 --> 01:50:50,209
to go out to
all the other guys.

1720
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:52,912
I'm talking about the people in this
city who are super good at their jobs

1721
01:50:52,913 --> 01:50:56,182
but never get any credit,
like the lady in the D.M.V.

1722
01:50:56,183 --> 01:50:57,483
That's a rough job.

1723
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,684
To the people
that remember jingles

1724
01:50:58,685 --> 01:51:00,686
from tons of old commercials.

1725
01:51:00,687 --> 01:51:03,389
And people that support local
music and seek out independent film.

1726
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:06,692
And the guy that drives the snow
plow. And the school nurse...

1727
01:51:06,693 --> 01:51:08,594
Eddie, Eddie,
I think they got the point.

1728
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:10,463
What's the name of this group?

1729
01:51:10,464 --> 01:51:11,731
The Super Dudes.

1730
01:51:11,732 --> 01:51:13,432
No, not the Super Dudes.

1731
01:51:13,433 --> 01:51:16,769
We don't have a name yet, but
definitely not the Super Dudes.

1732
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:18,571
I gotta get home.
It's late.

1733
01:51:18,572 --> 01:51:20,802
Picture, picture time.

Whatever you call them, Champion City
will forever owe a debt of gratitude

1735
01:51:27,447 --> 01:51:29,439
to these mystery men.

1736
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:34,610
Wait. That's it.
We are the Super Squad.

1737
01:51:35,055 --> 01:51:39,993
No! Alliteration in
these situations is corny.

1738
01:51:40,627 --> 01:51:44,597
What? Yes, we're all very
aware that you saved the day,

1739
01:51:44,598 --> 01:51:48,626
and I'm sure we'll be hearing
about it for the rest of our lives.
