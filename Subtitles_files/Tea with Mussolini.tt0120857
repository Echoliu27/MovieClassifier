1
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:28,192
- Excuse me, are you the consul?
- Yes.

2
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,252
Connie Raynor
of the Morning Post.

3
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,130
I'm fascinated to know what
His Majesty's Consul makes of it all.

4
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:37,034
I can't believe your readers will be
interested in our little ceremony.

5
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:40,834
Oh, they are. Since Mussolini,
we can't get enough of Italy.

6
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:43,341
Is this a regular group?
I mean, are they all friends?

7
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,777
Friends? The Italians
call them the Scorpioni.

8
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:50,681
- " Scorpioni"? Why?
- Why? Because they bite.

9
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,775
Not me. They tried,
but I bite back.

10
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:57,449
Your Lady Hester seems
a formidable old battle-ax.

11
00:02:57,524 --> 00:03:01,483
Ah, we live in an age
of great dictators.

12
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,972
- We are here today...
- Come!

13
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:24,278
to remember you...

14
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:27,184
Elizabeth Barrett Browning...

15
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:29,154
a true English lady...

16
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,383
who, with her poet husband,
Robert Browning...

17
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:35,554
found true happiness
in this glorious city of Florence..

18
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:38,462
thus celebrating the marriage
between our two great countries...

19
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:39,999
England and Italy.

20
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,827
My late husband,
the ambassador...

21
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:46,372
I wondered when we'd get
to her late husband.

22
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,001
always dreamt that England and Italy
would help form a united Europe.

23
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:54,740
- Mary seems to have a child with her.
- The dressmaker's child.

24
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:01,548
So we pay tribute to you,
dear Elizabeth...

25
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,021
who brought to this country
not only poetry...

26
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,116
but a fine example
of British motherhood.

27
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,389
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Please.

28
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:13,261
I'm sorry, Mary,
we had to start without you.

29
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:18,133
Arabella, your turn.
Veronica, please.

30
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:35,815
From English blood and Tuscan birth...

31
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,720
what country should we give her?

32
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:43,090
Instead of any on the earth,
the civic heavens receive her.

33
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:46,826
While the blue Tuscan sky
assumes-

34
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:54,701
While the blue Tuscan sky
entombs...

35
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:57,572
our English words of prayer.

36
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:07,978
Thank you, Arabella.
Thank you.

37
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:17,694
" Caro Signor Keegan.

38
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:22,599
Most respected
and famoso mercante di Manchester. "

39
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,728
" Dear sir. "

40
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:30,606
" I am in grande gratitudine
for the massive...

41
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:35,047
and importante...

42
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,912
bundle of silk...

43
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:40,043
which will bring-
which will bring...

44
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,114
lagrime allegre to the eyes
of molte bellissime...

45
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,887
Signore Florentine. "

46
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:50,429
" Thank you for the consignment
of fabric.

47
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:53,261
It is up to
your usual standard. "

48
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:57,827
" Please accept, signore,
my most humble compliments...

49
00:05:57,904 --> 00:06:00,304
and sincerissimi good wishes. "

50
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,364
" Yours sincerely-"

51
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,305
Ah, Miss Wallace,
that's all for today.

52
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,540
No, it isn't.

53
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:12,551
- What?
- Your son.

54
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,986
My son? He is
at the orphanage school. Why?

55
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:17,751
No, he isn't.

56
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:21,316
He ran away
to find his mother.

57
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:24,488
- That's the orphanage's business.
- You brought him into the world.

58
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:28,898
- You are responsible for him.
- Of course. I pay for his education.

59
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:32,927
And I still pay you to turn him
into a perfect British gentleman...

60
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:35,201
who'll speak better English
than mine.

61
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:37,209
What more can I do?

62
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:40,440
- Give him a home.
- Home?

63
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:43,038
The child will run away again.
I'm sure of it.

64
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:48,486
He's convinced his mother
will come back soon.

65
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,484
- Why don't you take him with you then?
- What?

66
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,495
I have been thinking about it
for some time.

67
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:01,030
He likes you.
He's happy with you, Miss Wallace.

68
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,704
You must take him with you
into your family.

69
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:10,065
- Well, you are his father.
- Of course I'm father.

70
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,441
Then try to persuade your wife.

71
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:15,413
Might do her good
to have a child to look after.

72
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:23,080
Can you imagine that my wife accept
a bastard in our house?

73
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:25,249
- My wife?
- Signor Guarnieri...

74
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:28,192
there are no illegitimate
children in this world...

75
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:30,752
only illegitimate parents.

76
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,264
Good boy. There.

77
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:40,773
- Say good morning to your father.
- Good morning.

78
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:48,077
You bring the child here?

79
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:51,311
The wife that can arrive any moment.

80
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,917
Miss Wallace, in England,
such behavior, it's perhaps possible.

81
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:02,792
But in Italy, believe me,
this is the end of the world.

82
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:05,729
Bring him back to the orphanage, subito,
or bring him to live with you...

83
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,528
or do what you want.

84
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,966
It's a responsibility
I cannot assume.

85
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,970
If you're married,
if you know what is love...

86
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:14,768
you understand certain situations
very, very delicate.

87
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,643
But you haven't answered
my question. What are we-

88
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:34,718
A lady has brought back
the child who ran away.

89
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:22,594
Luca, would you get the knives
and forks? You know where they are.

90
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,798
Oh, and the napkins, please.

91
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:34,846
Thank you. And glasses.

92
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,250
Who are they?

93
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:45,257
They're English soldiers.

94
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:51,327
- Is he your brother?
- No, Luca, I don't have a brother.

95
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:54,298
No, his name's Danny.

96
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:57,029
He's the young man
I was going to marry.

97
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,738
And that's my father.

98
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:03,742
They both went to fight
in the Great War...

99
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,835
and they didn't come back.

100
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:09,643
But they're always with me.
Now you get your chair.

101
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,186
There.

102
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:20,486
Haven't you ever had
bacon and eggs before?

103
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,130
Go on. Try it.
It's very good.

104
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:42,678
Can I stay here with you...

105
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,683
until my mother comes back?

106
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,349
Yes.

107
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:58,630
Just as long as you'd like.

108
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,833
Oh, the man is impossible.

109
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,669
- What did he say?
- It's no good.

110
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,836
He simply won't listen.

111
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:15,278
- It seems it's up to me.
- We'll all help you.

112
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:19,148
Well, it's my problem,
but you can all help if you will.

113
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:20,845
- Oh, of course.
- Of course we will.

114
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,323
Arabella- Wednesday and Friday.
Could you do the art bit?

115
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:28,485
- You know, music, galleries.
- Yes, yes, fine. What else?

116
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:32,520
Well, fetch him from school
when I can't. And mealtimes.

117
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:35,533
- Molly?
- I know. Arabella does the Uffizi...

118
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:38,035
and I do the supper
three times a week.

119
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:41,471
- All right. Do you mind terribly?
- I might rather enjoy it.

120
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,904
I don't like this coughing.
She's been doing it all night.

121
00:12:46,979 --> 00:12:48,970
Perhaps I should take her
to the vet.

122
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:54,176
- What was I saying?
- About art.

123
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:58,314
Italians breathe it in with the air
of Florence. Not like us cold English.

124
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:02,259
- Are you cold?
- Not me, Luca.

125
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:05,422
I have drunk deep
the wine of Firenze.

126
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:10,561
I've warmed both hands before the fires
of Botticelli and Michelangelo.

127
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:13,503
- Is she coughing again?
- Is she cold too?

128
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:16,098
Come on, come on.
We'll be late.

129
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:24,208
We've got to see this.

130
00:13:24,283 --> 00:13:27,116
We've just got time before school,
but this is something you mustn't miss.

131
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:29,245
I'll show you something
you will never forget.

132
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,119
You see, Luca...

133
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:38,425
Florence isn't just shiny cars
and ice creams, as little boys think.

134
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:42,764
It's the human form divine,
the body beautiful.

135
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,465
And you- yes, you-
could be part of that world.

136
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,507
To make, to create...

137
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:52,305
to live
as those old artists did, Luca...

138
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:56,405
is to share a part
in the divine plan.

139
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:03,321
We must go. We're
going to be late for school.

140
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:19,900
Now, I'll be back later to
take you home. I must run to the vet.

141
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:23,499
Oh, well done, old girl.
You've done terribly well.

142
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,625
Come here.

143
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:26,034
Come here, I'm telling you.

144
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:36,444
You're right to be afraid of me.
I'll get you.

145
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:43,083
You'll tell your wife to leave the
child alone, or I'll call the police!

146
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:46,124
My wife's had a lot
to put up with.

147
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:48,626
What do you expect me
to do, lock her up?

148
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:54,291
Yes, if necessary. Will you please try
to understand what I'm telling you?

149
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,464
I might agree to look after Luca
on certain conditions.

150
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:02,803
As far as he's concerned,
you might not even exist.

151
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,675
Just give him some of the
valuable time you spend on your cloth...

152
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:08,304
and all the rest.

153
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:12,775
The child needs a father,
for God's sake!

154
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:17,052
Five lire-

155
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,455
in silver, eh-
for your pocket.

156
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,352
Grazie, Signor Guarnieri.

157
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,260
English. In English.

158
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:30,325
- Thank you, Mr. Guarnieri.
- That is better.

159
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,337
But why you not
call me Papa?

160
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:33,838
Because-

161
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,942
Because what?

162
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,674
Because you don't take me
to school on a bicycle.

163
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,852
Well, Miss Wallace takes you.

164
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,194
When is she coming back?

165
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:08,869
I don't know.
She's busy, you know.

166
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,637
In Paris. For her work.

167
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,413
Ah, bene.
She is there.

168
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,752
Luca, stop!

169
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,590
Luca, come back!

170
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,241
Luca, get in.

171
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:53,908
I'll see you next Sunday.

172
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:14,639
I thought my mother
had come back.

173
00:18:18,477 --> 00:18:21,207
She will not be coming back.

174
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,182
I don't understand.

175
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:26,540
Why?

176
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:32,981
Do you remember the two photographs
you saw in my room?

177
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:38,086
Your soldiers
that didn't come back.

178
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:40,155
Yes.

179
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:44,601
But they're always with me,
even though they're not here.

180
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,532
Love doesn't die.

181
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:53,544
And in the same way, your mother
will always be with you...

182
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:56,445
even though she's-

183
00:18:56,515 --> 00:18:58,107
Not here.

184
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,511
It's supposed to be
around here somewhere.

185
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:35,845
Excuse me.

186
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:44,023
Can you tell me where
a Signora Georgina Rockwell is?

187
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:47,293
You mean Georgie?
She's over there.

188
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,300
Thanks a million, kid.

189
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:52,098
Grandmama, do we really
need a tablecloth?

190
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,662
- Of course we do, Wilfred.
- But it always blows away.

191
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,107
Then find some little stones
and put them on the corners.

192
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:03,076
He really is quite charming,
Lady Hester, your grandson.

193
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:07,107
Poor boy. He lost his father
at Passchendaele.

194
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:10,883
And his mother was never very strong.
I've had to be father and mother to him.

195
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:14,483
- You've done a marvelous job.
- Thank you.

196
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:23,594
Don't I remember that
particularly ostentatious vehicle?

197
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:28,838
- Oh, no, it can't be.
- I think so.

198
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:32,969
Mrs. Morganthall is back.
Should we invite her to tea?

199
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,910
I think not.

200
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:38,381
Americans simply don't
understand picnics.

201
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,885
Georgie!

202
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:46,518
- Hey, Georgie!
- Elsa.

203
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,863
- Where in the hell have you been?
- Oh, sweetheart...

204
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:54,729
why do you have to do your digging
in these dusty, dirty places?

205
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,236
Oh, the American collectors
are back in Italy.

206
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,363
That's where
all the bargains are now.

207
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,339
And plenty of fakes as well.

208
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:05,536
You put your fofo in
You take your fofo out

209
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,169
Americans.

210
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,677
You know Cesare Poggi,
the art dealer, don't you?

211
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,776
Okay, well, he telephoned me
in Paris to-

212
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:18,289
Oh, my God, it was so hot there, you
could have fried an egg on the sidewalk.

213
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:20,188
- Hold that for me.
- And Cesare said-

214
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:22,420
He said he'd just found
the first version...

215
00:21:22,494 --> 00:21:24,689
of Picasso's
Desmoiselles d'Avignon.

216
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:26,697
- And you bought it?
- Well, of course, I-

217
00:21:26,765 --> 00:21:29,563
Connie Raynor of the Morning Post
in London. You mind if I take notes?

218
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:31,432
- No.
- Yes, we-

219
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,562
No, I want everyone
to hear about this.

220
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:36,233
Anyway, when he called,
I said " yes" immediately...

221
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:38,936
but that penny-pinching son-of-a-bitch
husband of mine said " no"...

222
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,104
pitched a fit
and then faked a heart attack.

223
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,375
But I say good riddance
to bad rubbish.

224
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:47,180
- No, she really does not mean-
- Oh, I really do. I really do.

225
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:49,345
What I can't get over
is that he's too cheap...

226
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,912
to slip a poor girl
a little Picasso.

227
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,424
- Hard to believe.
- I know.

228
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:56,154
- Maybe you could sell this and buy it.
- No, I couldn't.

229
00:21:56,228 --> 00:21:59,129
I want to keep this one, thank you
very much. But mark my words...

230
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:01,257
I'm gonna have that goddamn painting
if it's the last thing I do.

231
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,563
And she will, believe me.

232
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:06,764
It was very sweet of you to point me
in the right direction. Here.

233
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:18,982
My God, look at you!

234
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:23,545
You have sprung up like a little bean
sprout since the last time I saw you.

235
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,954
Oh, my goodness,
look at you!

236
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:29,324
Now, you tell your mother that I'm going
to need a completely new wardrobe...

237
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:31,693
so I plan to keep her
as busy as a little beaver.

238
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:35,222
She's really better than anyone else.
Better than Schiapparelli-

239
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,825
- Elsa.
- What?

240
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:42,067
There was no chance
to tell you, but Clara's dead.

241
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:48,108
- My God, Georgie.
- Nothing to be done. Just-

242
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,648
But what about the boy?

243
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:59,690
One of the English women, Mary Wallace,
has been looking after him.

244
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,426
Will you tell this Mary Wallace
that I want to talk with her?

245
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,514
It's too bad. Now go away.

246
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,516
Please, go away.

247
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:32,219
- Prego, m'lady.
- Oh! Thank you.

248
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:44,502
- Could I take a photograph?
- Oh, yes.

249
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,039
Look, everybody knows
how I live my life.

250
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:53,511
I live my life like a crazy woman,
but I loved Clara.

251
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,513
We had this
strange relationship.

252
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:58,345
She didn't even bill me sometimes,
but that's beside the point.

253
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:02,478
And I know what kind of a hard time
Luca's father gave her.

254
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:05,921
- I'm sure he's not even helping you.
- Sometimes.

255
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:07,925
I'm sure you're being too kind.

256
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:12,521
Anyway, I know that I owe her a lot
of money, and I was thinking that...

257
00:24:12,598 --> 00:24:16,557
possibly, I would put the money
into a trust for Luca...

258
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,865
and I wanna know
what you think about that.

259
00:24:22,474 --> 00:24:26,535
It would make all the difference
to his life.

260
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:30,207
Well, it's not a lot of money,
you know. It's just enough to give him-

261
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:32,273
- Independence.
- Yes.

262
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,177
Thank you.

263
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,751
Oh, do look. Oh, look.

264
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:47,492
Look at that ridiculous American
monstrosity they've given the child.

265
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,330
What do they call them?

266
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,836
Knickerbocker Glories.

267
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:56,102
It's amazing, you know.
They can even vulgarize ice cream.

268
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:59,269
Don't worry.
We're all taking care of him.

269
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:02,138
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

270
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,148
It's one thing
to take care of stray dogs.

271
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:07,208
It's quite another
to take care of stray boys.

272
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:11,949
Elsa, darling!

273
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:14,151
Don't give me that " Elsa, darling" crap.

274
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:17,218
- Now where's my goddamn Picasso?
- If you'd sent the money when I-

275
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:21,289
I told you that Morganthall wouldn't
give me the money then, Cesee.

276
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:25,029
Goddamn it. What? Buy it back.
Offer them more money.

277
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:27,128
- No, Elsa, please.
- I want it now.

278
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:30,107
Georgie, do you understand
what I'm saying?

279
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:33,770
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

280
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:37,907
Okay, Elsa, I try for you.
Okay? I promise.

281
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:40,144
I don't want you to try.
I want you to get it.

282
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:42,949
Yes, I will get it.
Okay?

283
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:45,512
Is that an Italian " get it"
or an American " get it"?

284
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:48,059
I will get it for you, okay?

285
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:53,388
I'm sorry I got mad at you.
I love you.

286
00:25:53,465 --> 00:25:55,456
- I love you too.
- Thank you, thank you.

287
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,462
I just love this painting
so much.

288
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:01,131
I know, I know.
Oh, I'm sorry, Elsa.

289
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:04,505
My back.
I had some problem for two days.

290
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:07,568
I think you prefer to dance with
these young people. They drove me here.

291
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:09,170
This is Fabio, the pianist.

292
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:11,239
- This is Carlo. This is Fabrizio.
- How do you do?

293
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:14,649
Come on, Fabrizio.
You dance with me.

294
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,847
Oh, Cesee,
thank you so much.

295
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:19,186
I think it's better for you
to dance with them.

296
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:21,852
Well, you don't
have to twist my arm.

297
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:25,124
Come on, Fabrizio.
I choose you.

298
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:31,633
That's my girl.

299
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:35,434
Now here's a dancer,
could dance the feet off you boys.

300
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:40,533
" Bellissima. " I know that's good,
but what is it? What am I doing good?

301
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:44,275
- You dance very well.
- Thank you. Yes, of course, I do.

302
00:26:44,349 --> 00:26:47,375
You should have seen her
on Broadway.

303
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:51,183
Elsa Paris-
Ziegfeld star.

304
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:55,192
Three years running, until she
threw it up for Mr. Morganthall.

305
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,423
He wanted
a private performance.

306
00:26:58,497 --> 00:27:00,761
And, boy, has he been paying
for it ever since.

307
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:07,199
Bernard, we need
some more champagne.

308
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:11,740
You're not gonna
need that, Connie.

309
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,337
When laughing friends deride

310
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:19,214
Tears I cannot hide

311
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:26,217
And I just smile and say

312
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:30,728
When a lovely flame dies

313
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:39,334
Smoke gets in your eyes

314
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:45,440
Are all American women
as exciting as you?

315
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,070
Alas, no.

316
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:51,445
Go, go, you have it!
Come on, Luca! Dribble, dribble!

317
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,347
No, Luca,
to your left, to your left.

318
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:56,410
No, Luca,
pass it to your left!

319
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:59,184
Shoot! Yeah! Luca! Yeah! Goal!

320
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:01,487
Goal!

321
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:08,331
We win!

322
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,096
Luca, yeah!

323
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:13,967
You are the best, Luca!

324
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:18,039
It's Mussolini's
finest achievement-

325
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,305
discipline, order,
safety in the streets.

326
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,313
And invaded Abyssinia.

327
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,474
Well, why shouldn't Mussolini
have an empire?

328
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:26,483
All the best people in Europe
have empires.

329
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:28,041
- May I quote you?
- Yes, you may.

330
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,578
Tell them in England
the truth about Mussolini.

331
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:36,525
Such a vibrant man-
a Roman emperor.

332
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:39,155
Welcome back. It is
so lovely to see you again.

333
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,929
John!

334
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:52,169
What do you think
of our new Augustus of Italy?

335
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:56,738
Musso? Ooh? I think his butt's
too big to push around the dance floor.

336
00:28:58,517 --> 00:28:59,677
Oh, dreadful.

337
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:05,548
Why, Hester,
I didn't see you there. Luciano!

338
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:11,125
Elsa, my dear.

339
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,123
Flagrantly immoral.

340
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:23,269
I'm throwing this little shindig tonight
to say good-bye and thank you...

341
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:26,540
'cause, alas, I have to
love you and leave you.

342
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:29,079
We'll have to be
terribly brave about that.

343
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:31,445
- Don't go. Florence needs you.
- Oh, Paolo, thank you so much.

344
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:34,952
But just for a little while,
because tomorrow Cesee and I...

345
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,820
are going to Paris where I got
the chance to buy a certain Picasso...

346
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,051
and get my skinflint husband
to pay for it.

347
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:48,299
But tonight, I want everybody to have
a wonderful time and drink up...

348
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,732
because the champagne's on me.

349
00:29:53,472 --> 00:29:55,497
For she's a jolly good fellow

350
00:29:55,574 --> 00:30:00,307
Oh, my goodness, that Doney's should
come to this. It's too much. Too much.

351
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:03,472
What did she say she wanted
to lay her hands on?

352
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:06,608
- A Picasso.
- Who's he?

353
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:09,813
He's a picture, dear.

354
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:12,448
Which nobody can deny

355
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:18,087
Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny

356
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:21,564
For she's a jolly good fellow

357
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:25,160
I'm Giulia Meyer,
a friend of Mrs. Morganthall.

358
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:28,604
- Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.
- Sit down, please.

359
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:33,576
Elsa wants you and your friends
to join us in the celebration.

360
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:36,944
- How very kind.
- Oh, do thank her.

361
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:42,644
I'd bathe in the stuff
to celebrate her departure.

362
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:45,952
Which nobody can deny

363
00:30:50,795 --> 00:30:54,891
You like this? This is okay.
It's a good copy, a Roman copy.

364
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:57,332
But this- Come.
I want you to see this.

365
00:30:57,402 --> 00:31:01,099
Ah, it's Hellenistic.
Authentic 150 B.C.

366
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:04,631
" Venere e Amore. "
"Venus and Eros. "

367
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:22,219
That's very good, Luca.

368
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,888
For seven,
that's excellent.

369
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:28,057
It's much better
than a lot of amateur artists.

370
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:30,863
Where did you learn to do that?

371
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:34,736
We'll start again from
the middle of the balcony scene...

372
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:37,741
where Juliet is on the balcony...

373
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:41,768
and Romeo is down below.

374
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:46,044
Let's put the light
back on the stage.

375
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:52,384
There.

376
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:56,388
Now-

377
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:01,860
" Lady, by yonder
blessed moon I swear.

378
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,959
That tips with splendor
all these fruit-tree tops. "

379
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:08,802
" Oh, swear not by the moon,
the inconstant moon...

380
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:12,502
that monthly changes
in her circled orbit...

381
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:17,014
lest that of thy love
prove likewise variable. "

382
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:21,651
- What does that mean?
- " Variable"?

383
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,314
Changeable, changing.

384
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:26,789
Things that don't always
stay the same.

385
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:29,190
I see- vario.

386
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:32,389
Yes. " Vario. "

387
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:36,901
And Juliet knows that
true love is not vario.

388
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:41,132
It lasts forever.
It's the most important thing in life.

389
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:45,233
- Now it's Romeo's turn.
- " What shall I swear by?"

390
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:50,338
" Do not swear at all.
Or, if thou wilt...

391
00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:53,680
swear by thy gracious self...

392
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:58,086
which is the god of my idolatry,
and I'll believe thee. "

393
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:01,284
Now he comes up to the balcony.

394
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:10,599
Now let's go back
to the beginning again.

395
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:29,745
Oh, my God!

396
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:37,987
Wilfred, where do you think
you're going?

397
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:47,030
- Wilfred, come and sit down.
- Grandmama, this man is hurt!

398
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:49,767
The world's gone mad.

399
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:53,106
Damn Fascists!
Shame on you! Shame on you!

400
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,908
This isn't the Fascists.

401
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,414
This is the anarchists.

402
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:02,249
Mussolini has no idea
what is being done here.

403
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,313
If my husband were alive,
he would go to Rome and tell him.

404
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:10,059
Perhaps I should take on
the role of ex-ambassador...

405
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:13,893
and go to Rome myself.

406
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,299
Is she serious
about seeing Mussolini?

407
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:27,402
There's no doubt she'll try.
Happily, she won't succeed.

408
00:34:28,713 --> 00:34:30,647
But I might be able to swing it...

409
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:32,740
journalist on an important
British paper.

410
00:34:32,817 --> 00:34:37,015
Please, Miss Raynor,
leave diplomacy...

411
00:34:37,088 --> 00:34:39,022
to the diplomats.

412
00:34:52,504 --> 00:34:55,905
One is the widow
of Sir Hector Random...

413
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:58,442
the British Ambassador
from 1926 to 1929...

414
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,444
as you will undoubtedly remember.

415
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:03,777
The other is a reporter
from the Morning Post.

416
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:07,784
I think it's about
what's happening in Florence.

417
00:35:07,852 --> 00:35:11,379
We must admit
it was a dangerous mistake.

418
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:14,516
I think it's in our interest
to reassure them.

419
00:35:14,592 --> 00:35:17,857
It seems they're
very influential in England.

420
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:30,906
Connie, don't forget
we've come to Rome...

421
00:35:30,975 --> 00:35:33,307
to take part in a moment of history.

422
00:35:36,548 --> 00:35:39,142
I remember your husband
very well.

423
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:41,310
- A true gentleman.
- Indeed.

424
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:53,930
Lady Hester Random.

425
00:35:56,468 --> 00:35:59,369
- Please.
- Her grandson, Wilfred Random.

426
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:01,794
Sit down.

427
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:06,443
Miss Constance Raynor
of the Morning Post.

428
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:08,809
- Welcome.
- Please.

429
00:36:12,984 --> 00:36:15,452
Dear ladies and gentleman...

430
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:18,486
Count Grandi tells me
you have some fears...

431
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:22,686
about your position here in Italy?

432
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,990
To speak truth,
we have been a little nervous.

433
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:27,463
Have no fears.

434
00:36:31,736 --> 00:36:34,569
I always knew
we could rely on you.

435
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,700
Our long personal relationship
since that night...

436
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:40,539
with my late husband
at La Scala, Milan.

437
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:43,046
You don't mind if I take notes?

438
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:45,173
You are here for that reason,
are you not?

439
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,184
Throughout our glorious history...

440
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:49,311
we have received your poets.

441
00:36:50,722 --> 00:36:54,021
I have particular regard
for Lord Byron...

442
00:36:54,092 --> 00:36:56,026
the great Lord Byron.

443
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:00,326
So many of you came here,
that at one time...

444
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:03,959
the Italian word for foreigner
was " Inglese. "

445
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:10,772
As I was saying,
you have nothing to fear.

446
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:13,606
Whatever happens...

447
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:17,610
you will be always...

448
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:22,585
under my personal protection.

449
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:28,619
You have my word.

450
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:35,497
Oh, oh, look.

451
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:50,240
Shall I be mother?

452
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:53,945
Shall I pour?

453
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,651
What is it?
What is it?

454
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:08,865
Look, in the paper.

455
00:38:08,933 --> 00:38:13,802
Good heavens. It's Lady Hester
and himself. They did it.

456
00:38:13,871 --> 00:38:16,772
- They had tea with-
- Mussolini!

457
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:21,005
Careful.

458
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:29,653
No food or drink
allowed in the Uffizi anymore.

459
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:33,179
- We always make tea here.
- There is a change of policy.

460
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:35,282
Go and drink your tea
in one of your colonies.

461
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,453
This is a free
and civilized country.

462
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,115
No, no, not that one!
Please!

463
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:08,858
How can you
let them do that?

464
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:23,566
Nickie, Nickie!

465
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:30,309
Let me kill him!

466
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:33,908
Wait for me!

467
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:37,318
I've seen what
is happening here.

468
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:42,183
You're afraid to have
an Englishwoman working for you...

469
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,388
in case the Fascists
break up your shop.

470
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:49,326
I quite understand.

471
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,527
I won't be coming back.

472
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:53,869
I'm sorry.

473
00:39:57,075 --> 00:40:00,511
It is not just the letters.
It's the boy.

474
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:05,344
He's doing very well
at school.

475
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:07,350
His English is first-class.

476
00:40:07,418 --> 00:40:10,387
English is no longer
the language of tomorrow.

477
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,651
Luca must learn German.

478
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:18,127
I'll send him to school
in Austria.

479
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:21,427
- Austria?
- Our future is with Germany.

480
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:40,483
I'm afraid, Miss Wallace...

481
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:44,009
the era of England-
it's finished.

482
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:50,722
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

483
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:55,966
Now, set the teeth...

484
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,967
and stretch the nostrils wide.

485
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:01,903
Hold hard the breath. And bend up
every spirit to his full height.

486
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:05,431
On, on, you noblest Luca.

487
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,445
- Who said that?
- Shakespeare's King Henry.

488
00:41:08,513 --> 00:41:11,038
Remember, before the battle?

489
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:16,178
- He didn't say " Luca. "
- No, he didn't. You're quite right.

490
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:20,122
He said " English," but he was
talking about people who are brave...

491
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:22,455
like you.

492
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:30,766
Case.

493
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,298
Austria is so beautiful.

494
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:38,740
Snowy mountains, blue skies.
I wish I could come with you.

495
00:41:41,012 --> 00:41:44,311
You're not supposed
to do that.

496
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,777
Bye, Luca.

497
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:52,554
Look, I brought you some flowers.
Say good-bye to Nickie.

498
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:59,129
Your favorite biscuits.
Take care.

499
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:14,608
" And gentlemen in England
now abed...

500
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,842
Shall think themselves accursed
they were not here...

501
00:42:17,915 --> 00:42:21,681
and hold their manhoods cheap
whilst any speak...

502
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:26,314
that fought with us
upon Saint Crispin's Day.

503
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,483
Upon Saint Crispin's Day!"

504
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:31,782
Ladies, please, please.

505
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:33,983
Ladies, ladies, please.

506
00:43:35,426 --> 00:43:40,523
If I have told you once,
I have told you a hundred times:

507
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:43,567
You have got to go back
to England.

508
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:45,568
It's becoming dangerous here.

509
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:48,571
It's much more dangerous
in England. They're at war.

510
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,575
Why should we change our lives simply
because some idiots want to make war?

511
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:54,736
The war can't last
more than two weeks.

512
00:43:54,812 --> 00:43:57,542
I mean, aren't the Germans in Paris?
It's all over in France.

513
00:43:57,615 --> 00:44:00,140
For some people,
it's just beginning-

514
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:02,151
the Jews, for instance.

515
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:06,246
Thousands of them being
rounded up and taken away.

516
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:09,191
Everybody's talking about the Jews.

517
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,286
You don't believe every bit
of pink propaganda...

518
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:14,297
you read in the newspapers, do you?

519
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:17,892
You can think what you will,
Lady Hester, but I must warn you...

520
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:20,767
that if Italy declares war...

521
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:23,306
we shall have to close down
the consulate.

522
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:27,743
I insist you all return to England.

523
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:33,648
But whatever for? Signor Mussolini is
wise enough to keep Italy out of it.

524
00:44:34,685 --> 00:44:36,448
- Besides...
- Well said.

525
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,650
I have his personal assurance
that we will not be involved in any way.

526
00:44:40,725 --> 00:44:43,250
Yes, that's all
very well for you ladies.

527
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:47,889
What about this young man?
Do you want him to become a deserter?

528
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,291
Wilfred will always do
the right thing.

529
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:58,339
Anna, Anna, yes,
some more tea cakes, please.

530
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,450
Nothing has changed here.

531
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:45,053
How many memories.

532
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,257
Where's Mary?

533
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:49,383
Miss Wallace?

534
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,793
We haven't seen her for some time.

535
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:56,390
She had no more work
and went to stay with a friend.

536
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:58,435
Which friend?

537
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:02,131
I don't know.
She didn't leave an address.

538
00:46:02,206 --> 00:46:05,073
She must be
with some other English people.

539
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:07,401
She's still in Florence?

540
00:46:07,478 --> 00:46:10,538
I don't know. Nobody's seen her.

541
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,809
John Webster!

542
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:20,414
No, no, three cases. Three.

543
00:46:21,992 --> 00:46:24,586
- Please, are you English?
- Yes.

544
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:28,189
I'm looking for someone.
Mary Wallace. Do you know her?

545
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:30,756
- No, she-
- We must get a move on.

546
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:33,133
I can see Witham.
He's getting everyone on board.

547
00:46:33,204 --> 00:46:36,867
- Is she with your group?
- No, she's one of the die-hards.

548
00:46:36,941 --> 00:46:39,466
She's up at Lady-

549
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:42,876
Hester's place, refusing to budge.

550
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,381
Sorry.

551
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:06,764
Witham! Witham!

552
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:11,033
What's going on here?
The English get bored with Florence...

553
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:13,303
now they're all heading back
for the excitement of Bournemouth?

554
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:14,935
It's the war.

555
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:17,037
- Italy's not in the war.
- Not yet.

556
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:20,311
Il Duce is waiting
to back the winner.

557
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:23,547
I'm not leaving.
I'm just arriving.

558
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:26,823
I'm American.

559
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:29,792
What about Lady Hester and the others?

560
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,455
They refuse to budge. They still think
Mussolini's going to look after them.

561
00:47:33,531 --> 00:47:36,193
Thank God. What would Florence be
without the " Scorpioni. "

562
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:39,430
- Let's hope the Florentines think so.
- It was lovely to see you.

563
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:41,198
Good-bye.

564
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:54,281
I have already been through
this documenti nonsense. Here.

565
00:47:57,521 --> 00:47:59,614
Elsa Strauss-Almerson.

566
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:03,216
Yes, thank you.
Is that good enough?

567
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,693
- And what happened to the last one?
- He kicked the bucket.

568
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:10,996
- And who is Strauss-Almerson?
- He is a lovely elderly gentleman.

569
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:13,002
Why doesn't that surprise me?

570
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,699
No, really, he is.
No, he's an absolute angel.

571
00:48:16,774 --> 00:48:18,708
Or he soon will be.

572
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:20,903
Signora Elsa!

573
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,408
I'm Luca-
Luca Innocenti.

574
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:30,146
Luca! My God, every time I see you,
you're taller and more grown-up.

575
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:33,622
- You're so handsome too.
- I don't think so.

576
00:48:33,691 --> 00:48:37,491
Oh, come on now. When a girl tells
you that, you've got to listen.

577
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:39,620
Otherwise you're gonna miss out
on a whole bunch of fun.

578
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:43,861
Let me fill you in on the girls. What
have you been up to? It's been so long.

579
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:47,097
I was sent away to school in Austria,
but I couldn't bear it any longer...

580
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,503
so I've come home to Florence
to the School of Art.

581
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:51,200
It's what I've always
wanted to do.

582
00:48:51,275 --> 00:48:55,041
I thought your father always wanted you
to be the perfect English gentleman.

583
00:48:55,112 --> 00:48:58,411
He changed his mind and tried to make me
the perfect German businessman.

584
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:01,417
- Bet it didn't take.
- It doesn't matter. I'm independent.

585
00:49:01,485 --> 00:49:04,511
- And I owe it all to you, signora.
- To me?

586
00:49:04,588 --> 00:49:07,523
- The money, Elsa. The trust.
- Oh, the trust.

587
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:09,559
But, Luca, that was
your mother's money.

588
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:11,561
Now, I'm gonna be here
for a very long time...

589
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:14,120
and I want you to come up and
tell me all about yourself, okay?

590
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,636
Elsa, darling, is not the moment.
Shall we go, please?

591
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:22,194
Luca, I have to go,
but I love you. Good-bye!

592
00:49:23,274 --> 00:49:26,334
- Why are you hurrying me so much?
- I tell you later.

593
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:30,005
This is Vittorio Fanfani. He is
a good lawyer and a good friend.

594
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,810
You know lawyers.
Better to be friends with them.

595
00:49:32,883 --> 00:49:35,477
- Cesee, where's my car?
- It's too big and flashy.

596
00:49:35,552 --> 00:49:37,520
I thought it would be
better to be discreet.

597
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:41,115
Cesare, I had no idea that driving
around in my car was indiscreet.

598
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:43,284
- Oh, Elsa, please.
- Well, of course, how would I know...

599
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,624
because I'm just
a rich, vulgar American.

600
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:49,496
Elsa, my angel, let's talk
about something pleasant.

601
00:49:49,566 --> 00:49:54,799
I have managed
to get the Picasso for you.

602
00:49:54,872 --> 00:49:57,773
- Are you happy?
- So happy, Cesee.

603
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:01,136
What a great coming-home present.

604
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:04,237
It's a very beautiful painting.

605
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:07,375
- You know something about modern art?
- Yes.

606
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:10,852
I like it very much,
especially the Italian-

607
00:50:10,921 --> 00:50:14,186
Marinetti, Balla, de Chirico.

608
00:50:15,526 --> 00:50:17,460
Beauty and brains.

609
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:21,555
So, you're a chauffeur
who's a lawyer...

610
00:50:21,632 --> 00:50:24,567
and an art expert
and speaks English.

611
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:27,570
Cesee, things have changed.

612
00:50:28,605 --> 00:50:31,438
So how is it that you speak
such perfect English?

613
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:35,410
My father. I spent some time with him
in America when he was working there.

614
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:37,413
Wonderful country.

615
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:40,245
Would you like to go back?

616
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:45,152
- If this war doesn't spoil everything.
- Exactly, Elsa.

617
00:50:45,222 --> 00:50:47,281
Would someone correct me if I'm wrong?

618
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:49,292
Am I living on a completely
different planet?

619
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,693
As far as I know, the United States
isn't at war with anybody.

620
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:54,788
Not yet, anyway.

621
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:58,092
Mister, I-

622
00:50:58,168 --> 00:51:00,466
Fanfani, Vittorio.

623
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:06,476
Vittorio, I was thinking that since
you're such a lover of modern art...

624
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:10,309
that it would be nice if you could come
up and help me when I hang my paintings.

625
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:15,182
I'd like that very much.
Cesare showed me some of your art.

626
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:18,050
- That Balla you have is my favorite.
- I know, it's mine too.

627
00:51:18,122 --> 00:51:19,419
- Really?
- Yes.

628
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,516
This conversation is making me
a little carsick.

629
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:03,561
- Are you ready? We have to go.
- Yes.

630
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:06,728
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I holding up the war?

631
00:52:06,804 --> 00:52:10,467
- Are we under arrest?
- He says we're being taken into custody.

632
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:12,475
Oh, really?

633
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:16,138
It will be nice to know
that when we're locked up...

634
00:52:16,213 --> 00:52:20,650
we won't be under arrest,
just " taken into custody. "

635
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:23,311
- And what will II Duce do?
- Il Duce?

636
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:27,050
Yes, II Duce. What will he do
when he hears that you've arrested me?

637
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:29,786
You see,
I am Lady Hester Random.

638
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:33,819
My late husband was
His Britannic Majesty's ambassador.

639
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:37,696
I have diplomatic immunity.

640
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:41,169
- More coffee, please. This is cold.
- Oh, Hester.

641
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:49,707
Anna, are you crazy?
You can't go with them.

642
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,304
Try to understand.

643
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,679
Lady Hester took care of me
when nobody else would.

644
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:54,842
I can't leave her now!

645
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:55,907
Listen to me!

646
00:52:55,986 --> 00:52:57,044
Leave me alone!

647
00:53:05,462 --> 00:53:07,692
What did he say?

648
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:12,258
- That we are enemy aliens.
- But we are not enemies.

649
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:14,497
We're not aliens, either.

650
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:18,132
We chose Florence from the whole world.
Florence should be honored!

651
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:23,170
For once I agree with you.
Hello, Mary.

652
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:41,123
- We'd better go, Hester.
- Better go?

653
00:53:41,198 --> 00:53:44,599
I'm sure Mussolini will
release you quite soon.

654
00:53:46,837 --> 00:53:49,032
Yes. I'd better go.

655
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:57,070
At least you can take
your maid to look after you.

656
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:02,244
And your niece,
to accompany you.

657
00:54:06,456 --> 00:54:09,857
Georgie, will you
take Lucy to the bus?

658
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:12,987
Oh, certainly.
Lucy, my dear.

659
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:18,061
Oh, you look lovely
in your traveling frock.

660
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:23,596
Oh, I'm very worried for you, with
all these Italian studs roaming around.

661
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:30,940
Come on. Up you go.

662
00:54:31,014 --> 00:54:33,812
You're gonna miss your trousers.
I never leave home without mine.

663
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:36,250
Though I must say, skirts
aren't all bad under the right...

664
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,844
situation.

665
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,490
- Hester, Hester, come on. Chin up.
- Oh, that's typically American.

666
00:54:47,564 --> 00:54:51,125
Keep out of trouble and tell
other people to keep their chins up.

667
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:54,432
Come on. You never know. I may be
joining you sooner than you think.

668
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:57,564
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

669
00:54:59,743 --> 00:55:01,768
Take care, old girl.

670
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:06,844
Oh, dear!
What a dreadful, tiny-

671
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,554
Oh! Oh, heavens!

672
00:55:11,622 --> 00:55:15,353
- I'm sorry.
- Miss Mary, it's me, Luca.

673
00:55:17,427 --> 00:55:21,830
It is you! Oh, my goodness,
I can't believe it!

674
00:55:21,898 --> 00:55:23,866
I heard what they were
doing to you.

675
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:32,807
I'm afraid it's " hello" and " good-bye"
all in the same breath. I-

676
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:35,777
I'll let you know
where we're going, if I can.

677
00:55:41,218 --> 00:55:45,279
You waited! You waited!
We came as quickly as we could.

678
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:54,697
We have to find room for these.
I can't go without my paints.

679
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:56,699
Here.

680
00:55:58,335 --> 00:56:00,826
Come on, Nickie.
Come quickly.

681
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:10,477
You won't take the dog!

682
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:13,846
Don't take her!
Please, don't take her!

683
00:56:13,984 --> 00:56:18,182
My dog!
I have to have-

684
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:25,219
Take the dog, please.
Look after her.

685
00:56:26,396 --> 00:56:29,263
Of course I will.
We were puppies together.

686
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:37,973
Bye!

687
00:57:55,485 --> 00:57:57,282
So that's where they're taking them...

688
00:57:57,354 --> 00:57:58,787
San Gimignano...

689
00:57:58,855 --> 00:58:01,983
the city of one hundred towers.

690
00:58:02,058 --> 00:58:04,822
Have you ever been there?

691
00:58:04,895 --> 00:58:07,728
There are some beautiful
frescoes by Ghirlandaio.

692
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:10,694
Beautiful.

693
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:13,565
That'll be a great comfort
for those wretched ladies.

694
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:49,137
Well, this can't be right.

695
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:51,366
This is a barracks!

696
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:53,534
It looks like an old school.

697
00:58:56,813 --> 00:58:58,804
Well, there must be a mistake.

698
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:03,547
It seems there's
only one lavatory.

699
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:08,787
We can't be expected to sleep together.
Are we to have no privacy?

700
00:59:08,859 --> 00:59:12,590
Now, if we have to be here,
we may as well make the best of it.

701
00:59:12,662 --> 00:59:16,598
So why don't you all choose
a bed and take your cases...

702
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:19,897
and we'll rig up some screens
for a bit of privacy.

703
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:34,880
Let's do a roll call before
the old ladies go to sleep.

704
00:59:45,128 --> 00:59:48,063
You are extremely rude,
young man!

705
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:52,727
No gentleman would dream of entering
a lady's room without first knocking.

706
00:59:52,802 --> 00:59:56,238
Now go outside, count to ten,
and then knock.

707
00:59:56,306 --> 00:59:59,571
When you hear me say,
"come in," you may enter.

708
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:05,376
Oh, Mary, translate that
for me, please.

709
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,550
Now, outside, please!

710
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:23,429
And it is customary, when leaving
a lady's room, to say " good night. "

711
01:00:25,735 --> 01:00:29,831
Did you hear what I said?
"Good night. "

712
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:35,778
Oh, Mary. Let's teach them
a little basic English.

713
01:00:35,845 --> 01:00:40,145
" Good night. " Now, come on.
It's not difficult.

714
01:00:40,216 --> 01:00:43,185
" Good night. "

715
01:00:43,253 --> 01:00:45,016
- Good night.
- Good night.

716
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:47,682
" Ladies. "

717
01:00:47,757 --> 01:00:51,523
- Ladies.
- Now, come on.

718
01:00:51,594 --> 01:00:55,360
- " Good night, ladies. "
- Good night, ladies.

719
01:00:55,432 --> 01:00:57,627
Now go.

720
01:00:57,701 --> 01:00:59,635
" Good night, ladies. "

721
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:21,779
She's come all this way!
Oh, you brilliant dog!

722
01:01:31,134 --> 01:01:33,068
You brilliant dog!

723
01:01:54,057 --> 01:01:56,218
I thought you'd be here.

724
01:01:56,292 --> 01:01:58,726
Come on. Let's sit down
for a moment.

725
01:02:00,063 --> 01:02:03,464
Do you know, I was so worried
after you went away.

726
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:05,660
I never knew
what happened to you.

727
01:02:05,735 --> 01:02:09,967
I did write to you from
that Nazi school. I promise I did.

728
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,237
- Perhaps they didn't post my letters.
- Oh, I'm sure they didn't.

729
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:16,745
" The English are the enemy,"
they said, over and over again.

730
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:20,010
But you're not
the enemy, Mary.

731
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:23,519
I'm afraid, in Italy now...

732
01:02:23,586 --> 01:02:25,986
I am the enemy, Luca.

733
01:02:26,056 --> 01:02:27,990
So you must be very careful.

734
01:02:28,058 --> 01:02:30,993
It could be quite dangerous
for you to come here often.

735
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:35,122
- But I can help you. There's the trust.
- What?

736
01:02:35,198 --> 01:02:38,656
The money Elsa gave me-
I can give it to you.

737
01:02:38,735 --> 01:02:41,966
I don't want you to do that.
That is your future.

738
01:02:42,038 --> 01:02:43,972
But thank you.

739
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,476
It's nice to know that
someone is looking after us.

740
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:57,711
I told you- Wait.
Stop cleaning those glasses.

741
01:02:57,787 --> 01:03:02,156
- Up, one on top of another.
- I think it is very difficult.

742
01:03:02,225 --> 01:03:05,319
A pyramid. That's when-

743
01:03:06,529 --> 01:03:08,292
She's crazy...

744
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:10,730
completely crazy.

745
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,598
What have you done to her?

746
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,639
Elsa is in love!

747
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:19,139
Unbelievable!

748
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:21,473
You should get her
to buy my Modigliani.

749
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:25,446
It is a bargain.
Everyone is selling up nowadays.

750
01:03:25,515 --> 01:03:28,006
Have you see how many pictures
and sculptures she's bought already?

751
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:32,043
I'm trying to calm her down, Sam-
put some order into her life.

752
01:03:32,122 --> 01:03:36,286
- Don't even show it to her.
- Pity. Then I'll take it to New York.

753
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:38,520
Oh, thank you.
You're leaving?

754
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:42,463
I certainly am.
I have sold the gallery.

755
01:03:42,532 --> 01:03:45,296
I'm joining the general stampede,
I'm afraid.

756
01:03:45,368 --> 01:03:50,203
- Europe just isn't home anymore.
- My dear Sam, why ever not?

757
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:55,176
Accident of birth, I suppose.
It is never a good time to be a Jew.

758
01:03:55,245 --> 01:04:00,706
Vittorio is right.
Elsa must stop this folly.

759
01:04:00,783 --> 01:04:04,617
Send the collection to Switzerland.
Get out fast.

760
01:04:31,948 --> 01:04:34,178
All right, come on.
Don't open your eyes.

761
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:37,947
We're almost there.
Don't open your eyes.

762
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:39,955
You can open your eyes!

763
01:04:40,023 --> 01:04:42,856
Isn't it unbelievable?
Isn't this fabulous?

764
01:04:44,827 --> 01:04:47,625
You should have seen this house
before I fixed it.

765
01:04:47,697 --> 01:04:50,257
Isn't this amazing?

766
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:56,463
This is Picasso.
It's one of his most famous paintings.

767
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:59,406
It's called
Desmoiselles d'Avignon.

768
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:02,603
I almost lost this painting once.

769
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:07,116
But, you know, I really want something,
I don't give up till I get it.

770
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:09,481
De Chirico.

771
01:05:11,387 --> 01:05:15,323
Frightens the hell out of you,
doesn't it?

772
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:19,122
- Luca, can you do me a little favor?
- A favor? Of course.

773
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:21,493
Now, you gotta be responsible.
I have to be able to trust you.

774
01:05:21,564 --> 01:05:23,464
I'll be responsible.

775
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:26,969
This is my favorite. Balla-
another great Italian.

776
01:05:27,036 --> 01:05:31,939
An explosion
of color and light.

777
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:36,278
Makes you feel.
Makes you think.

778
01:05:40,183 --> 01:05:42,617
And I spend my time
learning how to draw the past.

779
01:05:42,685 --> 01:05:45,245
Oh, no!
You have to study the classics.

780
01:05:45,321 --> 01:05:49,280
It's essential that you know the basics
before you go off and experiment.

781
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,488
- Like Picasso.
- Exactly.

782
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:56,724
I can trust you.
Come on.

783
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:00,535
Come on!

784
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:05,497
Close the door.

785
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:09,274
And take off your shirt.

786
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:16,183
Come on, Luca. Unbutton your shirt.
I don't have all day.

787
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:22,123
Here.

788
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:28,857
- Does anybody take care of your clothes?
- I live alone.

789
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:32,128
Luca, I need you to deliver
this package for me tonight.

790
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:35,602
These are
very important documents.

791
01:06:35,672 --> 01:06:38,698
It's imperative that
no one find out about it.

792
01:06:38,775 --> 01:06:40,709
So, here.

793
01:06:42,879 --> 01:06:46,337
This is the address.
Memorize it, and then burn it.

794
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:50,045
Maybe with your baby face
no one will suspect.

795
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:53,179
Meet me tomorrow
at Doney's at 12:00.

796
01:07:19,115 --> 01:07:21,015
Didn't you hear the alarm?
What are you doing here?

797
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:23,917
I'm looking for a shelter.
I can't find one.

798
01:07:23,986 --> 01:07:25,977
Show me your documents.

799
01:07:40,336 --> 01:07:43,066
Go home to your mother. Run!

800
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:34,448
The passports.

801
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:44,700
You cannot believe
the good you've done.

802
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:47,395
This is gonna make
so many people happy.

803
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,870
Have you ever had
champagne before?

804
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:55,677
To the old Scorpioni
in San Gimignano.

805
01:08:55,745 --> 01:09:00,182
And let's see if we can cheer them up,
but it's got to be our secret.

806
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:08,789
Now, after your next mission...

807
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:12,521
what would you think
about dinner at the villa?

808
01:09:12,595 --> 01:09:16,292
I think I can rustle up a chicken.
We can talk about painting-

809
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:18,560
Thursday night, 9:00.

810
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,004
I think I might be free.

811
01:09:23,072 --> 01:09:25,700
Oh, you think
you might be free.

812
01:09:25,775 --> 01:09:29,711
Cigarettes, champagne,
"I think I might be free-"

813
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:32,077
Are we a man now?

814
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:36,084
- Possibly.
- And such a handsome man.

815
01:10:01,944 --> 01:10:03,206
Orders from II Duce.

816
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:04,712
From whom?

817
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,304
II Duce.

818
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:08,577
Top secret.

819
01:10:08,651 --> 01:10:11,814
Not a word to anyone...

820
01:10:12,788 --> 01:10:14,483
especially the police.

821
01:10:14,557 --> 01:10:17,651
Just call the bank, understand?

822
01:10:17,727 --> 01:10:20,924
I understand. The bank.

823
01:10:34,243 --> 01:10:38,543
Can you believe it?
We're going to be moved to a hotel!

824
01:10:47,823 --> 01:10:52,385
Of course. Il Duce must have found out
some stupid underling made a mistake.

825
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:56,727
Amazing. You'd think Musso
would have other things on his mind-

826
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:58,733
like the war,
for instance.

827
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:05,407
Once upon a time this hotel had
a very high standard of service.

828
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:09,911
I stayed here with my late husband,
the ambassador.

829
01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:13,176
My dear Lady Hester!

830
01:11:13,249 --> 01:11:15,308
Count Piero Bernardini.

831
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:18,945
A million apologies for not coming
to pay my respects earlier, but-

832
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:22,752
I had the honor
of knowing your husband.

833
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:26,261
I don't remember him ever
having mentioned your name.

834
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:27,455
In Rome.

835
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:30,021
Excuse me. Do you
know the manager here?

836
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:33,227
Menotti, Menotti.
Lady Hester.

837
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:39,702
You'll be having a good spring clean,
I hope. Thank you.

838
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:43,170
Thank you.

839
01:11:43,245 --> 01:11:46,146
- Thank you.
- Mr. Menotti...

840
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:49,446
we take afternoon tea at 4:00.

841
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:53,284
When I say 4:00, I mean 4:00.

842
01:11:53,356 --> 01:11:55,620
Not a quarter past, 4:00.

843
01:11:55,691 --> 01:11:58,125
Would you please put this
in a prominent position?

844
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:36,163
The story of the ladies-
I don't understand you sometimes.

845
01:12:36,232 --> 01:12:40,134
What makes you do it?
It's going to cost you a fortune!

846
01:12:40,202 --> 01:12:42,693
It's the way I am.
Sometimes I do crazy things.

847
01:12:42,772 --> 01:12:46,833
But they hate you!
They've always been mean to you.

848
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:49,275
I know, but they're old, amore.

849
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:52,212
And- I don't know.
I respect them.

850
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:54,715
And who's gonna take care
of them? Mussolini?

851
01:12:54,784 --> 01:12:58,515
- " I respect them. "
- I don't want to talk about this.

852
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:02,079
Fine, fine. Everything-
it's easy for you.

853
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,059
Obviously it's pointless
trying to have...

854
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:07,721
a serious conversation with you.

855
01:13:07,797 --> 01:13:11,460
But it's going to be very difficult
for me to get out of here.

856
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:14,002
False documents,
bribing people-

857
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:17,836
- I can take care of it.
- I will take care of myself.

858
01:13:17,907 --> 01:13:20,569
Still...

859
01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:23,908
it might very well be that
I won't be able to go with you.

860
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:29,281
If you can't go,
then I won't go.

861
01:13:31,487 --> 01:13:33,682
Does that make you
feel better, baby?

862
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:38,487
You are impossible, Elsa!

863
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:41,530
Yes, it would make me
very happy...

864
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:44,589
but it doesn't solve
our problems.

865
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:47,534
Oh, you Italians!
You're so dramatic!

866
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:50,265
Problems, problems.

867
01:13:50,339 --> 01:13:53,274
My biggest problem is what
am I gonna wear tonight?

868
01:14:08,591 --> 01:14:12,459
- Signora Elsa?
- Mrs. Strauss-Almerson is not at home.

869
01:14:12,528 --> 01:14:16,259
Not at home?
But she invited me to dinner.

870
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:19,799
" Come to dinner
at the villa," she said.

871
01:14:19,869 --> 01:14:22,633
" On Thursday. "
Today is Thursday, isn't it?

872
01:14:22,705 --> 01:14:25,970
As I said,
Mrs. Strauss-Almerson is not at home.

873
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:29,135
Would you care
to leave a message?

874
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:31,145
Give her these.

875
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:41,482
- What about pearls?
- Pearls is all right.

876
01:14:41,557 --> 01:14:43,422
But small ones, please.

877
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:48,793
- Black ones or white ones?
- What?

878
01:14:48,931 --> 01:14:51,832
Black ones or white ones?

879
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:56,634
Whatever you want, as long as you
don't wear too many jewels, as usual.

880
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:58,866
Thank you, darling.

881
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,669
Lady-

882
01:15:11,187 --> 01:15:15,146
Nonsense. You can't proibito dogs.
They've got souls, just like us.

883
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:18,682
Which pope was it that said that dogs
have souls too? You ought to know.

884
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:21,229
You work in a cathedral.
You know nothing about dogs' souls.

885
01:15:21,297 --> 01:15:25,666
I told you, no dogs are allowed
in the cathedral. Don't you understand?

886
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:28,294
Oh, never mind.
The light's fading anyway.

887
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:30,338
But we'll be back tomorrow.
Won't we?

888
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:36,033
You can come here
whenever you like...

889
01:15:36,111 --> 01:15:38,409
but you must leave your dog outside.

890
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,414
What kind of a Christian are you?

891
01:15:40,482 --> 01:15:45,249
You go on about one of God's creatures,
yet let these frescoes fall to pieces!

892
01:15:45,321 --> 01:15:47,255
Shame on you!

893
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,517
These are the documents Lady Hester
asked me to fetch from her villa.

894
01:16:16,585 --> 01:16:21,215
Thank you. Have you seen
anything of Elsa? How is she?

895
01:16:23,225 --> 01:16:26,490
How should I know?
I'm only the messenger boy.

896
01:16:26,562 --> 01:16:30,225
What's the matter?

897
01:16:30,299 --> 01:16:33,894
It's just, I don't want to be her
messenger boy any longer. That's all.

898
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:36,904
Luca, wait!

899
01:16:40,376 --> 01:16:44,107
What on Earth has happened?
She's always been so good to you.

900
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:47,910
She's a rich lady. She can afford
to be good to everybody...

901
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:49,883
including all of you.

902
01:16:49,952 --> 01:16:52,386
What are you talking about?

903
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:56,618
Who do you think is paying
your hotel bills? Mussolini?

904
01:16:56,692 --> 01:16:58,626
What do you mean?

905
01:16:58,694 --> 01:17:01,424
- It's Elsa!
- Elsa?

906
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:03,556
Yes, Elsa.

907
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:09,502
- Why, how very generous of her.
- Anyway, she has someone else.

908
01:17:09,571 --> 01:17:11,835
He can be her postman now.

909
01:17:16,045 --> 01:17:19,674
Ah. The green-eyed monster.

910
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,771
- Come on.
- All right!

911
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:59,418
- Wonderful!
- You marry me?

912
01:18:12,301 --> 01:18:19,070
We interrupt our broadcast
for a special communiqué.

913
01:18:19,942 --> 01:18:27,348
At dawn this morning,
the Japanese Air Force...

914
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:34,413
attacked the US Naval Base
at Pearl Harbor.

915
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:37,152
- What are they saying?
- Something about the Americans.

916
01:18:37,226 --> 01:18:40,354
The loss of human life is thought
to have been extremely heavy.

917
01:18:40,429 --> 01:18:41,555
Terrible loss of life.

918
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:45,122
President Roosevelt has called an
emergency session of the US Congress...

919
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,430
to declare war on Japan,
Germany and Italy.

920
01:18:47,503 --> 01:18:50,768
They're in the war.
The Americans are in the war!

921
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:56,775
America is our enemy?

922
01:18:56,845 --> 01:18:59,905
What will happen to my sister
and her family in Brooklyn?

923
01:18:59,982 --> 01:19:02,075
Will they arrest all of them?

924
01:19:10,859 --> 01:19:13,794
- Georgie, darling!
- You'll never believe how I missed you.

925
01:19:16,165 --> 01:19:18,326
Hon- Ursula!

926
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:31,710
Oh, I wish this hadn't
happened to you. I'm so sorry.

927
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:35,716
Oh, honey, don't be.
Now we can all be enemy aliens together.

928
01:19:35,784 --> 01:19:39,743
- We'll make it a party!
- This isn't going to be a party.

929
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:44,725
I am sorry you've been separated
from your dance partners.

930
01:19:44,793 --> 01:19:47,421
Now you're about to find out
what it's like to be at war.

931
01:19:47,496 --> 01:19:50,659
Well, this isn't exactly
the trenches, is it, Hester?

932
01:19:50,732 --> 01:19:54,634
Thanks to the generosity of II Duce,
we are being treated with dignity.

933
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:58,935
Whether he wishes
to extend his generosity...

934
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:01,874
to American citizens
is quite another matter.

935
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:04,469
Come on, gals. We don't need
to fight. We've got to live together.

936
01:20:04,546 --> 01:20:07,709
That means behaving
like gentlemen. Right, Lucy?

937
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:28,261
I can't take this much longer.

938
01:20:28,337 --> 01:20:31,932
I'm 22. Nobody seems
to remember that.

939
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:34,441
She thinks I'm still a child.

940
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:37,968
- She's doing it to save your life.
- What life?

941
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:44,448
How much longer do I have to stay here,
wasting my life like a fool?

942
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,115
It was the only thing
she could think of to do.

943
01:20:49,324 --> 01:20:52,157
People will do anything
for someone they love.

944
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:56,254
Making me live like this-
you call that love?

945
01:20:56,331 --> 01:20:58,993
Yes. Yes, it is love.

946
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:02,298
Whatever it may seem to you,
it is love!

947
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:08,909
I-

948
01:21:12,347 --> 01:21:16,545
I lost the two men
I loved the most in a war.

949
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,614
But I wasn't given a choice.

950
01:21:23,525 --> 01:21:27,188
If I were in Hester's place...

951
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:31,322
I might do the same as she.

952
01:21:34,303 --> 01:21:36,794
Whatever you want.

953
01:21:36,905 --> 01:21:40,568
Send her something warm.

954
01:21:40,642 --> 01:21:43,406
You know what she'll need.

955
01:21:44,346 --> 01:21:48,214
They haven't even given her time
to take a handkerchief.

956
01:21:51,653 --> 01:21:55,180
She left a letter for you.

957
01:22:00,162 --> 01:22:04,258
The Swiss consul will come
this afternoon with some experts.

958
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,267
They might be in
for some big surprises.

959
01:22:06,335 --> 01:22:08,963
Like that fake Picasso
and those Legers.

960
01:22:09,037 --> 01:22:10,971
Anyway, fake or real...

961
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:15,874
they must know that the pictures
belong to a foreign company.

962
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:18,936
Elsa doesn't own anything.
Officially!

963
01:22:19,014 --> 01:22:22,074
Not even the villa or the rest.

964
01:22:23,185 --> 01:22:26,052
She never talked to me about it.

965
01:22:26,121 --> 01:22:29,284
She always signed everything herself.

966
01:22:29,358 --> 01:22:32,293
Elsa's crazy but not to the point...

967
01:22:32,361 --> 01:22:35,421
of refusing to protect herself
from potential problems.

968
01:22:36,632 --> 01:22:41,069
And it was you who advised her
how to avoid these problems?

969
01:22:41,136 --> 01:22:43,604
Not me, my law firm.

970
01:22:52,481 --> 01:22:57,043
Elsa, we've been invited
to a party on New Year's Eve!

971
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:00,179
- And you've been invited too!
- At Count Bernardini's palazzo.

972
01:23:00,255 --> 01:23:03,122
Elsa, darling, you wouldn't have
a pair of stockings, would you?

973
01:23:03,258 --> 01:23:06,989
- I don't know.
- May we look in your luggage?

974
01:23:07,062 --> 01:23:09,030
Yes, yes. Go ahead.

975
01:23:09,097 --> 01:23:11,759
You're a darling!

976
01:23:13,268 --> 01:23:16,169
Oh, Elsa, Elsa,
please may I have this?

977
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:19,207
- Yes, Hazel. It's you. You keep it.
- Thank you!

978
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:23,574
- Do you think it suits me?
- Yes, Molly.

979
01:23:26,014 --> 01:23:27,982
Oh, my God!

980
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:31,644
Does my butler think I'm wintering
in Monte Carlo, for God's sake?

981
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,654
Silk stockings!

982
01:23:35,657 --> 01:23:38,626
Oh, I don't believe it!

983
01:23:38,694 --> 01:23:41,162
You can feel them!
Wonderful!

984
01:23:41,229 --> 01:23:43,163
Feel the silk!

985
01:24:07,322 --> 01:24:09,313
Would you like some?

986
01:24:17,299 --> 01:24:19,927
Oh, grazie, Luca.
Thank you.

987
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:25,033
Signor Innocenti.

988
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:27,007
Good evening, signora.

989
01:24:28,076 --> 01:24:30,271
Luca, stop this nonsense.

990
01:24:30,345 --> 01:24:33,576
You know you're gonna
forgive me in the end anyway.

991
01:24:33,648 --> 01:24:36,879
All right, so I am a dizzy dame
with the memory of a fruit fly...

992
01:24:36,952 --> 01:24:40,683
but I love you, and I would
never do anything to hurt you, ever.

993
01:24:43,258 --> 01:24:47,024
Look at them.
Look how adorable they look.

994
01:24:47,095 --> 01:24:49,290
Do you know how happy it would
make your mother to know the joy...

995
01:24:49,364 --> 01:24:52,959
that she's brought a bunch
of old crazy English ladies?

996
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:57,037
I think they look better on them
than they did on me.

997
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,466
Dance with me.

998
01:25:02,611 --> 01:25:05,239
Come on.
Please dance with me, Luca.

999
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:11,111
Come on, now.
It's not that awful.

1000
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:15,089
Lady Hester, ma'am...

1001
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:17,284
may I have the pleasure
of dancin' with Miss Lucy?

1002
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:20,226
- Oh, Georgie-
- Come on, gal.

1003
01:25:20,295 --> 01:25:23,526
Goodness' sake!
Oh, Georgie, don't.

1004
01:25:23,598 --> 01:25:26,328
I really don't- Georgie!

1005
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:35,509
Hi.

1006
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:46,751
- You look lovely. I love that dress.
- Thank you.

1007
01:25:46,822 --> 01:25:49,791
Actually, I love that dress.
That's my favorite dress.

1008
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:53,294
Okay, enough of this flirting.

1009
01:25:53,361 --> 01:25:56,455
I don't like you behaving this way
when you're out with me.

1010
01:26:14,516 --> 01:26:17,781
Thank you.
I'll be right back.

1011
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:37,497
Hey. Miss Elsa,
you look wonderful.

1012
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:40,632
How could I not come
to kiss you on New Year's Eve?

1013
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:43,872
Listen, I have some
very important news.

1014
01:26:43,945 --> 01:26:45,845
Come this way.

1015
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:54,985
Get ready.
You're going to Switzerland.

1016
01:26:55,056 --> 01:26:57,217
But how can I get
to Switzerland?

1017
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:59,226
There. A diplomatic passport.

1018
01:26:59,294 --> 01:27:03,128
But listen carefully. We can't
travel together. It's too dangerous.

1019
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:06,895
You'll go first. I'll cross
the border with a Dutch passport.

1020
01:27:06,968 --> 01:27:09,960
In a few days, we'll be
together again in Zurich.

1021
01:27:10,038 --> 01:27:14,099
All I need you to do is sign
the last of the company papers.

1022
01:27:14,175 --> 01:27:16,405
- There.
- Yes.

1023
01:27:16,478 --> 01:27:18,412
- Don't be afraid.
- No.

1024
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,414
- And there.
- Yes.

1025
01:27:20,482 --> 01:27:22,882
Everything will be fine.

1026
01:27:22,951 --> 01:27:27,285
Now I must go. I have many details
to attend to and Mama's waiting.

1027
01:27:29,558 --> 01:27:32,186
- Listen. Everything will be fine.
- I know, but-

1028
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:35,593
- It's a matter of days.
- How will I know? Who will contact me?

1029
01:27:35,664 --> 01:27:38,599
Somebody will contact you.
Trust me.

1030
01:27:41,436 --> 01:27:43,267
And remember:

1031
01:27:43,338 --> 01:27:45,363
I am doing all of this for us...

1032
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:48,568
so we can be together, in America.

1033
01:27:54,249 --> 01:27:58,879
When we remember the cruelties...

1034
01:27:58,954 --> 01:28:04,017
with which the German armies
are now afflicting almost all Europe...

1035
01:28:04,092 --> 01:28:08,586
when we read every week
of the mass executions of Poles...

1036
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:14,363
Norwegians, Dutchmen, Belgians,
Czechoslovakians, Frenchmen...

1037
01:28:14,436 --> 01:28:16,495
- Yugoslavs and Greeks...
- What's happened? What did he say?

1038
01:28:16,571 --> 01:28:19,438
when we see these ancient
and honored countries...

1039
01:28:19,507 --> 01:28:23,409
whose deeds and traditions
Europe is the heir...

1040
01:28:23,478 --> 01:28:27,915
when we see them writhing under
this hateful and merciless alien yoke...

1041
01:28:27,983 --> 01:28:32,181
when we see their patriots
striking back with every week...

1042
01:28:32,253 --> 01:28:35,984
a fiercer and more furious
desperation-

1043
01:28:36,057 --> 01:28:39,288
when we see all that,
we may feel sure...

1044
01:28:39,361 --> 01:28:42,489
that we bear the sword of justice.

1045
01:28:42,564 --> 01:28:45,829
And we are resolved
to use that sword...

1046
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:49,768
with the utmost severity
to the full and to the end.

1047
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:28,632
- Wilfred!
- Nice.

1048
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:31,838
- Wilfred!
- Lucy-

1049
01:29:31,913 --> 01:29:34,245
- I'm not Lucy!
- Lucy-

1050
01:29:34,315 --> 01:29:37,182
- Lucy-
- I'm not Lucy! I'm Wilfred!

1051
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:39,982
You are wonderful
without your hair.

1052
01:29:40,055 --> 01:29:42,421
I'm a man. I'm a man!

1053
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:57,363
I'm a man!
I'm a man! I'm a man!

1054
01:29:57,439 --> 01:29:59,634
- I'm a-
- Wilfred!

1055
01:30:57,499 --> 01:30:59,967
Did you know Professor Cassuto
was a Jew?

1056
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:03,001
Where are they taking him?

1057
01:31:03,071 --> 01:31:04,436
Wherever they take him...

1058
01:31:04,506 --> 01:31:05,996
we'll never see him again.

1059
01:31:36,938 --> 01:31:39,133
We are here, we are here

1060
01:31:39,207 --> 01:31:44,406
Ghirlandaio, Ghirlandaio
We are here, we are here

1061
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:49,712
- Santa Fina, we are here
- We must hurry. That's right.

1062
01:31:49,784 --> 01:31:52,446
Let's put it down here.

1063
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:57,548
- Keep the music going!
- Come on. Come on!

1064
01:31:57,692 --> 01:32:00,058
Georgie, Georgie!
Wait, wait! Look!

1065
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:04,121
Shouldn't we have some canvas to protect
her? Mattresses, something like that.

1066
01:32:04,265 --> 01:32:07,098
It's fine. It's good. As long as
it's not touching, don't worry.

1067
01:32:07,168 --> 01:32:09,363
Well, you do it.
I'm much too nervous.

1068
01:32:09,437 --> 01:32:11,632
Get some wine,
and bring me some.

1069
01:32:11,706 --> 01:32:15,642
- This is better than Earl Grey!
- I can't bear to watch that.

1070
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:18,543
It's made me so nervous.
Give me a drink.

1071
01:32:22,917 --> 01:32:26,444
I'm terribly worried.
I've heard nothing more from Wilfred.

1072
01:32:26,521 --> 01:32:28,785
- Luca gave you the message. He's safe.
- Yes, I know-

1073
01:32:28,857 --> 01:32:32,315
- Safe? With those terrorists?
- He's fighting for freedom.

1074
01:32:32,393 --> 01:32:35,191
You said Wilfred always did the
right thing. You should be proud of him.

1075
01:32:35,263 --> 01:32:37,754
I am, I am.
But he'd be safer here with me.

1076
01:32:37,832 --> 01:32:41,233
You can't keep him wrapped up forever.
He's fine now. Think of him.

1077
01:32:41,302 --> 01:32:43,770
Well, haven't I been?

1078
01:32:43,838 --> 01:32:48,468
Perhaps you've been thinking more about
yourself. Do you mind my saying that?

1079
01:32:48,543 --> 01:32:51,876
Yes, of course I do.

1080
01:32:57,886 --> 01:33:00,787
Oh, I hope she's all right.

1081
01:33:00,855 --> 01:33:04,382
Sleep well, Santa Fina,
until it's safe to wake you up.

1082
01:33:06,861 --> 01:33:11,560
Santa Fina, Santa Fina
We are here, we are here

1083
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:14,829
Yes. Yes, it's true.

1084
01:33:14,903 --> 01:33:18,862
Vittorio had so many arrested.
Some I knew very well.

1085
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:22,740
Old friends-
they never returned!

1086
01:33:25,146 --> 01:33:30,607
But if he didn't really love Elsa,
why didn't he have her arrested before?

1087
01:33:30,685 --> 01:33:34,985
Because he had other plans.
He controls everything she owns.

1088
01:33:35,056 --> 01:33:39,550
He'll take it all! That's why
Elsa has to die. You understand?

1089
01:33:39,627 --> 01:33:41,561
Yes, it's true.

1090
01:33:41,629 --> 01:33:44,655
Oh, please. Please.

1091
01:33:44,732 --> 01:33:49,032
I love Elsa.
She is a great friend.

1092
01:33:49,103 --> 01:33:52,004
I feel responsible.

1093
01:33:54,609 --> 01:33:58,238
I understood it all too late.

1094
01:34:01,516 --> 01:34:03,814
We'll do everything we can.

1095
01:34:12,293 --> 01:34:17,162
You knew all this.
You didn't tell Elsa or me?

1096
01:34:17,231 --> 01:34:19,927
You'd have accused me
of being jealous.

1097
01:34:21,102 --> 01:34:24,799
Jealous? Luca,
what were you thinking of?

1098
01:34:24,872 --> 01:34:27,136
What does it matter
about your hurt feelings...

1099
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:30,109
when you know someone's life
is in danger?

1100
01:34:30,178 --> 01:34:35,548
Someone who's given so much
and made everything possible for you?

1101
01:34:35,616 --> 01:34:38,141
Oh, how could you be
so childish?

1102
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,153
So ungrateful?

1103
01:34:41,789 --> 01:34:43,950
It's time to grow up, Luca.

1104
01:34:44,025 --> 01:34:46,755
We all have to grow up sometime.

1105
01:34:56,437 --> 01:34:58,598
Luca! Luca, how are you?

1106
01:35:03,111 --> 01:35:06,638
It isn't easy-
but we've saved other Jews before.

1107
01:35:06,714 --> 01:35:09,581
Unfortunately, there's
a problem with money.

1108
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:12,585
A lot of people are
risking their lives.

1109
01:35:14,889 --> 01:35:17,687
What have you done-
robbed a bank?

1110
01:35:17,759 --> 01:35:18,919
Hurry up!

1111
01:35:20,595 --> 01:35:24,292
I say, Luca.
I didn't know you were so rich.

1112
01:35:24,365 --> 01:35:27,926
No, I'm not.
That's not my money.

1113
01:35:28,002 --> 01:35:32,371
It was meant to help me grow up.
But it doesn't seem to have worked.

1114
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,534
Well, what's happened?

1115
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:40,047
Once upon a time, my father wanted me
to be a perfect English gentleman.

1116
01:35:41,115 --> 01:35:43,583
But I forgot the first rule:

1117
01:35:44,986 --> 01:35:46,954
" Love thyself last. "

1118
01:35:47,021 --> 01:35:50,582
- Shakespeare.
- Who else?

1119
01:35:57,498 --> 01:36:01,059
Mary wants us to help
Mrs. Strauss-Almerson escape.

1120
01:36:01,135 --> 01:36:03,069
I don't see why
we should be involved.

1121
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:07,335
She's got a passport. She's got papers
all provided by her Italian friend.

1122
01:36:07,408 --> 01:36:10,969
- Passport- it's a death warrant.
- How can we be sure of that?

1123
01:36:11,045 --> 01:36:15,106
- She can make her own arrangements.
- She's too damn scared to move.

1124
01:36:15,183 --> 01:36:17,811
Oh, well, if she can't move,
she better stay where she is.

1125
01:36:17,885 --> 01:36:21,446
- What have you got against Elsa?
- Nothing in particular.

1126
01:36:21,522 --> 01:36:24,719
Oh, yes, you have.
She's American.

1127
01:36:24,792 --> 01:36:26,919
And she's a Jew.

1128
01:36:26,994 --> 01:36:31,590
It isn't that.
She's a flagrantly immoral woman.

1129
01:36:31,666 --> 01:36:34,601
Oh, Hester, come off it. She's not the
only one. Some people in this room...

1130
01:36:34,669 --> 01:36:37,934
have been having it with every pair
of pants in sight, civil and military.

1131
01:36:38,005 --> 01:36:40,803
- Not yours, thank God.
- Oh, I second that.

1132
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:45,005
I experience life, and I owe it
to my talent as a writer.

1133
01:36:45,079 --> 01:36:50,278
As a matter of fact, I have
an announcement. I'm writing a book:

1134
01:36:50,351 --> 01:36:53,343
my memoirs,
Letters from San Gimignano.

1135
01:36:53,421 --> 01:36:55,981
- Another Lady Chatterly.
- Rescuing Elsa...

1136
01:36:56,057 --> 01:36:58,491
would be a wonderful story
for my book.

1137
01:36:58,559 --> 01:37:03,326
Story? This is not a story.
We could all get shot!

1138
01:37:03,397 --> 01:37:05,991
Shot! I've got
the frescoes to save!

1139
01:37:06,067 --> 01:37:08,558
Arabella, you might love art...

1140
01:37:08,636 --> 01:37:11,332
but art certainly doesn't
respond to your affections.

1141
01:37:11,405 --> 01:37:15,808
- Lady Hester, please!
- No, perhaps she's right.

1142
01:37:15,877 --> 01:37:17,811
Perhaps I'm no good.

1143
01:37:17,879 --> 01:37:20,848
Maybe I can't paint
the way I would like to...

1144
01:37:20,915 --> 01:37:23,179
but nor could
Ghirlandaio or Titian.

1145
01:37:23,251 --> 01:37:26,846
I mean, look at Schubert-
he never even finished that symphony.

1146
01:37:26,921 --> 01:37:29,583
All artists fail,
and perhaps I've failed more than most.

1147
01:37:29,657 --> 01:37:33,252
More than others. But since
I've been in this beautiful place...

1148
01:37:33,327 --> 01:37:36,387
I feel that there is
more that I can do...

1149
01:37:36,464 --> 01:37:40,798
that there is a way
of making people understand, that I-

1150
01:37:40,868 --> 01:37:44,326
- Oh, God!
- Arabella, just please don't start.

1151
01:37:44,405 --> 01:37:48,171
- Perhaps we should stop quarrelling.
- I'm enjoying it, aren't you?

1152
01:37:48,242 --> 01:37:54,044
I'm not quarrelling, I'm simply asking
why we should risk our lives for hers.

1153
01:37:54,115 --> 01:37:57,949
Because she is
in terrible danger.

1154
01:37:58,019 --> 01:38:00,249
She's just waiting there.

1155
01:38:00,321 --> 01:38:05,122
She's put her trust in a man who has
no intention of helping her to escape.

1156
01:38:06,761 --> 01:38:10,629
She signed over
all her property to him...

1157
01:38:10,698 --> 01:38:12,825
and now he's planning
to get rid of her.

1158
01:38:15,436 --> 01:38:21,306
Luca and I have tried to tell her.
She won't listen to a word against him.

1159
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:26,403
So she's waiting there
for Vittorio...

1160
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:30,507
and what will be coming
is the Gestapo.

1161
01:38:32,587 --> 01:38:34,953
Oh, Hester,
you've got to tell her to go.

1162
01:38:35,022 --> 01:38:37,422
Luca and his friends
have everything ready.

1163
01:38:37,491 --> 01:38:43,259
But why me? She doesn't like me.
I certainly don't like her.

1164
01:38:43,331 --> 01:38:47,199
- That's exactly why.
- And because you owe it to her.

1165
01:38:47,268 --> 01:38:49,031
I don't owe that woman anything.

1166
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:58,702
Do you really believe Mussolini
has been paying these hotel bills?

1167
01:38:58,779 --> 01:39:01,373
Yes. Of course-
Who else?

1168
01:39:01,449 --> 01:39:04,213
Stop living in
a fantasy world, Hester.

1169
01:39:05,686 --> 01:39:09,554
Mussolini doesn't give a damn
about you or any of us.

1170
01:39:10,725 --> 01:39:15,321
It's Elsa
who has paid the bills...

1171
01:39:15,396 --> 01:39:18,388
and never once
asked to be thanked.

1172
01:39:18,466 --> 01:39:21,924
Ask Luca.
He arranged everything.

1173
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:35,941
Luca, is this true?

1174
01:39:36,017 --> 01:39:39,077
Yes, Lady Hester.

1175
01:40:05,346 --> 01:40:07,439
Elsa? It's Lady Hester.

1176
01:40:07,515 --> 01:40:11,007
- Open this door. I must speak with you.
- Go away.

1177
01:40:11,085 --> 01:40:13,952
I have a message
from Vittorio.

1178
01:40:35,976 --> 01:40:38,740
Aren't you rather
letting yourself go?

1179
01:40:38,813 --> 01:40:41,611
Give me the goddamn
message, Hester.

1180
01:40:41,682 --> 01:40:44,344
His message is perfectly clear.

1181
01:40:44,418 --> 01:40:47,012
Mary tells me you've signed
everything over to him.

1182
01:40:47,088 --> 01:40:51,047
- All your property?
- Yes.

1183
01:40:51,125 --> 01:40:53,559
- And all your money?
- Yes.

1184
01:40:53,627 --> 01:40:57,290
Well, now he has everything you possess,
he wants you arrested and probably dead.

1185
01:40:57,365 --> 01:40:59,333
He won't be coming here.

1186
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,198
He's keeping well away.
He's leaving everything to the Gestapo.

1187
01:41:02,269 --> 01:41:04,237
But I have a passport.

1188
01:41:04,305 --> 01:41:07,706
The passport is worth nothing.
Georgie says it's a death warrant.

1189
01:41:07,775 --> 01:41:09,936
I'm scared.

1190
01:41:10,010 --> 01:41:14,640
Yes, well, yes,
of course you are. We all are.

1191
01:41:15,883 --> 01:41:18,579
Luca will help you,
he and his friends.

1192
01:41:18,652 --> 01:41:20,745
My grandson's with them.
They will help you out of Italy.

1193
01:41:20,821 --> 01:41:24,723
You must get ready, please.
What do you want to take?

1194
01:41:24,792 --> 01:41:27,625
- I don't- This.
- All right.

1195
01:41:29,163 --> 01:41:31,097
Why are you helping me?

1196
01:41:31,165 --> 01:41:33,190
You always hated me.

1197
01:41:34,702 --> 01:41:38,502
Because we're creatures
from two different worlds, you and I.

1198
01:41:38,572 --> 01:41:43,202
Because I have despised you,
and you have laughed at me.

1199
01:41:43,277 --> 01:41:45,268
The " Scorpioni. "

1200
01:41:45,346 --> 01:41:47,246
And because,
in spite of all that...

1201
01:41:47,314 --> 01:41:50,806
you've been very kind to us
and kept it a secret.

1202
01:41:52,386 --> 01:41:56,220
And because we've both been
very foolish women.

1203
01:41:56,290 --> 01:42:01,023
We've both trusted men
who have turned out to be bastards.

1204
01:42:01,095 --> 01:42:04,622
- Vittorio.
- And Mussolini.

1205
01:42:04,698 --> 01:42:06,859
Come on, come.

1206
01:42:06,934 --> 01:42:10,927
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- Absolutely.

1207
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,810
- Oh, you look so great in trousers.
- Thank you.

1208
01:42:22,883 --> 01:42:25,408
- I've just been with your grandmother.
- How is she?

1209
01:42:25,486 --> 01:42:27,545
She's wonderful, and she's so proud
of you, and I'm proud of you too.

1210
01:42:27,621 --> 01:42:29,748
Come on, come on.

1211
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:34,023
- Remain here until the boat comes.
- Okay.

1212
01:42:36,897 --> 01:42:40,833
Come here. I don't know how much time
we have. I wanna tell you something.

1213
01:42:42,470 --> 01:42:45,633
I remember when your mother
was in trouble.

1214
01:42:45,706 --> 01:42:48,573
- My mother?
- Yes, you were the trouble.

1215
01:42:48,642 --> 01:42:50,576
- Me?
- Yes.

1216
01:42:50,644 --> 01:42:55,445
Your mother was pregnant. We knew your
dad was a liar and wouldn't marry her.

1217
01:42:55,516 --> 01:42:59,418
So none of her friends wanted her
to go through with it.

1218
01:42:59,487 --> 01:43:04,117
I want you to know something:
She really wanted you.

1219
01:43:04,191 --> 01:43:07,422
And so I said,
"Don't listen to them. They're idiots.

1220
01:43:07,495 --> 01:43:10,931
Just follow your heart,
and if you want him, have him. "

1221
01:43:13,033 --> 01:43:17,970
So, if I hadn't been there for you then,
you wouldn't be here for me now.

1222
01:43:19,406 --> 01:43:22,102
I wish you didn't have to go.

1223
01:43:22,176 --> 01:43:27,978
I wish I didn't have to go either.
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1224
01:43:28,048 --> 01:43:30,710
I'll always remember you.

1225
01:43:30,784 --> 01:43:34,686
When I come back, and you've got
a beautiful wife and a bunch of kids...

1226
01:43:34,755 --> 01:43:37,588
you won't remember me.

1227
01:43:37,658 --> 01:43:39,990
I'll still never forget you.

1228
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:43,257
Well, yeah,
I am very unforgettable.

1229
01:43:44,999 --> 01:43:49,095
But don't tell her that. You know women
get their feelings hurt so easily.

1230
01:43:51,939 --> 01:43:54,874
- The boat's here. It's time to go.
- Okay, okay.

1231
01:44:05,986 --> 01:44:09,752
There's a boat waiting to meet you about
a mile out that will take you to safety.

1232
01:44:09,823 --> 01:44:11,757
Good luck.

1233
01:45:33,007 --> 01:45:34,975
Are you Americans?

1234
01:45:42,549 --> 01:45:45,712
- Are you English?
- No!

1235
01:45:47,321 --> 01:45:50,085
We're not bloody
English, laddie.

1236
01:45:50,157 --> 01:45:53,388
We're bloody Scots.

1237
01:46:55,255 --> 01:46:58,884
They're not gonna blow up the towers?
No, we can't let them do that.

1238
01:47:01,829 --> 01:47:06,630
No, no! Let go of me! No!

1239
01:47:27,855 --> 01:47:30,153
Milady, milady, milady.

1240
01:47:30,224 --> 01:47:31,589
The lady with the dog.

1241
01:47:31,658 --> 01:47:34,593
She's tied herself
to one of the towers.

1242
01:47:42,169 --> 01:47:45,468
You have got five seconds
to get out of here. You understand?

1243
01:47:45,539 --> 01:47:47,905
Five seconds
to get away from here.

1244
01:47:47,975 --> 01:47:49,738
- Stop!
- One, two-

1245
01:47:49,810 --> 01:47:51,675
- Stop!
- Three-

1246
01:47:51,745 --> 01:47:53,838
Stop this nonsense at once!

1247
01:47:53,914 --> 01:47:56,849
You have no right to blow up these.
You have no right at all!

1248
01:47:56,917 --> 01:48:00,614
- Do you understand me?
- Get out of here, you old fools!

1249
01:48:00,687 --> 01:48:04,214
We are not old fools! You guard
that one. I'll go there. Come on.

1250
01:48:13,233 --> 01:48:19,001
Get out! Just you imagine what a hero
you'll be blowing up old ladies!

1251
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:21,563
They'll give you
the Iron Cross for that!

1252
01:48:21,642 --> 01:48:23,576
Shut up, you old fool!

1253
01:49:07,754 --> 01:49:09,244
In Berlin!

1254
01:50:24,998 --> 01:50:29,833
- No interpreter is needed for this job.
- Which job, sir?

1255
01:50:29,903 --> 01:50:32,736
A party of English ladies.
Old biddies...

1256
01:50:32,806 --> 01:50:35,206
under some sort of arrest
here in San Gimignano.

1257
01:50:35,275 --> 01:50:40,406
Orders are to move them to
a place of safety- down to Rome.

1258
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:44,007
Actually, I think you might
need an interpreter, sir.

1259
01:50:44,084 --> 01:50:47,576
- Why? Do you know them, Innocenti?
- Very well, sir.

1260
01:50:47,654 --> 01:50:50,919
- Do they not understand plain English?
- Yes...

1261
01:50:50,991 --> 01:50:53,926
but they don't understand orders.

1262
01:50:53,994 --> 01:50:56,485
Well, we'll see about that.

1263
01:51:28,762 --> 01:51:30,229
Now, ladies...

1264
01:51:31,898 --> 01:51:34,162
we've laid on transport
for 0900 hours.

1265
01:51:34,234 --> 01:51:37,829
- Collect your things. We'll move-
- Move? Who says?

1266
01:51:37,904 --> 01:51:40,395
- I do. I have orders.
- Orders!

1267
01:51:40,474 --> 01:51:43,568
My good man,
I'm Lady Hester Random.

1268
01:51:43,643 --> 01:51:46,510
My late husband was His Britannic
Majesty's Ambassador.

1269
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:49,208
See, I have,
as you may imagine...

1270
01:51:49,282 --> 01:51:51,443
a very special position here.

1271
01:51:51,518 --> 01:51:54,578
So will you excuse me, please?

1272
01:51:54,654 --> 01:51:58,886
Ladies, ladies, I must insist.
This is still the front line!

1273
01:51:58,959 --> 01:52:02,690
If you'll please go to the waiting
transport, we really must get moving.

1274
01:52:02,763 --> 01:52:04,731
Do be quiet,
Major whoever you are.

1275
01:52:04,798 --> 01:52:08,131
The Germans and the Italians
couldn't get rid of us.

1276
01:52:08,201 --> 01:52:11,398
There is absolutely no reason
why we should surrender to the Scots.

1277
01:52:18,445 --> 01:52:20,379
Miss Mary.

1278
01:52:26,453 --> 01:52:28,751
I thought we weren't
supposed to do that.

1279
01:52:28,822 --> 01:52:31,120
Let me look at you.

1280
01:52:31,191 --> 01:52:33,125
Oh, you look splendid.

1281
01:52:33,193 --> 01:52:35,388
The perfect
English gentleman.

1282
01:52:36,997 --> 01:52:40,023
Just what your father wanted.

1283
01:52:51,812 --> 01:52:54,747
Georgie, give me a hand.

1284
01:52:57,417 --> 01:52:59,442
Is she all right?
Is she all right?

1285
01:52:59,519 --> 01:53:02,955
Shh, let her sleep.
